Longtime tech critic Tim Wu is joining the Biden administration as an adviser on technology and competition, a signal that the White House is likely to push for policies that rein in Big Tech.Wu will be serving on the National Economic Council as special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy, the White House said this morning. Wu confirmed the news in a tweet.Wu is best known in tech circles as the man who coined the term ""net neutrality"" in the early 2000s. He has held several positions at the federal level before, including advisory roles with both the Federal Trade Commission and the National Economic Council. He has also been a full professor at Columbia University law school since 2006, where he teaches First Amendment and antitrust law. His 2010 book The Master Switch argued that the open Internet as we knew it was barreling toward a closed-off, walled-garden future. In 2018 he published another book, The Curse of Bigness, in which he argued that US regulators' failure to enforce antitrust laws had led to ""a new gilded age"" and all its attendant problems.Several prominent progressive Democratic lawmakers applauded the move. ""Tim has been a longtime antitrust advocate, and he has pushed public officials to break up and rein in Big Tech,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who called for Big Tech breakups during her unsuccessful presidential primary run in 2019. ""I’m glad to see him in this role.""Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who recently proposed a bill that would be the biggest antitrust overhaul since 1976 if enacted, also issued a statement in support of Wu's new job. ""It is clear this administration is serious about promoting competition in the United States,"" Klobuchar said. ""America has a major monopoly problem that must be urgently addressed... I look forward to working with Tim to modernize antitrust enforcement, strengthen our economy, and protect workers and consumers.""Those who oppose his policy goals seem to worry about how seriously the White House may now be taking him. One industry lobbyist, critical of Wu, told Protocol that the appointment ""should not be hand-waved away... This could be dangerous.""All that said, Wu's new role does not put him in a position to come leaping in with a metaphorical sledgehammer and start smashing up companies. The White House can make all the suggestions it wants, but actual antitrust enforcement comes from the Department of Justice and the FTC, both of which are still waiting to have new leadership nominated or confirmed. (Wu's appointment to the NEC makes it clear he is not landing at either of those agencies, although the Washington rumor mill had considered him a candidate for both.)Both agencies, however, are already neck-deep in landmark cases against Big Tech Firms. The FTC and a coalition of 47 states filed antitrust suits in December seeking to break up Facebook, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anticompetitive and should not have been allowed to happen.Similarly, the DOJ and multiple groups of states have filed major cases against Google, arguing that the search-advertising-phone-everything giant behaves anticompetitively. Although those suits, now mostly consolidated, do not explicitly seek a breakup of Google, they do stress that ""structural remedies"" may be necessary.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Internet service providers could be required to release ""broadband nutrition labels"" with detailed information about prices, speeds, and data caps under legislation introduced by US Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.).Craig's ""Broadband Consumer Transparency Act"" would bring back expanded transparency requirements that were eliminated when then-Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai repealed net neutrality rules and deregulated the broadband industry in December 2017.The bill ""would require straightforward disclosures in an easily understandable format to help consumers better understand the services they are purchasing and protect against hidden fees and sub-standard Internet performance,"" Craig said in a press release yesterday. The press release said the bill ""would require sellers of broadband services to provide the following information to all consumers"":The bill is simple and barely a page long. It directs the FCC to adopt ""regulations to promote and incentivize the widespread adoption of broadband consumer labels"" like the ones described in a public notice issued by the Obama-era FCC in April 2016. The bill would give the FCC one year to issue these rules.The bill's language saying the FCC must ""promote and incentivize"" adoption of broadband labels makes it sound like they would be optional for ISPs. But Craig said her bill would ""require"" the disclosures, and the bill text could be updated to make sure it matches the intent.The Obama-era broadband labels included monthly charges, data caps and overage charges, hardware rental fees, activation and installation fees, early termination fees, taxes and government-related fees, ""other monthly fees,"" typical speeds both upstream and downstream, latency, and packet loss. Here's what they looked like:The Obama-era FCC rules made the broadband nutrition labels optional but required ISPs to release the information online if they chose not to use the labels.""Internet service providers are notorious for keeping customers in the dark,"" Joshua Stager, deputy director at New America's Open Technology Institute, said in a press release yesterday. ""Hidden fees, surprise bills, and dense contracts are familiar problems to anyone that has dealt with these companies. Just this week, a report detailed how Comcast hides speed information from customers when they sign up for service.""Stager was referring to our report about how Comcast's website hides upload speeds until customers complete most of the checkout process and enter a valid credit card number. He also cited his own organization's Cost of Connectivity report, saying it showed that ""US Internet providers often bury information about service and price amid confusing contracts, hidden fees, and convoluted billing schemes,"" and a Consumer Reports study finding ""that cable companies added $450 in hidden fees to the average customer's bill [each year].""The Open Technology Institute has been calling for broadband truth-in-labeling rules for over a decade.""Congresswoman Craig's bill cuts through this confusion by creating a 'broadband nutrition label' that clearly discloses the cost and terms of internet plans,"" Stager said. ""This truth-in-billing legislation is urgently needed as millions of people rely on the Internet to work, learn, and live during the pandemic. Congress should pass this legislation as soon as possible. People need to know what they are paying for.""The House of Representatives approved a broadband nutrition label measure as part of a larger bill last year, but it didn't pass in the Senate. Passage would be more likely now that Democrats control both chambers of Congress.Even if the bill doesn't pass Congress this time around, the Democratic-led FCC could bring the disclosure requirements back. But no major regulatory changes will come out of the FCC until President Biden nominates another Democrat to break the 2-2 deadlock between Democrats and Republicans.FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel supported the transparency requirements, net neutrality rules, and common-carrier regulation of ISP. If Biden makes her the permanent chair, she is likely to reinstate regulations repealed by Pai once Democrats have an FCC majority.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

First it was SolarWinds, a reportedly Russian hacking campaign that stretches back almost a year and has felled at least nine US government agencies and countless private companies. Now it’s Hafnium, a Chinese group that’s been attacking a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server to sneak into victims’ email inboxes and beyond. The collective toll of these espionage sprees is still being uncovered. It may never be fully known.Countries spy on each other, everywhere, all the time. They always have. But the extent and sophistication of Russia's and China’s latest efforts still manage to shock. And the near-term fallout of both underscores just how tricky it can be to take the full measure of a campaign even after you’ve sniffed it out.By now you’re probably familiar with the basics of the SolarWinds attack: likely Russian hackers broke into the IT management firm’s networks and altered versions of its Orion network monitoring tool, exposing as many as 18,000 organizations. The actual number of SolarWinds victims is assumed to be much smaller, although security analysts have pegged it in at least the low hundreds so far. And as SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna has eagerly pointed out to anyone who will listen, his was not the only software supply chain company that the Russians hacked in this campaign, implying a much broader ecosystem of victims than anyone has yet accounted for.“It’s become clear that there’s much more to learn about this incident, its causes, its scope, its scale, and where we go from here,” said Senate Intelligence Committee chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) at a hearing related to the SolarWinds hack last week. Brandon Wales, acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, estimated in an interview with MIT Technology Review this week that it could take up to 18 months for US government systems alone to recover from the hacking spree, to say nothing of the private sector.That lack of clarity goes double for the Chinese hacking campaign that Microsoft disclosed Tuesday. First spotted by security firm Volexity, a nation-state group that Microsoft calls Hafnium has been using multiple zero-day exploits—which attack previously unknown vulnerabilities in software—to break into Exchange Servers, which manage email clients including Outlook. There, they could surreptitiously read through the email accounts of high-value targets.“You wouldn’t fault anyone for missing this,” says Veloxity founder Steven Adair, who says the activity they observed began on January 6 of this year. “They’re very targeted, and they’re not doing much to raise alarm bells.”This past weekend, though, Veloxity observed a marked shift in behavior, as hackers began using their Exchange Server foothold to aggressively burrow deeper into victim networks. “It was really serious before; someone having unrestricted access to your email at will is in a sense a worst-case scenario,” says Adair. “Them being able to also breach your network and write files steps it up a notch in terms of what someone can get to and how hard the cleanup can be.”Neither SolarWinds nor the Hafnium attacks have stopped, meaning the very concept of cleanup, at least broadly, remains a distant dream. It’s like trying to mop up an actively gushing oil tanker. “It is apparent that these attacks are still ongoing, and the threat actors are actively scanning the Internet in a ‘spray-and-pray’ type fashion, targeting whatever looks to be vulnerable,” says John Hammond, senior security researcher at threat detection firm Huntress, about the Hafnium campaign.Microsoft has released patches that will protect anyone using Exchange Server from the assault. But it’s only a matter of time before other hackers reverse engineer the fix to figure out how to exploit the vulnerabilities themselves; you can expect ransomware and cryptojacking groups to get in on the action posthaste.“It could become a complete free for all,” says Adair. “I would guess it could be trivial for someone to figure out components of this now that the patch is out.”The patch will protect anyone who installs it, but if past is prologue, that list will be far from comprehensive. Microsoft pushed a patch for the EternalBlue vulnerability in March 2017; two months later the WannaCry virus used the leaked NSA tool to rip through the Internet. A full two years after that, over a million devices were still vulnerable globally. Which means that Hafnium and the criminal groups it inspires have a very long belt they can add notches to.At the same time, none of this activity should be surprising. “There is definitely always a background level of state-sponsored espionage that is occurring through cyberspace,” says J. Michael Daniel, who previously served as cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration and is currently the president and CEO of the nonprofit Cyber Threat Alliance. The SolarWinds and Hafnium hackers just happened to get caught. And while the US has been increasingly willing to indict nation-state hackers—including from Russia and China—they typically do so for intellectual property theft or other flagrant violations of international norms. Spying? Not so much. That also makes deterrence a little trickier; in the Cold War you could just kick spies out of your country, an option that’s not available when they’re sitting behind a keyboard thousands of miles away.Which means you can expect the threads of SolarWinds and Hafnium to keep unspooling, probably for years, without ever reaching the end.“Will we find out more as time goes on that there was another supply chain compromise from SolarWinds, or more agencies? Maybe, maybe not,” says Volexity’s Adair. “They could have devastated a ton more and you never find out about it, either because the victims never know or they know but it doesn’t become public.” The same, he says, is true for Hafnium. “I don’t know that we’ll keep hearing about it forever, but the impact will be long-lasting,” Adair says. “It already is long-lasting, just based on what they’ve done so far.”This story originally appeared on wired.com.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

      / MoneyWatch
    Texas governor Greg Abbott said Facebook and Twitter are leading a ""dangerous movement to silence conservative voices and religious freedoms"" as he backed a state bill Friday that would allow any Texans temporarily removed or banned from Facebook or Twitter to sue the social media companies in order to get reinstated.The bill, introduced earlier this week by Republican state senators, is the latest of more than a dozen efforts that have emerged around the country in recent weeks, following the banning of former President Donald Trump from the two social media platforms in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot.At a press conference in Tyler, Texas, Abbott argued that the social media companies have the obligation under a 1996 federal law known as Section 230 to keep their platforms open, and that violations of that law by Facebook, Twitter and others give Texas the right to impose its own state-specific regulations. ""Big tech's efforts to censor conservative viewpoints is un-American, and we are not going to allow it in the Lone Star State,"" Abbott said.Texas state Senator Bryan Hughes, who sponsored the bill and spoke along with Abbott, said that all the state wanted to do was protect the freedoms of its citizens. ""We don't allow a cable company to cut off your television because of your religion,"" Hughes offered as a justification for the proposed law.A spokesperson for Facebook did not return a request for comment by CBS MoneyWatch. In the past, Facebook and other social media companies have said they have the right to monitor and ban users on their platforms when those users post speech that promotes violence.Many technology and media experts agree. Industry group TechNet in a statement said the Texas bill would lead to numerous unintended negative consequences, including exposing children to harmful content. ""Every day, millions of pieces of digital content are posted that show the exploitation of children, bullying, harassment, pornography and spam,"" TechNet said. ""This bill not only recklessly encourages companies to leave objectionable content in the public eye, but also creates a culture that supports frivolous lawsuits against American companies.""Sharon Bradford Franklin, the policy director of think tank New America's Open Technology Institute, said Abbott ""does not have a correct understanding"" of federal regulations. She said, in fact, that Section 230 gives social media platforms, and all websites, the ability to decide what speech they want to host and what speech they want to take down. While states can impose their own privacy laws on social media platforms, they are barred by federal law from enacting their own laws policing content on the platforms, Franklin added. ""If a law needs to be changed, Texas can't do it on its own,"" she said. ""I feel confident that any court would hold that a law passed by a state to regulate content on social media platforms is not allowed.""Conservatives have long claimed that they are censored on social media websites, even though there is little independent evidence to support that. A study released last month by New York University found no reliable backing for the contention that conservatives are regularly blacklisted on mainstream social media websites. Nonetheless, conservative censorship complaints have grown louder since Facebook, Twitter and others have sought to limit calls for violence in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. This year alone, Republican law makers in 20 states have introduced bills that would allow their citizens to sue social media companies if they are ""deplatformed,"" according to David Horowitz of the Media Coalition, a nonprofit focused on First Amendment issues. While states are trying to make the case that Facebook should be regulated like a public square, in which all speech is protected, Horowitz believes those states will have a hard time passing that level of regulation on their own. The biggest hurdle: The internet operates across state lines. Any new regulations imposed on Facebook in one state, for instance, would impact the company in another. ""There is no way for Texas to guarantee that its rules will govern just Texans,"" Horowitz said.What's more, Horowitz said, courts have long upheld that business owners have their own First Amendment rights of free speech as well. ""If a bookstore doesn't want to sell a book, the government can't force it to do so,"" said Horowitz. ""I think social media platforms have the same rights.""

Retinal implants can give artificial vision to the blind. Credit: Alain Herzog / 2021 EPFLBeing able to make blind people see again sounds like the stuff of miracles or even science fiction. And it has always been one of the biggest challenges for scientists. Diego Ghezzi, who holds the Medtronic Chair in Neuroengineering (LNE) at EPFL’s School of Engineering, has made this issue a research focus. Since 2015, he and his team have been developing a retinal implant that works with camera-equipped smart glasses and a microcomputer. “Our system is designed to give blind people a form of artificial vision by using electrodes to stimulate their retinal cells,” says Ghezzi.The camera embedded in the smart glasses captures images in the wearer’s field of vision, and sends the data to a microcomputer placed in one of the eyeglasses’ end-pieces. The microcomputer turns the data into light signals which are transmitted to electrodes in the retinal implant. The electrodes then stimulate the retina in such a way that the wearer sees a simplified, black-and-white version of the image. This simplified version is made up of dots of light that appear when the retinal cells are stimulated. However, wearers must learn to interpret the many dots of light in order to make out shapes and objects. “It’s like when you look at stars in the night sky — you can learn to recognize specific constellations. Blind patients would see something similar with our system,” says Ghezzi.Retinal implants can give artificial vision to the blind. Credit: Alain Herzog / 2021 EPFLThe only catch is that the system has not yet been tested on humans. The research team first needs to be certain of their results. “We aren’t yet authorized to implant our device in human patients, since obtaining the medical approval takes a long time. But we came up with a process for testing it virtually — a type of work-around,” says Ghezzi. More specifically, the engineers developed a virtual reality program that can simulate what patients would see with the implants. Their findings have just been published in Communication Materials.Two parameters are used to measure vision: field of vision and resolution. The engineers therefore used these same two parameters to evaluate their system. The retinal implants they developed contain 10,500 electrodes, with each one serving to generate a dot of light. “We weren’t sure if this would be too many electrodes or not enough. We had to find just the right number so that the reproduced image doesn’t become too hard to make out. The dots have to be far enough apart that patients can distinguish two of them close to each other, but there has to be enough of them to provide sufficient image resolution,” says Ghezzi.The engineers also had to make sure that each electrode could reliably produce a dot of light. Ghezzi explains: “We wanted to make sure that two electrodes don’t stimulate the same part of the retina. So we carried out electrophysiological tests that involved recording the activity of retinal ganglion cells. And the results confirmed that each electrode does indeed activate a different part of the retina.”The next step was to check whether 10,500 light dots provide good enough resolution — and that’s where the virtual reality program came in. “Our simulations showed that the chosen number of dots, and therefore of electrodes, works well. Using any more wouldn’t deliver any real benefits to patients in terms of definition,” says Ghezzi.The engineers also performed tests at constant resolution but different field-of-vision angles. “We started at five degrees and opened up the field all the way to 45 degrees. We found that the saturation point is 35 degrees — the object remains stable beyond that point,” says Ghezzi. All these experiments demonstrated that the system’s capacity doesn’t need to be improved any further, and that it’s ready for clinical trials. But the team will have to wait a little longer before their technology can be implanted in actual patients. For now, restoring vision remains in the realm of science fiction.Reference: 5 March 2021, Communication Materials.

9,Facebook reportedly under probe for ‘systemic’ racial bias in hiring and promotions,Social Media,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316892/facebook-eeoc-systemic-racial-bias-hiring-promotions,"Filed under:A Black Facebook employee had filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging discriminationThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is looking into allegations of racial bias and hiring practices at Facebook, a probe which the agency has designated as “systemic,” Reuters reported. In July, Facebook employee Oscar Veneszee, Jr., who is Black, filed a complaint with the EEOC along with two people Veneszee recruited but whom Facebook did not hire. The complaint alleges that the social platform discriminates against Black job applicants and employees  and promotes racial stereotypes. Veneszee told NPR that Facebook has “a Black people problem,” and that the company has failed to create a culture to attract and retain Black workers. The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook, Reuters notes, and the agency’s investigation may not produce findings of any wrongdoing on the company’s part. Designating the probe as “systemic” suggests the EEOC may suspect Facebook’s hiring policies are contributing to widespread discrimination, and such a designation could pave the way for a possible class action lawsuit, according to Reuters. The EEOC did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge on Saturday.The complaint is reminiscent of earlier criticisms of Facebook’s diversity. In 2018, Facebook’s then-partnerships manager Mark Luckie published an internal memo sent to his co-workers on his last day at the company, where he said the company mistreated its Black employees. “In some buildings, there are more ‘Black Lives Matter’ posters than there are actual black people,” Luckie wrote. “Facebook can’t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren’t represented proportionately in its staffing.”Facebook’s 2020 diversity report showed the company was still short of its goal to have 50 percent of its workforce from underrepresented groups by 2024; that figure inched up from 43 percent in 2019 to 45.3 percent in 2020. Last June, Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout over the company’s decision not to take action against posts from former President Trump, including a post that included the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” seen as a threat toward people protesting racial violence across the country last summer. “We believe it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to The Verge on Saturday. “We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case.”Update March 6th 1:52PM ET: Added comment from Facebook spokespersonA newsletter about computers"
10,YouTube let the March 4 QAnon conspiracy theory spread,Social Media,https://www.mediamatters.org/google/youtube-let-march-4-qanon-conspiracy-theory-spread,"YouTube made money from a QAnon conspiracy theory about a second Trump inauguration and let videos pushing the false claims rack up hundreds of thousands of viewsWritten by Alex Kaplan

ShareCommentYouTube has allowed videos pushing a false QAnon conspiracy theory that former President Donald Trump would be inaugurated as president again on March 4 to earn hundreds of thousands of combined views on the platform. Some of those videos have ads, meaning they provide revenue for both their creators and YouTube.QAnon is a false conspiracy theory that a supposed government insider calling themself “Q” had secret knowledge of a plan involving Trump fighting an elite pedophile ring and bringing on mass arrests. It has been tied to multiple violent incidents, leading several government agencies to issue internal warnings of domestic terrorism about QAnon. QAnon adherents also helped spark and took part in the January 6 insurrection.Last October, YouTube announced a crackdown on QAnon content as part of its “efforts to curb hate and harassment by removing more conspiracy theory content used to justify real-world violence.”However, a Media Matters review using the tracking tool BuzzSumo found well over 300,000 combined views for videos pushing a QAnon conspiracy theory that spread in response to Trump losing reelection to President Joe Biden: the false claim that Trump would become the 19th president on March 4. Believers say all presidents and constitutional amendments (including the 20th Amendment, which moved Inauguration Day from March 4 to January 20) that came after Ulysses S. Grant are invalid because the United States turned from a country into a corporation in the 1870s. That conspiracy theory is part of the reason thousands of National Guard troops remain in Washington, D.C., and law enforcement agencies in the capital are still on high alert due to the claims.One video, with more than 180,000 views, is titled “TRUMP'S INAUGURATION IS ON MARCH 4TH!?! (And BIG PROOF That Trump Controls The Military!!!) Ep. 27.” Its description claims the video provides “perfect proof that Donald Trump Passed a law that gives him the power to control the military until March 20th” and “evidence that Trump will be inaugurated in March.” The video has ads, meaning both YouTube and the account made money from the conspiracy theory. Another video from that same account also has ads and describes how the United States had “switch[ed] from being a Corporation into a country,” and it mentions March 4.Another video that has ads, with more than 10,000 views, is titled “THE CLUES OF WE'RE SEEING THE 19TH PRESIDENT AND BIDEN WAS ARRESTED BEHIND THE SCENE.”Another video, with more than 50,000 views, features a woman claiming that Trump had been “secretly inaugurated on January 11 in a secret ceremony” and would be “publicly inaugurated [on] what appears to be March 4 or around March 4.”Another group of videos, with more than 20,000 combined views, features a woman saying that Trump “will take office as the 19th president of the United States on March 4 under the restored republic.”

From a January 17, 2021, YouTube video
Other YouTube videos with thousands of views spreading the March 4 conspiracy theory include one claiming Trump gave a “State of the Union” speech at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and declaring that he is the “the 19th President of the Republic,” and multiple videos discussing the “19th president.” Additionally, a video with nearly 25,000 views that falsely claims Trump still rides on Air Force One alludes to the conspiracy theory by including a “#March4” hashtag as part of the video’s description.The spread and monetization of the conspiracy theory on YouTube, besides undermining the platform’s QAnon crackdown, is yet another incident in YouTube’s ongoing monetization crisis. The platform has repeatedly allowed channels to monetize videos that violate the platform’s own rules, along with allowing ads to run on videos pushing misinformation in general.

11,"Texas grid operator made $16 billion price error during winter storm, watchdog says",Energy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-texas-ercot-power-idUSKBN2AX0SV,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Kanishka Singh2 Min Read(Reuters) - Power grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) made a $16 billion pricing error in the week of the winter storm that led to power outages across Texas, Potomac Economics, which monitors the state’s power market, said.ERCOT kept market prices for power too high for more than a day after widespread outages ended late on Feb. 17, Potomac Economics, the independent market monitor for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which oversees ERCOT, said in a filing.“In order to comply with the Commission Order, the pricing intervention that raised prices to VOLL (value of lost load) should have ended immediately at that time (late on Feb. 17),” Potomac Economics said.“However, ERCOT continued to hold prices at VOLL by inflating the Real-Time On-Line Reliability Deployment Price Adder for an additional 32 hours through the morning of February 19,” it said, adding the decision resulted in $16 billion in additional costs to ERCOT’s markets.The findings of Potomac Economics were reported first Thursday by Bloomberg and the Texas Tribune.The Public Utility Commission, the Texas power regulator, on Friday unanimously vetoed a request to cut about $16 billion from state power charges during the final day of the February cold snap, saying even a partial repricing could have unintended effects.Separately, rating agency Moody’s Investors Service downgraded ERCOT by one notch to A1 from Aa3 and revised the grid operator’s credit outlook to “negative” on Thursday.On Wednesday, ERCOT’s board ousted chief executive Bill Magness, as the fallout continued from a blackout that left residents without heat, power or water for days.The mid-February storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state’s generating plants, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushed power prices to 10 times the normal rate.Many of ERCOT’s directors have resigned in the last week, and the head of the Public Utility Commission resigned on Monday.Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Barbara Lewis and Leslie AdlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

12,All new vehicles would be electric by 2035 under Ontario NDP’s climate-change plan,Transportation,https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2021/03/06/all-new-vehicles-would-be-electric-by-2035-under-ontario-ndps-climate-change-plan.html,"Sign InSign InThe Star EditionCHANGE LOCATION This copy is for your personal non-commercial use only.

Caps are lowered over time to curb emissions, creating an economic incentive to cut pollution.While Ford scrapped subsidies of up to $14,000 for electric cars, which sent sales plummeting, Horwath said the NDP would set targets for zero-emission vehicles sales of 15 per cent by 2025, 45 per cent by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2035.Mindful of the previous Liberal government’s public-relations problems when taxpayers subsidized six-figure electric Porsches and Teslas, the New Democrats’ “strong incentives” would exclude “luxury vehicles.”Households would be given $600 to install electric vehicle charging stations and the building code would again require new homes to have built-in chargers, a requirement the Tories cancelled in 2019.As well, the NDP would aim at “completely electrifying government fleets by 2030” and work with municipal transit systems to electrify buses and trains by 2040, including the replacement of GO Transit’s diesel rolling stock.“The climate crisis is the greatest threat our world faces, but it’s also an incredible opportunity ... to shift to a more sustainable job-rich and just economy,” said HorwathThe New Democrats would revive the independent environment watchdog Ford controversially merged into the auditor general’s office two years ago in a cost-cutting exercise.“We will restore the full and independent powers of the environmental commissioner, and empower them with clear oversight powers over the cap-and-trade program and its revenues, to keep us on track in our goal to achieve our emission reduction targets,” the party manifesto said.The party would also undo Ford’s much-criticized decision to axe an initiative to plant 50 million trees and aim toward planting one billion trees by 2030.“Planting trees is one of the most cost-effective ways to sequester carbon. This project alone could remove and sequester a significant amount of carbon, helping Ontario achieve our net-zero targets,” the party said.In a bid to create jobs and save electricity and fossil fuels, the NDP would retrofit at least five per cent of Ontario buildings each year, claiming “every $1 invested in energy conservation generates $4 in economic activity.”“By investing in retrofits, between 2022 and 2030 Ontario could see more than $15.2 billion added to our annual (gross domestic product), which should create about 100,000 good jobs.”Horwath’s party would establish a new Youth Climate Corps to “give young Ontarians the opportunity to get hands-on experience restoring and enhancing Ontario’s natural landscape, while gaining knowledge, skills, a fair wage, and a fee credit towards post-secondary education.”The teens would conscripted to help “rehabilitate our wetlands, forests and vegetation.”By releasing planks of their campaign platform more than a year before the election, the New Democrats are following the successful strategy of former premiers Mike Harris and Dalton McGuinty.Harris’s Tories launched their tax-cutting Common Sense Revolution in 1994 while McGuinty’s Liberals unveiled their cornerstone education platform in 2002.In both instances, those opposition parties had time to promote their promises well before election day.While the NDP lags Ford’s Tories in recent public-opinion polls and the Liberals have a new leader in Steven Del Duca, Horwath’s party is optimistic its policies will be popular with progressives.While some environmentally conscientious voters have defected to Mike Schreiner’s Greens in recent elections, the New Democrats believe they can shore up support there with an aggressive climate plan.Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

13,Utah Legislature Passes Bill to Require Cell Phone Manufacturers to Install Pornography Filters,Politics,https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/utah-legislature-passes-bill-to-require-cell-phone-manufacturers-to-install-pornography-filters/,"How to Watch Live Coverage of Murder Trial over Death of George FloydThe Utah House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill that would require cell phones and tablets sold in the Beehive State to contain filters to block pornographic material from reaching a user’s eyes. The bill had previously been approved by the state senate.The measure, HB72, applies to “smart phones activated in the state on or after January 1 of the year following the year this bill takes effect.” However, it doesn’t truly kick in until five other states pass similar measures.The bill would require any phone “activated in the state” to “automatically enable a filter capable of blocking material that is harmful to minors.” The filter would “prevent the user of the device from accessing material that is harmful to minors on the device; enable certain users to deactivate the filter for the device or for specific content; and notify the user when content is filtered.”It also provides a cause of action “for the attorney general or a member of the public” to sue manufacturers who sell devices which do not contain the contemplated filter. Such lawsuits could be brought, the bill says, when “a minor accesse[s] material that is harmful to minors on the device.”The proposed penalty, “up to $10 for each violation,” would be partially payable to the state’s Crime Victims Reparations Fund. A plaintiff could also obtain actual damages — a move which would in essence force litigators to calculate the dollar amount of the harm caused when someone unwillingly sees a pornographic image. The bill explicitly allows class action lawsuits against technology manufacturers.Penalties would be assessed after a court examines the following:(a) the nature and extent of the violation;
(b) the number and severity of the violations;
(c) the economic effect of the penalty on the violator;
(d) the good faith measures the violator took to comply with this part;
(e) the timing of the measures the violator took to comply with this part;
(f) the willfulness of the violator’s misconduct;
(g) the deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole; and
(h) any other factor that the court determines justice requires.The bill’s authors seem to recognize that technology is not perfect. Any manufacturer who makes a “good faith effort” to provide the contemplated filtering technology would get a pass in court if an offensive image slips through the cracks.The bill, as the Salt Lake Tribune pointed out, will potentially run into constitutional challenges.“Even proponents of the measure . . . conceded that the bill is imperfect,” the newspaper said.In 2016, Utah’s legislature declared pornography a “public health crisis.”Sen. Jake Anderegg told the paper that the bill “logistically . . . just won’t work” because it forces manufacturers to turn on the contemplated software.  Manufacturers are not sellers; sellers generally handle software matters before handing phones over to consumers, he pointed out.Still, Anderegg voted in favor of the bill, despite his concerns, because he said he didn’t “want to be the guy” to stand against the bill’s moral stance.Sen. Kathleen Riebe said she was concerned the bill would cause an “undue burden” on interstate commerce, the paper reported.Industry groups lobbied against the measure, the website XBIZ, which describes itself as “the world’s leading source for adult industry news and information,” reported recently.XBIZ noted that Rep. Susan Pulsipher, “a realtor with no technology experience,” sponsored the bill. Sen. Wayne Harper introduced the measure; XBIZ described him as a “staunch anti-porn crusader.”The ACLU of Utah is against the measure.A new version of #HB72 ""Device Filter Amendments"" has all the same constitutional problems as the first bill.It gets another hearing Thursday at 8AM – @siliconslopes@sjquinney @LibertasUtah @RobertGehrke @ELI_Utah Follow it here: https://t.co/Xp049hpJwo pic.twitter.com/ta8uQLNKKE— ACLU of Utah (@acluutah) February 11, 2021The bill now awaits action from the governor, Spencer Cox (R).[Photo by George Frey/Getty Image]Have a tip we should know?

14,"You got a vaccine. Walgreens got your data. Retail pharmacies are now giving out Covid-19 vaccines, and some of them are using it as an opportunity to profit off your information.",Privacy,https://www.vox.com/recode/22310281/covid-vaccine-walgreens-cvs-rite-aid-walmart-data,"Retail pharmacies are now giving out Covid-19 vaccines, and some of them are using it as an opportunity to profit off your information.
    Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us.
  I became eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine on February 15. Hoping to get an edge on the millions of other newly eligible New Yorkers I’d be competing with for an appointment, I spent a few days before the big day figuring out how and where to sign up for a vaccine between the many portals for my state, my city, health care providers, and retail pharmacies that were distributing them.And that’s when I noticed something about Walgreens:love to give my personal data to Walgreens in order to get a potentially life-saving vaccine (and 1% off all in-store purchases!) pic.twitter.com/7XYU5KDN3uLast November, the Trump administration announced a partnership with retail pharmacies to distribute coronavirus vaccines, which would provide people across the country with more places to get vaccines and people to administer them. That’s a good thing. The other side of it is, as the Wall Street Journal reported this week, some pharmacies are taking advantage of the program to make some extra money off of their new customers. If you schedule a Covid-19 vaccine appointment with major pharmacy chains such as Walgreens or CVS, your data may be used to bulk up those companies’ own significant marketing apparatuses, giving them a source of income even beyond what they’re paid for administering the vaccines and whatever you might decide to buy while you’re in the store to get one. In some cases, you’re forced to make an account with the store to get a vaccine at all, and deactivating your mandatory account after the fact isn’t easy. “To schedule vaccination appointments, we ask people to create a Walgreens account to fulfill data and reporting requirements online before arriving at a store location,” a Walgreens spokesperson told Recode. “This enables a safer and more streamlined in-store experience — reducing lines and in-store wait times that can be a by-product of collecting this information at the pharmacy counter.”Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s unprecedented burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.When you go to the Walgreens vaccine scheduler, you can find out if there are vaccines available in your area, but you can’t see where and when appointments are available — let alone schedule one — without first making a Walgreens account. And that means giving Walgreens the information it considers necessary to make that account, including your name, date of birth, phone number, address, gender (male or female are the only options), and email address. You’re also automatically signing up to receive marketing emails, which you can only opt out of later through your account settings. Oh, and you’re encouraged to join the myWalgreens loyalty program, which gives Walgreens even more data about your purchases and automatically signs you up for even more marketing emails. This doesn’t apply to all the data you provide: Any information you give for the purposes of getting a vaccine at a pharmacy is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).But the data that isn’t protected can be valuable to the retail pharmacies you give it to. Walgreens, for instance, will use your data to target ads to you on its website, on social media, and in marketing emails — as detailed in Walgreens’ own privacy policy:Walgreens makes it easy to sign up for all of this, and it’s particularly aggressive when it comes to data demands in general. For instance, it now forces customers to provide a valid email address to enroll in its myWalgreens loyalty program, which tracks all purchases made using your myWalgreens card. By the way, Walgreens also recently announced its Walgreens Advertising Group, a “modern, full-service, personalization-driven advertising offering rooted in insights and rich first-party data” advertisers can use to target ads to you. The source of that “rich first-party data”? That’d be the loyalty program.What’s not so easy is deactivating your Walgreens account if you so choose after you’ve gotten your vaccine. In fact, you can’t even do it online. You have to call Walgreens customer service at 1-877-250-5823.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Recode that its agreement with participating pharmacies asks them to use an online scheduling system for vaccine appointments for social distancing purposes, and it lets pharmacies use their own. So Walgreens used its existing system, which requires patients to make an account. Walmart did the same, though it at least offers patients the ability to opt out of receiving marketing emails when they register, and doesn’t require anything beyond a name and email to create the account.As was the case with Walgreens, getting rid of your Walmart account once you no longer need it is a more onerous process than creating it. In its instructions for how to close your account, Walmart simply says to “contact our Customer Care team for assistance” without providing instructions on how to do that. But if you scroll down the page a bit, you’ll see a “contact us” button. Click that, and tell the chatbot that will pop up that you want to deactivate your account, and then pick your preferred method of contact (online chat, phone, or email). This will take several minutes, but your account will be deactivated.Rite Aid and CVS, who, along with Walgreens and Walmart, get the majority of the vaccines distributed through the program, told Recode that they don’t require patients to sign up for an account to get a vaccine, but neither responded to follow-up questions about if they collect data from patients for non-vaccine purposes, how it might be used, and if there’s a way to opt out of data collection or delete whatever data has already been collected. CVS did tell the Wall Street Journal that it would “stay in touch” with customers after they received their second shot and hoped to market products to them. The company also said it would encourage patients to join CVS’s loyalty program while they were at their vaccine appointments. Similar to Walgreens, CVS has an advertising arm, announced last August, which relies on data collected through its loyalty program.Recode also reached out to several other companies that the federal government has partnered with to provide vaccines, including Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, and Publix, for comment on if and how they were collecting data on their patients. Costco was the only one to respond, saying that it appreciated my “interest and support” and had no comment. All that said: Get the vaccine. Yes, you might have to sign up for a store account first and that’s not ideal. Yes, it would be nice if the government had put some restrictions in place so retail pharmacies weren’t allowed to collect and use your data in this way. And yes, some pharmacies are taking advantage of a terrible situation to profit off of you, because most businesses will do absolutely everything they can to make money and your data is valuable. But your life and your health are even more valuable — even if you have to make some privacy compromises to preserve them.Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

A new type of supply chain attack unveiled last month is targeting more and more companies, with new rounds this week taking aim at Microsoft, Amazon, Slack, Lyft, Zillow, and an unknown number of others. In weeks past, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and 32 other companies were targeted by a similar attack that allowed a security researcher to execute unauthorized code inside their networks.The latest attack against Microsoft was also carried out as a proof-of-concept by a researcher. Attacks targeting Amazon, Slack, Lyft, and Zillow, by contrast, were malicious, but it’s not clear if they succeeded in executing the malware inside their networks. The npm and PyPi open source code repositories, meanwhile, have been flooded with more than 5,000 proof-of-concept packages, according to Sonatype, a firm that helps customers secure the applications they develop.“Given the daily volume of suspicious npm packages being picked up by Sonatype’s automated malware detection systems, we only expect this trend to increase, with adversaries abusing dependency confusion to conduct even more sinister activities,” Sonatype researcher Ax Sharma wrote earlier this week.Developers’ software management apps often favor external code libraries over internal ones, so they download and use the malicious package rather than the trusted one. Alex Birsan—the researcher who tricked Apple and the other 34 companies into running the proof-of-concept packages he uploaded to npm and PyPi—dubbed the new type of supply chain attack dependency confusion or namespace confusion because it relies of software dependencies with misleading names.Software dependencies are code libraries that an application must incorporate for it to work. Normally, developers closely guard the names of dependencies inside their software build systems. But Birsan found that the names often leak when package.json files—which hold various metadata relevant to a development project—are embedded into public script files. Internal paths and public scripts that contain the require() programming call can also leak dependency names.In the event the file with the same name isn’t available in a public repository, hackers can upload a malicious package and give it the same file name and a version number that’s higher than the authentic file stored internally. In many cases, developers either accidentally use the malicious library, or their build application automatically does so.“It’s a slick attack,” HD Moore, co-founder and CEO of network discovery platform Rumble, said. “My guess is it affects a ton of folks.” He added that most at risk are organizations that use large numbers of internal packages and don’t take special steps to prevent public packages from replacing internal ones.In the weeks since Birsan published his findings, dependency confusion attacks have flourished. Already hit by a proof-of-concept attack that executed Birsan’s unauthorized package in its network, Microsoft recently fell to a second attack, which was done by researchers from firm Contrast Security.Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast, said he started by looking for dependencies used in Microsoft’s Teams desktop application. After finding a JavaScript package called “Optional Dependencies,” he seized on a way to get a Teams development machine to download and run a package he put on npm. The package used the same name as a module listed as an optional dependency.Shortly after doing so, a script Austin put into the module started contacting him from several internal Microsoft IP addresses. Austin wrote:Whether the responses I saw were automated or manual, the fact that I was able to generate this reaction poses significant risk. By taking advantage of the post-install script, I was able to execute code in whatever environment this was being installed on. If attackers were to execute code the way I did on a build server for a desktop application update that was about to be distributed, they could insert anything they wanted into that update, and that code would go out to every desktop using Teams—more than 115 million machines. Such an attack could have monumental repercussions, potentially affecting as many organizations as the massive attack on the SolarWinds software factory that was revealed in December.He provided the following figure illustrating how a malicious attack might work under this theoretical scenario:A Microsoft spokeswoman wrote: “As part of our larger efforts to mitigate package substitution attacks, we quickly identified the issue mentioned and addressed it, and at no point did it pose a serious security risk to our customers.” The spokeswoman added that the system that executed Austin’s code was part of the company’s security testing infrastructure. Microsoft has more about the risks and ways to mitigate them here.Like the packages uploaded by Birsan and Austin, the thousands of files that flooded npm and PyPi have mostly contained benign scripts that send the researchers the IP address and other generic details of the computer that runs them.But not all of the uploads have observed such restraint. On Monday, Sonatype researchers reported files uploaded to npm that attempted to steal password hashes and bash script histories from companies including Amazon, Slack, Lyft, and Zillow.“These activities would take place as soon as a dependency confusion attack succeeds and would need no action from the victim, given the nature of the dependency/namespace hijacking issue,” Sharma, the researcher at Sonatype, wrote.Bash histories, which store commands and other input that administrators type into their computers, often contain plaintext passwords and other sensitive data. Files stored in the /etc/shadow path of Linux machines store the cryptographic hashes of passwords needed to access user accounts on the computer. (For hashes to be compromised, the npm app would have to be running in super user mode, an extremely elevated set of privileges that are almost never given to software management apps.)Sonatype said it had no way of knowing whether the files were executed by any of the companies targeted by the scripts.In a statement, Slack officials wrote:The mimicked library in question is not part of Slack’s product, nor is it maintained or supported by Slack. We have no reason to believe the malicious software was executed in production. Our security team regularly scans the dependencies used in our product with internal and external tools to prevent attacks of this nature. Additionally, Slack’s secure development practices, such as using a private scope when using private dependencies, make it unlikely that a dependency-related attack would be successful against our product.A Lyft statement read: “Lyft was not harmed in this attempt. There is no indication that this malicious software was executed on Lyft’s network. Lyft has a dedicated information security program to defend against such supply chain attacks and runs an active bug bounty program to continuously test its security controls.”Zillow officials wrote:We are aware of the recent security report involving a possible attack involving spoofed software packages. After an investigation by our security team, we found no evidence that our systems were compromised or exploited by the disclosed technique. Our team is also taking a number of actions to monitor and defend against any future possible attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems.Representatives from npm, meanwhile, wrote: “We’ve provided guidance on how to best protect against these types of substitution attacks in this blog post. We’re committed to keeping npm secure and continuing to improve the security of the ecosystem.”Amazon representatives didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. A representative for PyPi didn’t immediately have a comment.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

18,Reddit hires its first chief financial officer as it prepares for an I.P.O.,Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/reddit-chief-financial-officer-ipo.html,"AdvertisementBy Mike IsaacThe world’s most popular internet message board is thinking about going public.Reddit, the social network and online bulletin, said on Thursday that it had appointed its first chief financial officer, Drew Vollero, in a move toward tidying up the company’s books before an eventual public offering of its stock.Mr. Vollero, 55, previously ran financial operations for Mattel, Snap and Allied Universal. His task at Reddit will be building out the financial, audit and accounting functions and leading the company through the process of going public.“Is Reddit going public?” Steve Huffman, Reddit’s chief executive, said in an interview. “We’re thinking about it. We’re working toward that moment.”Mr. Huffman said Reddit did not have a timeline, but Mr. Vollero’s appointment indicated that the 15-year-old company was developing its financial operations to be more similar to those of publicly traded peers like Twitter and Facebook. More than 52 million people visit Reddit every day, and it is home to more than 100,000 topic-based communities, or subforums.For years, Reddit represented a kind of return to the message board era of the internet, where people gathered to discuss topics as varied as makeup and video games. It dabbled in different models and occasionally generated controversy, such as over its role in easing online bullying and the spread of hateful content.Mr. Huffman, one of Reddit’s co-founders, returned to run the site in 2015. He has changed many parts of the business, working to rein in hate speech and digital abuse and developing the company’s advertising and direct-to-consumer product business. Reddit has revamped its terms of service to outlaw the noxious content that filled some of its subforums in its earlier days.Reddit has also added to its executive ranks in recent months, hiring a head of security and appointing a new member to its board. In December, the company acquired Dubsmash, a video-focused social app that competes with TikTok. Last month, Reddit raised $250 million in new capital, its largest venture round, valuing the company at $6 billion.Reddit plans to use the funding to expand its business, including its financial team, Mr. Huffman said. He also wants to make Reddit more mainstream by improving the product or making other investments, he said.“Reddit can be hard to get at first,” Mr. Huffman said. “It takes a little time. We want to shorten that time.”Advertisement"
19,Farmers Ask For 'Right To Repair' - Farmers Advocates Say John Deere And Other Equipment Manufacturers Have Monopoly On Repairs.,Hardware,https://www.dailyherald.com/business/20210303/farmers-ask-for-right-to-repair,"
Farmers advocates say John Deere and other equipment manufacturers have monopoly on repairs.
		Associated Press file photo
SPRINGFIELD -- Legislation backed by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group would require farming equipment manufacturers to make software required for repairs available to consumers for purchase.House Bill 3061, introduced as the ""Digital Right to Repair Act"" in February by Democratic Rep. Michelle Mussman of Schaumburg, would mandate that manufacturers, by 2022, provide farmers with the same diagnostic materials available to official repair providers. It would also require the manufacturers to make parts necessary for repair, including software, available for purchase.The legislation comes after the release of a report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group that alleges farmers are unable to sufficiently repair tractors purchased from John Deere and other manufacturers because they withhold the software necessary to do so.""The Association of Equipment Manufacturers, of which John Deere is a prominent member, promised that by 2021, they would give farmers the necessary tools to fix their machinery. However, Deere has fallen short of that commitment, so farmers -- and all Americans, who rely on them to produce food -- are worse off,"" advocate Kevin O'Reilly said in a release announcing the report.The report says for countless generations farmers have been able to independently repair equipment once purchased from manufacturers, but new developments in technology have shifted the status quo to disadvantage farmers. Unable to make repairs themselves, farmers are required to take equipment back to the dealership or associated repair facilities, ""leading to delays of hours to weeks.""""Without the software tools needed to diagnose problems, install replacement parts and authorize repairs, the engagement or failure of any sensor or control system forces a farmer to either haul their machine into the nearest dealership or wait for a field technician to arrive to complete the repair,"" the report reads.The report also claims that sensors and controller networks, which have become necessary for tractors and combine harvesters to function, are the highest points of failure on farming machinery as opposed to hardware damage that can be fixed by the farmer.According to U.S. PIRG, this is intentional to give manufacturers a repair monopoly. Their evidence is the lucrative nature of the repair industry. From 2013 to 2019, John Deere's annual sales of parts rose to $6.7 billion, a 22% increase, while its annual sales of equipment fell by 19% to $23.7 billion.Manufacturers have opposed providing the software on several grounds. They say it could jeopardize proprietary information and lead to the theft of trade secrets tied to programming. Giving farmers access to repair software could also allow them to make illegal modifications to their equipment, potentially leading to some farmers overriding safety and environmental controls placed in the vehicle software.The Digital Right to Repair Act, which awaits assignment to a substantial committee in the House, includes a provision that prevents the legislation from being made ""to require an original equipment manufacturer to divulge a trade secret ... except as necessary to provide documentation, parts, and tools on fair and reasonable terms.""Farming groups have increased their pressure on manufacturers to concede the right to repair, using the threat of legislation to reach an agreement.According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the American Farm Bureau Federation voted in 2020 to throw its weight behind right-to-repair legislation if manufacturers didn't reach an agreement with farmers and independent repair contractors by 2021.Twenty other states are considering bills mandating the right to repair."

21,White House says Microsoft email hackers have 'large number of victims',Politics,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-microsoft-idUSKBN2AX23U?utm_source=34553&amp;utm_medium=partner,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Joseph Menn, Raphael Satter, Trevor Hunnicutt4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 20,000 U.S. organizations have been compromised through a back door installed via recently patched flaws in Microsoft Corp’s email software, a person familiar with the U.S. government’s response said on Friday.The hacking has already reached more places than all of the tainted code downloaded from SolarWinds Corp, the company at the heart of another massive hacking spree uncovered in December.The latest hack has left channels for remote access spread among credit unions, town governments and small businesses, according to records from the U.S. investigation.Tens of thousands of organizations in Asia and Europe are also affected, the records show.The hacks are continuing despite emergency patches issued by Microsoft on Tuesday.Microsoft, which had initially said the hacks consisted of “limited and targeted attacks,” declined to comment on the scale of the problem on Friday but said it was working with government agencies and security companies to provide help to customers.It added, “impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.”One scan of connected devices showed only 10% of those vulnerable had installed the patches by Friday, though the number was rising.Because installing the patch does not get rid of the back doors, U.S. officials are racing to figure out how to notify all the victims and guide them in their hunt.All of those affected appear to run Web versions of email client Outlook and host them on their own machines, instead of relying on cloud providers. That may have spared many of the biggest companies and federal government agencies, the records suggest.The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.Microsoft and the person working with the U.S. response blamed the initial wave of attacks on a Chinese government-backed actor. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions.What started as a controlled attack late last year against a few classic espionage targets grew last month to a widespread campaign. Security officials said that implied that unless China had changed tactics, a second group may have become involved.More attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.The hackers have only used the back doors to re-enter and move around the infected networks in a small percentage of cases, probably less than 1 in 10, the person working with the government said.“A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can,” stealing data and installing other ways to return later, he said.The initial avenue of attack was discovered by prominent Taiwanese cyber researcher Cheng-Da Tsai, who said he reported the flaw to Microsoft in January. He said in a blog post that he was investigating whether the information leaked.He did not respond to requests for further comment.Reporting by Raphael Satter and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Rosalba O’BrienOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

22,Digital colonialism: the evolution of American empire,Society,https://roarmag.org/essays/digital-colonialism-the-evolution-of-american-empire/,"ROAR Magazine is an independent journal of the radical imagination providing grassroots perspectives from the frontlines of the global struggle for real democracy. Username  Password Lost Password? Remember Me  American “Big Tech” corporations are gaining massive profits through their control over business, labor, social media and entertainment in the Global South.This essay is part of the Digital Futures series ROAR is producing in collaboration with the Transnational Institute.Illustration by Zoran SvilarIFor the bourgeoisie presiding over “Big Tech” corporations, life is grand.Yet, while the expanded dominance of these corporations in their domestic markets is the subject of numerous critical analyses, their global reach is a fact seldom discussed, especially by dominant intellectuals in the American empire.In fact, once we investigate the mechanics and numbers, it becomes apparent that Big Tech is not only global in scope, it is fundamentally colonial in character and dominated by the United States. This phenomenon is called “digital colonialism.”We live in a world where digital colonialism now risks becoming as significant and far-reaching a threat to the Global South as classic colonialism was in previous centuries. Sharp increases in inequality, the rise of state-corporate surveillance and sophisticated police and military technologies are just a few of the consequences of this new world order. The phenomenon may sound new to some, but over the course of the past decades, it has become entrenched in the global status quo. Without a considerably strong counter-power movement, the situation will get much worse.Digital colonialism is the use of digital technology for political, economic and social domination of another nation or territory.Under classic colonialism, Europeans seized and settled foreign land; installed infrastructure like military forts, sea ports and railways; deployed gunboats for economic penetration and military conquest; constructed heavy machinery and exploited labor to extract raw materials; erected panoptic structures to police workers; marshaled the engineers needed for advanced economic exploitation (e.g. chemists for extracting minerals); siphoned out Indigenous knowledge for manufacturing processes; shipped the raw materials back to the mother country for the production of manufactured goods; undermined Global South markets with cheap manufactured goods; perpetuated dependency of peoples and nations in the Global South in an unequal global division of labor; and expanded market, diplomatic and military domination for profit and plunder.In other words, colonialism depended upon ownership and control of territory and infrastructure, the extraction of labor, knowledge and commodities and the exercise of state power.This process evolved over centuries, with new technologies added into the mix as they were developed. By the late nineteenth century, submarine cables facilitated telegraphic communications in service of the British empire. New developments in recording, archiving and organizing information were exploited by US military intelligence first used in the conquest of the Philippines.Today, Eduardo Galeano’s “open veins” of the Global South are the “digital veins” crossing the oceans, wiring up a tech ecosystem owned and controlled by a handful of mostly US-based corporations. Some of the transoceanic fiber-optic cables are fitted with strands owned or leased by the likes of Google and Facebook to further their data extraction and monopolization. Today’s heavy machinery are the cloud server farms dominated by Amazon and Microsoft that are used to store, pool and process big data, proliferating like military bases for US empire. The engineers are the corporate armies of elite programmers with generous salaries of $250,000 or more. The exploited laborers are the people of color extracting the minerals in the Congo and Latin America, the armies of cheap labor annotating artificial intelligence data in China and Africa and the Asian workers suffering from PTSD after cleansing social media platforms of disturbing content. The platforms and spy centers (like the NSA) are the panopticons, and data is the raw material processed for artificial intelligence-based services.More broadly, digital colonialism is about entrenching an unequal division of labor, where the dominant powers have used their ownership of digital infrastructure, knowledge and their control of the means of computation to keep the South in a situation of permanent dependency. This unequal division of labor has evolved. Economically, manufacturing has moved down the hierarchy of value, displaced by an advanced high-tech economy in which the Big Tech firms are firmly in charge.Digital colonialism is rooted in the domination of the “stuff” of the digital world that forms the means of computation — software, hardware and network connectivity.Illustration by Zoran SvilarIt includes the platforms acting as gatekeepers, the data extracted by intermediary service providers and the industry standards, as well as private ownership of “intellectual property” and “digital intelligence.” Digital colonialism has become highly integrated with conventional tools of capitalism and authoritarian governance, from labor exploitation, policy capture and economic planning to intelligence services, ruling class hegemony and propaganda.Looking first at software, we can see a process where code which was once freely and widely shared by programmers became increasingly privatized and subject to copyrights. In 1970s and 80s, the US Congress began strengthening software copyrights. There was a counter-trend to this in the form of “Free and Open Source Software” (FOSS) licenses which granted users the right to use, study, modify and share software. This had inherent benefits for countries in the Global South as it created a “digital commons,” free of corporate control and the drive for profit. Yet, as the Free Software movement spread to the South, it prompted a corporate backlash. Microsoft scorned Peru when its government tried to shift away from Microsoft’s proprietary software. It also tried to prevent African governments from using the GNU/Linux FOSS operating system in government ministries and schools.Alongside the privatization of software came the rapid centralization of the Internet into the hands of intermediary service providers like Facebook and Google. Crucially, the shift to cloud services nullified the freedoms FOSS licenses had granted to users because the software is executed on the computers of the Big Tech corporations. Corporate clouds dispossess the people of the ability to control their computers. Cloud services provide petabytes of information to corporations, who use the data to train their artificial intelligence systems. AI uses Big Data to “learn” — it requires millions of pictures to recognize, say, the letter “A” in its different fonts and forms. When applied to humans, the sensitive details of peoples’ personal lives become an incredibly valuable resource that tech giants are incessantly trying to extract.In the South, the majority of the people are essentially stuck with low-level feature phones or smartphones with little data to spare. As a result, many millions of people experience platforms like Facebook as “the internet,” and data about them is consumed by foreign imperialists.“Feedback effects” of Big Data make the situation worse: those who have more and better data can create the best artificial intelligence services, which attracts more users, which gives them even more data to make the service better and so on. Much like classic colonialism, data has been ingested as raw materials for the imperialist powers, who process the data and manufacture the services back to the global public, which further strengthens their domination and puts everyone else in a subordinate situation of dependency.Cecilia Rikap, in her forthcoming book, Capitalism, Power and Innovation: Intellectual Monopoly Capitalism Uncovered, shows how the US tech giants base their market power on their intellectual monopolies, commanding a complex commodity chain of subordinate firms in order to extract rents and exploit labor. This has given them the ability to accumulate the “know-who” and “know-how” to plan and organize global value chains, as well as to privatize knowledge and expropriate the knowledge commons and public research outputs.Apple, for example, extracts rents from the IP and branding for its smartphones, and it coordinates production along the commodity chain. The lower level producers, such as the phone assemblers at manufacturing plants hosted by Taiwan-owned Foxconn, the minerals extracted for the batteries in the Congo and the chipmakers supplying processors, are all subordinate to the demands and whims of Apple.In other words, the tech giants control business relationships across the commodity chain, profiting from their knowledge, accumulated capital and dominance of core functional components. This allows them to bargain down or dispense with even relatively large corporations who mass-produce their products as subordinates. Universities are complicit. The most prestigious ones in the core imperialist countries are the most dominant actors in the academic production space, while the most vulnerable universities in the periphery or semi-periphery are the most exploited, often lacking the funds for research and development, the knowledge or capacity to patent findings and the resources to fight back when their work is expropriated.One example of how digital colonization plays out is in the education sector.As I detail at length in my doctoral dissertation on education technology in South Africa, Microsoft, Google, Pearson, IBM and other tech giants are flexing their muscles in educational systems across the Global South. For Microsoft, this is nothing new. As mentioned above, Microsoft attempted to strongarm African governments to replace Free Software with Microsoft Windows, including in schools.In South Africa, Microsoft has an army of teacher trainers on the ground who train teachers in how to use Microsoft software in the education system. It also provided Windows tablets and Microsoft software to universities such as the University of Venda, a partnership that it advertised extensively. More recently, it partnered with mobile provider Vodacom (majority owned by British multinational Vodafone) to provide digital education to South African learners.While Microsoft is the top supplier, with contracts in at least five of the nine provincial education departments in South Africa, Google is also seeking market share. In partnership with South African startup CloudEd, they are seeking to strike the first Google contract with a provincial department.The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has also joined the mix, offering a Data Driven District (DDD) platform to provincial governments. The DDD software is designed to collect data which tracks and monitors teachers and students, including grades, attendance and “social issues.” While schools upload the collected data weekly rather than in real-time, the ultimate goal is to provide real-time monitoring of student’s behavior and performance for bureaucratic management and “longitudinal data analytics” (analysis of data collected about the same group of individuals over time).The South African government is also expanding Department of Basic Education’s (DBE) Cloud, which may be eventually used for invasive technocratic surveillance. Microsoft approached the DBE with a proposal to collect data “for the lifecycle of the user,” starting from school and, for those who keep Microsoft Office 365 accounts, into adulthood, so that the government can conduct longitudinal analytics on things like the connection between education and employment.The digital colonialism of Big Tech is spreading rapidly throughout education systems in the South. Writing from Brazil, Giselle Ferreira and her co-authors state, “The resemblance between what happens in Brazil and Kwet’s (2019) analysis of the South African case (and likely other countries in the ‘global South’) is striking. In particular, when GAFA [Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple] companies generously offer technologies to disadvantaged students, data is unimpededly extracted and subsequently treated in a manner that renders local specificities devoid of importance.”Schools make great sites for Big Tech to expand their control over digital markets. Poor persons in the South are often reliant upon governments or corporations to provide them with a device at no cost, making them dependent upon others to decide which software they use. What better way to capture market share than to preload Big Tech software on devices offered to children — who may have little other access to tech than a feature phone? This has the added benefit of capturing future software developers, who may come to prefer, say, Google or Microsoft (instead of people’s tech solutions based on Free Software) after spending years using their software and becoming accustomed to their interface and features.Illustration by Zoran SvilarDigital colonialism is also evident in the way the countries across the Global South are heavily exploited for menial labor to provide the critical inputs for digital technologies. It has long been noted that the Democratic Republic of the Congo supplies more than 70 percent of the world’s cobalt, an essential mineral for batteries used in cars, smartphones and computers. Fourteen families in the Democratic Republic are currently suing Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Dell and Microsoft, accusing them of benefiting from child labor in the cobalt mining industry. The process of mining for minerals itself often adversely impacts the health of workers and their surrounding habitats.As for lithium, top reserves are located in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Australia. Wages for workers in all Latin American countries are low by wealthy country’s standards, especially considering the working conditions they endure. While the availability of data varies, in Chile, those employed by the mines earn somewhere between about $1,430 and $3,000 per month, whereas in Argentina monthly wages can be as low as between $300 and $1,800. In 2016, the monthly minimum wage of miners in Bolivia was increased to $250. In contrast, Australian miners earn around $9,000 per month and can reach $200,000 per year.Countries in the South also offer an abundance of cheap labor for tech giants. This includes data annotation for artificial intelligence datasets, call-center workers and content moderators for social media giants like Facebook. Content moderators cleanse social media feeds of disturbing content, such as gore and sexually explicit material, often leaving them psychologically damaged. Yet, a content moderator in a country like India can make as little as $3,500 per year — and that is after a pay increase from $1,400.In the West, there is a lot of chatter about “a new Cold War,” with the US and China battling it out for global technological supremacy. Yet, a close look at the tech ecosystem shows that US corporations are overwhelmingly dominant in the global economy.China, after decades of high growth, generates around 17 percent of global GDP and is predicted to overtake the US by 2028, feeding into claims that American empire is on the decline (a narrative that was previously popular with the rise of Japan). When measuring the Chinese economy by purchasing power parity, it is already larger than the US. However, as economist Sean Starrs points out in the New Left Review, this wrongly treats states as self-contained units, “interacting as billiard balls on a table.” In reality, Starrs contends, American economic dominance “hasn’t declined, it globalized.” This is particularly true when looking at Big Tech.In the post-WWII period, corporate production was spread across transnational production networks. For instance, in the 1990s, companies like Apple began outsourcing electronics manufacturing from the US to China and Taiwan, exploiting sweatshop workers employed by companies like Foxconn. US tech transnationals often design the IP for, say, high-performance router switches (e.g. Cisco) while outsourcing manufacturing capacity to hardware manufacturers in the South.Starrs profiled the world’s top 2,000 publicly traded companies, as ranked by Forbes Global 2000, and organized them according to 25 sectors, showing the dominance of US transnationals. As of 2013, they dominated in terms of profit shares in 18 of the top 25 sectors. In his forthcoming book American Power Globalized: Rethinking National Power in the Age of Globalization, Starrs shows that the US remains dominant. For IT Software & Services, US profit share is 76 percent versus China’s 10 percent; for Technology Hardware & Equipment, it is 63 percent for the US versus 6 percent for China, and for Electronics, it is 43 and 10 percent, respectively. Other countries, such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, often fare better than China in these categories as well.Portraying the US and China as equal contenders in the battle for global tech supremacy, as is often done, is therefore highly misleading. For example, a 2019 United Nations “Digital Economy” report states that: “Geography of the digital economy is highly concentrated in two countries” — the United States and China. But the report not only ignores factors identified by authors like Starrs it also fails to account for the fact that most of China’s tech industry is dominant inside China, save a handful of major products and services, such as 5G (Huawei), CCTV cameras (Hikvision, Dahua) and social media (TikTok), which also hold large market shares abroad. China also has substantial investments in some foreign tech firms, but this hardly suggests a genuine threat to the dominance of the US, which has a much larger share of foreign investments as well.In reality, the US is the supreme tech empire. Outside of US and Chinese borders, the US leads in the categories of search engines (Google); web browsers (Google Chrome, Apple Safari); smartphone and tablet operating systems (Google Android, Apple iOS); desktop and laptop operating systems (Microsoft Windows, macOS); office software (Microsoft Office, Google G Suite, Apple iWork); cloud infrastructure and services (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM); social networking platforms (Facebook, Twitter); transportation (Uber, Lyft); business networking (Microsoft LinkedIn); streaming entertainment (Google, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu) and online advertising (Google, Facebook) — among others.The upshot is, whether you are an individual or a business, if you are using a computer, American companies benefit the most. They own the digital ecosystem.The economic power of US tech giants goes hand-in-hand with their influence in the political and social spheres. As with other industries, there is a revolving door between tech executives and the US government, and tech corporations and business alliances spend a great deal lobbying regulators for policies favorable to their specific interests — and digital capitalism in general.Illustration by Zoran SvilarGovernments and law enforcement agencies, in turn, form partnerships with tech giants to do their dirty work. In 2013, Edward Snowden famously revealed that Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple all shared information with the National Security Agency via the PRISM program. More revelations followed, and the world learned that data stored by corporations and transmitted over the internet is sucked into enormous government databases for exploitation by states. Countries in the South have been targets of NSA surveillance, from the Middle East to Africa and Latin America.Police and the military also work with tech corporations, who are happy to cash fat checks as providers of surveillance products and services, including in countries across the South. For example, through its little-known Public Safety and Justice Division, Microsoft has built an extensive partnership ecosystem with “law enforcement” surveillance vendors, who run their tech on Microsoft cloud infrastructure. This includes a city-wide command-and-control surveillance platform called “Microsoft Aware” that was purchased by police in Brazil and Singapore and a police vehicle solution with facial recognition cameras that has been rolled out in Cape Town and Durban, South Africa.Microsoft is also deeply involved with the prison industry. It offers a variety of prison software solutions that cover the entire correctional pipeline, from juvenile “offenders” to pretrial and probation, through jail and prison, as well as those released from prison and put on parole. In Africa, they partnered with a company called Netopia Solutions, which offers a Prison Management Software (PMS) platform that includes “escape management” and prisoner analytics.While it is not clear where exactly Netopia’s Prison Management Solution is deployed, Microsoft stated that “Netopia is [a Microsoft partner/vendor] in Morocco with a deep focus on transforming digitally, government services in North and Central Africa.” Morocco has a track record of brutalizing dissidents and torturing prisoners, and the US recently recognized its annexation of Western Sahara, in contravention of international law.For centuries, imperial powers tested technologies to police and control their citizens on foreign populations first, from Sir Francis Galton’s pioneering work on fingerprinting applied in India and South Africa, to America’s combination of biometrics and innovations in managing statistics and data management that formed the first modern surveillance apparatus to pacify the Philippines. As historian Alfred McCoy has shown, the collection of surveillance technologies deployed in the Philippines offered a testing ground for a model which was eventually brought back to the United States for use against domestic dissidents. Microsoft and its partners’ high-tech surveillance projects suggest that Africans continue to serve as a laboratory for carceral experimentation.Digital technology and information plays a central role in politics, economy and social life everywhere. As part of the American empire project, US transnational corporations are reinventing colonialism in the South through their ownership and control of intellectual property, digital intelligence and the means of computation. Most of the core infrastructure, industries and functions performed by computers are the private property of American transnational corporations, who are overwhelmingly dominant outside US borders. The largest firms, such as Microsoft and Apple, dominate global supply chains as intellectual monopolies.An unequal exchange and division of labor ensues, reinforcing dependency in the periphery while perpetuating mass immiseration and global poverty.Instead of sharing knowledge, transferring technology and providing the building blocks for shared global prosperity on equal terms, the rich countries and their corporations aim to protect their advantage and shake down the South for cheap labor and rent extraction. By monopolizing the core components of the digital ecosystem, pushing their tech in schools and skills training programs and partnering with corporate and state elites in the South, Big Tech is capturing emerging markets. They will even profit from surveillance services provided to police departments and prisons, all to make a buck.Yet against the forces of concentrated power, there are always those who push back. Resistance to Big Tech in the South has a long history, dating back to the days of international protests against IBM, Hewlett Packard and others doing business in apartheid South Africa. In the early 2000s, Global South countries embraced Free Software and the global commons as a means to resist digital colonialism for a while, even if many of those initiatives have since faded. In the last few years, new movements against digital colonialism are emerging.There is much more going in this picture. An ecological crisis created by capitalism is rapidly threatening to permanently destroy life on Earth, and solutions for the digital economy must intersect with environmental justice and broader struggles for equality.To stamp out digital colonialism, we need a different conceptual framework that challenge root causes and major actors, in connection with grassroots movements willing to confront capitalism and authoritarianism, American empire, and its intellectual supporters.The latest content in your inbox.Help ROAR cultivate the radical imagination.Michael Kwet received his PhD in Sociology from Rhodes University and is a Visiting Fellow of the Information Society Project at Yale Law School.

23,"At Least 30,000 U.S. Organizations Newly Hacked Via Holes in Microsoft’s Email Software",Security,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/,"At least 30,000 organizations across the United States — including a significant number of small businesses, towns, cities and local governments — have over the past few days been hacked by an unusually aggressive Chinese cyber espionage unit that’s focused on stealing email from victim organizations, multiple sources tell KrebsOnSecurity. The espionage group is exploiting four newly-discovered flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server email software, and has seeded hundreds of thousands of victim organizations worldwide with tools that give the attackers total, remote control over affected systems.On March 2, Microsoft released emergency security updates to plug four security holes in Exchange Server versions 2013 through 2019 that hackers were actively using to siphon email communications from Internet-facing systems running Exchange.In the three days since then, security experts say the same Chinese cyber espionage group has dramatically stepped up attacks on any vulnerable, unpatched Exchange servers worldwide.In each incident, the intruders have left behind a “web shell,” an easy-to-use, password-protected hacking tool that can be accessed over the Internet from any browser. The web shell gives the attackers administrative access to the victim’s computer servers.Speaking on condition of anonymity, two cybersecurity experts who’ve briefed U.S. national security advisors on the attack told KrebsOnSecurity the Chinese hacking group thought to be responsible has seized control over “hundreds of thousands” of Microsoft Exchange Servers worldwide — with each victim system representing approximately one organization that uses Exchange to process email.Microsoft said the Exchange flaws are being targeted by a previously unidentified Chinese hacking crew it dubbed “Hafnium,” and said the group had been conducting targeted attacks on email systems used by a range of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs.Microsoft’s initial advisory about the Exchange flaws credited Reston, Va. based Volexity for reporting the vulnerabilities. Volexity President Steven Adair said the company first saw attackers quietly exploiting the Exchange bugs on Jan. 6, 2021, a day when most of the world was glued to television coverage of the riot at the U.S. Capitol.But Adair said that over the past few days the hacking group has shifted into high gear, moving quickly to scan the Internet for Exchange servers that weren’t yet protected by the security updates Microsoft released Tuesday.“We’ve worked on dozens of cases so far where web shells were put on the victim system back on Feb. 28 [before Microsoft announced its patches], all the way up to today,” Adair said. “Even if you patched the same day Microsoft published its patches, there’s still a high chance there is a web shell on your server. The truth is, if you’re running Exchange and you haven’t patched this yet, there’s a very high chance that your organization is already compromised.”Reached for comment, Microsoft said it is working closely with the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), other government agencies, and security companies, to ensure it is providing the best possible guidance and mitigation for its customers.“The best protection is to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a written statement. “We continue to help customers by providing additional investigation and mitigation guidance. Impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.”Meanwhile, CISA has issued an emergency directive ordering all federal civilian departments and agencies running vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers to either update the software or disconnect the products from their networks.Adair said he’s fielded dozens of calls today from state and local government agencies that have identified the backdoors in their Exchange servers and are pleading for help. The trouble is, patching the flaws only blocks the four different ways the hackers are using to get in. But it does nothing to undo the damage that may already have been done.A tweet from Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, responding to a tweet from White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters today the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.By all accounts, rooting out these intruders is going to require an unprecedented and urgent nationwide clean-up effort. Adair and others say they’re worried that the longer it takes for victims to remove the backdoors, the more likely it is that the intruders will follow up by installing additional backdoors, and perhaps broadening the attack to include other portions of the victim’s network infrastructure.Security researchers have published several tools for detecting vulnerable servers. One of those tools, a script from Microsoft’s Kevin Beaumont, is available from Github.KrebsOnSecurity has seen portions of a victim list compiled by running such a tool, and it is not a pretty picture. The backdoor web shell is verifiably present on the networks of thousands of U.S. organizations, including banks, credit unions, non-profits, telecommunications providers, public utilities and police, fire and rescue units.“It’s police departments, hospitals, tons of city and state governments and credit unions,” said one source who’s working closely with federal officials on the matter. “Just about everyone who’s running self-hosted Outlook Web Access and wasn’t patched as of a few days ago got hit with a zero-day attack.”Another government cybersecurity expert who participated in a recent call with multiple stakeholders impacted by this hacking spree worries the cleanup effort required is going to be Herculean.“On the call, many questions were from school districts or local governments that all need help,” the source said, speaking on condition they were not identified by name. “If these numbers are in the tens of thousands, how does incident response get done? There are just not enough incident response teams out there to do that quickly.”When it released patches for the four Exchange Server flaws on Tuesday, Microsoft emphasized that the vulnerability did not affect customers running its Exchange Online service (Microsoft’s cloud-hosted email for businesses). But sources say the vast majority of the organizations victimized so far are running some form of Internet-facing Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) email systems in tandem with Exchange servers internally.“It’s a question worth asking, what’s Microsoft’s recommendation going to be?,” the government cybersecurity expert said. “They’ll say ‘Patch, but it’s better to go to the cloud.’ But how are they securing their non-cloud products? Letting them wither on the vine.”The government cybersecurity expert said this most recent round of attacks is uncharacteristic of the kinds of nation-state level hacking typically attributed to China, which tends to be fairly focused on compromising specific strategic targets.“Its reckless,” the source said. “It seems out of character for Chinese state actors to be this indiscriminate.”Microsoft has said the incursions by Hafnium on vulnerable Exchange servers are in no way connected to the separate SolarWinds-related attacks, in which a suspected Russian intelligence group installed backdoors in network management software used by more than 18,000 organizations.“We continue to see no evidence that the actor behind SolarWinds discovered or exploited any vulnerability in Microsoft products and services,” the company said.Nevertheless, the events of the past few days may well end up far eclipsing the damage done by the SolarWinds intruders.This is a fast-moving story, and likely will be updated multiple times throughout the day. Stay tuned.Update, 8:27 p.m. ET: Wired cybersecurity reporter Andy Greenberg has confirmed hearing the same number of victim numbers cited in this report: “It’s massive. Absolutely massive,” one former national security official with knowledge of the investigation told WIRED. “We’re talking thousands of servers compromised per hour, globally.” Read Greenberg’s account here.Also, the first and former director of CISA, Chris Krebs (no relation) seems to be suggesting on Twitter that the victim numbers cited here are conservative (or just outdated already):Update 8:49 p.m. ET: Included a link to one of the more recommended tools for finding systems vulnerable to this attack.Update, 10:17 p.m. ET: Added mention from Reuters story, which said White House officials are concerned about “a large number of victims.”Update, March 6, 10:56 a.m. ET: CISA’s Twitter account says the agency “is aware of widespread domestic and international exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and urges scanning Exchange Server logs with Microsoft’s detection tool to help determine compromise.”A tweet today from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

24,First time in Europe: Controls four-legged robot over 5G,Robotics/Automation,https://ing.dk/artikel/foerste-gang-europa-styrer-firbenet-robot-5g-244499,"
Når mobile robotter kan styres over mobilnetværk, udvides robotternes frihedsgrader markant – især udendørs. På Fyn har man netop testet en inspektion af hegn med en robot styret på afstand over 5G.Det er begrænset, hvor mange mobile robotter der bevæger sig rundt alene udendørs. For hvis en robot skal styres på afstand, så kræver det en stabil, hurtig og pålidelig netværksforbindelse, og det har været tæt på umuligt at opstå udendørs indtil for nylig. Derfor huserer mobile robotter som den firbenede Spot fra Boston Dynamics oftest indendørs, så både controller og robot er forbundet over et stabilt og hurtigt netværk.Men de begrænsninger er det nu lykkedes Teknologisk Institut at fjerne i samarbejde med den fælles 5G Innovation Hub drevet af TDC NET og Ericsson.Det er første gang i Europa, at en robot som Spot er blevet koblet på et 5G-net. Konkret er det TDCs nye 5G-net som Spot er blevet styret over. Det landsdækkende 5G-netværk, der er blevet færdigudrullet af TDC NET i samarbejde med Ericsson i slutningen af 2020, er kendetegnet ved højere hastigheder og lavere svartid.»Spot-samarbejdet med Teknologisk Institut er et godt og konkret eksempel på de muligheder, der åbnes for med 5G. Når man kobler de kendte teknologier som droner og mobile robotter til det hurtigere netværk, kan de løse nye, mere krævende opgaver og på den måde levere øget værdi. Vi er stadig tidligt i udviklingen, men baseret på de partnerskaber, vi sammen med Ericsson driver ud fra vores Innovationshub, er vi godt på vej til at realisere potentialet af 5G,« siger Toke Binzer, underdirektør hos TDC NET.Robotten bevæger sig ved hjælp af fire roterende led med elmotorer, der sidder på robothundens skuldre og bagben. Robottens sanser består af fem stereokameraer, der konstant kortlægger robottens omgivelser i 3D, og så sørger en IMU (inertial measurement unit)-sensor for at balancere de fire ben rigtigt i forhold til underlaget.Sensoren er bygget op om et accelerometer, et gyroskop og et kompas. De fem kameraer og sensoren sørger tilsammen for, at Spot hele tiden kan se tre til fire meter 360 grader rundt om sig, og på den måde kan den navigere uden om mennesker og forhindringer undervejs. Når Spot skal kravle op ad trapper, kan den i dag klare trin på op til 18 centimeter, ligesom den kan håndtere hældninger på +/-30 grader.Læs også: Klar på fire ben: Spot trasker videre, hvor andre robotter kører fastDen komplekse styring betyder, at selv små forsinkelser i netværket kan resultere i, at Spot tager et forkert skridt og falder ned af en trappe eller vælter over en kantsten.Jonas Bæch er konsulent fra Teknologisk Institut og den mest erfarne Spot-operatør i Danmark. Han mener, at 5G-netværket blandt andet gør det muligt at styre mobile robotter som Spot fra distancen samt indsamle, hente og bruge data fra robotten i realtid.»Indtil nu har kontrollen af robotten Spot kørt over wifi. Det har betydet, at man har mistet kontrollen over Spot, lige så snart robotten er gået fra at befinde sig indenfor til udenfor, eller den har bevæget sig mere end 30 meter væk fra operatøren,« fortæller Jonas Bæch.»Samtidig vil man på sigt kunne indhente data og billeder fra robotten i realtid, hvilket kan give robotteknologi en ny rolle inden for blandt andet inspektion, sikkerhed og i beredskabet,« siger Jonas Bæch.En af de opgaver, som en Spot på 5G-netværket muligvis kan hjælpe med, er inspektion af hegn. I mange lufthavne, byggepladser og havne er man underlagt sikkerhedsregler, der kan betyde, at man flere gange i løbet af en dag skal sikre sig, at hegnet ikke er beskadiget. Lorenz Technology, Teknologisk Institut og Hans Christian Andersen Airport har arbejdet sammen om at undersøge muligheden for at detektere og analysere tilstande af pigtrådshegn ved hjælp af deep learning-metoder.»Vi har sammen med Lorenz Technology undersøgt, om man kan automatisere den her tidskrævende proces. Ved at lade en robot gå langs hegnet og kontinuerligt optage billeder og analysere billederne, kan vi så få et indblik i, om hegnet skulle være defekt. Til at analysere billederne anvender vi kunstig intelligens og et regelsæt, som vi har sat op for, hvordan pigtråden ser ud, når den er intakt«, fortæller Thomas Høiberg Giselsson, der er seniorspecialist hos Teknologisk Institut, og fortsætter:Læs også: Sukker efter 5G: Mobile robotter savner stabile trådløse netværkI en lufthavn som Hans Christian Andersen Airport på Fyn er det sikkerhedspersonale, der inspicerer hegnet for at sikre, at det ikke er beskadiget. Men på sigt er det muligt at robotten kan melde om skader på hegnet mens den passerer lufthavnshegnet.»Ønsker man realtidsanalyser, er det nødvendigt enten at kunne behandle data direkte på Spot eller effektivt at kunne overføre data til en egnet enhed. Vores forsøg viste, at der er et potentiale for, at robotten Spot på 5G kan være med til at muliggøre realtidsanalysen,« siger han.På Fyn har den store danske producent af mobile robotter, MiR, længe efterspurgt 5G som et alternativ til wifi, og i det midt- og østjyske vokser der for tiden flere nye udendørs robotvirksomheder frem.»Vi er efterhånden en del virksomheder i det midt- og østjyske, der arbejder med udendørsrobotter, og derfor tror jeg, vi kan opbygge et stærkt fagligt netværk for terrængående robotter i forskellige afskygninger. Det særegne ved dansk robotudvikling er evnen til at arbejde sammen,« siger Mads Bendt, teknisk direktør i Capra Robotics, der har udviklet en udendørs mobilrobot.Ud over Capra Robotics fra Aarhus nævner Mads Bendt markrobotvirksomhederne Agrointelli og Conpleks, opstregningsrobotvirksomheden TinyMobileRobots, og RopeRobotics, der inspicerer vindmøllevinger, som eksempler på midt- og østjyske robotvirksomheder.Læs også: Nyt princip skal lukke robotterne ud af fabrikshallenHar spot ikke styringen indbygget?""Den komplekse styring betyder, at selv små forsinkelser i netværket kan resultere i, at Spot tager et forkert skridt og falder ned af en trappe eller vælter over en kantsten.""Jeg har det indtryk at Spot kun behøver overordnede kommandoer og så klare resten selv uden at behøve nogen extern styring.Hvorfor nævnes der ikke mobildata, det er da mere logisk at bruge udendørs end wifi.Mærkelig artikel...
Hvorfor nævnes der ikke mobildata, det er da mere logisk at bruge udendørs end wifi5g? Det er da netop mobildata.Jeg har det indtryk at Spot kun behøver overordnede kommandoer og så klare resten selv uden at behøve nogen extern styring.
Det er helt korrekt. Spot er fuldstændig autonom, og styres med simple kommandoer som ikke kræver høj båndbredde. Marques Brownlee har lavet en fin video om det: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6_azdBnAlUDet er billedoverførslen som er interessant i 5G sammenhæng. Inspektion af et hegn kunne nok klares i mindre end realtid, men hvis robotten skal interagere med noget kan det give god mening af have høj 5G båndbredde til rådighed.Det gælder navnlig i militære anvendelser, hvor Spot f.eks. kan udstyres med et automatvånben. Her vil et realtidsbillede med meget lille forsinkelse og god dækning være helt afgørende for succes. Se eksemplet her: https://spotsrampage.com/ (godt nok med en relativt uskyldig paintball riffel).Udvider man dækningsmulighederne for både billede og fjernbetjening, vil en sådan militær anvendelse få en vis betydning, da den vil kunne sættes ind over alt i verden. Boston Dynamics gik i rette med paintball demoen og kaldet det en ""provokerende anvendelse"", og advarede om, at hvis man fortsatte med det, ville det gøre garantien på Spot ugyldig. Se: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56182268Det tankevækkende er, at Boston's oprindelige forskning i udviklingen af det som nu er blevet til Spot, var finansieret af det amerikanske forsvar.Det gælder navnlig i militære anvendelser, hvor Spot f.eks. kan udstyres med et automatvånbenEn mulig anvendelse kunne være rottebekæmpelse i kloaker. Man har blot brug for nogle mindre fjernstyrede køretøjer, der er udstyret med kamera og et rottedræbende skydevåben. De kunne så blive styret online som et andet first-person shooter spil.Ved dog ikke lige hvordan 5G gør sig nede i en kloak.

25,Chinese Hacking Spree Hit an ‘Astronomical’ Number of Victims,Security,https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Andy GreenbergTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.When news hit earlier this week that Chinese hackers were  actively targeting Microsoft Exchange servers, the cybersecurity community warned that the zero-day vulnerabilities they were exploiting might have allowed them to hit countless organizations around the world. Now it's becoming clear just many email servers they hacked. By all appearances, the group known as Hafnium breached as many victims they could find across the global internet, leaving behind backdoors to return to later.Hafnium has now exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Exchange servers' Outlook Web Access to indiscriminately compromise no fewer than tens of thousands of email servers, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation into the hacking campaign who spoke to WIRED. The intrusions, first spotted by security firm Volexity, began as early as January 6, with a noticeable uptick starting last Friday and spiking early this week. The hackers appear to have responded to Microsoft's patch, released Tuesday, by ramping up and automating their hacking campaign. One security researcher involved in the investigation who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity put the number of hacked Exchange servers at more than 30,000 in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands worldwide, all apparently by the same group. Independent cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs first reported that 30,000 figure Friday, citing sources who had briefed national security officials.""It's massive. Absolutely massive,"" one former national security official with knowledge of the investigation told WIRED. ""We're talking thousands of servers compromised per hour, globally.""“It's a ticking time bomb.”Steven Adair, VolexityIn a press conference Friday afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned anyone running the affected Exchange servers to implement Microsoft's patch for the vulnerabilities immediately. ""We are concerned that there are a large number of victims and are working with our partners to understand the scope of this,"" Psaki said in a rare instance of a White House press secretary commenting on specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities. ""Network owners also need to consider whether they have already been compromised and should immediately take appropriate steps."" That White House advice echoed a tweet from former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs on Thursday night advising anyone with an exposed Exchange server to ""assume compromise"" and begin incident response measures to remove the hackers' access.The affected networks, which likely include those of small and medium-size organizations more than the large enterprises that tend to use cloud-based email systems, appear to have been hacked indiscriminately via automated scanning. The hackers planted a ""web shell""—a remotely accessible, web-based backdoor foothold—on the Exchange servers they exploited, allowing them to perform reconnaissance on the target machines and potentially move to other computers on the network.That means only a small number of the hundreds of thousands of hacked servers around the world are likely to be actively targeted by the Chinese hackers, says Volexity founder Steven Adair. Nonetheless, any organization that doesn't take pains to remove the hackers' backdoor remains compromised, and the hackers could reenter their networks to steal data or cause mayhem until that web shell is removed. ""A massive, massive number of organizations are getting that initial foothold,"" says Adair. ""It's a ticking time bomb that can be used against them at any point in time.""Though the vast majority of intrusions appear to have consisted only of those web shells, the ""astronomical"" scale of those global compromises is uniquely disturbing, one security researcher who participated in the investigation told WIRED. The small to medium-size organizations that were compromised include local government agencies, police, hospitals, Covid response, energy, transportation, airports, and prisons. ""China just owned the world—or at least everyone with Outlook Web Access,"" the researcher said. ""When was the last time someone was so bold as to just hit everyone?""In fact, the last such mass intrusion campaign came to light in just December, with the revelation that Russian hackers had compromised IT management tools from Solar Winds' used by 18,000 organizations. That hacking campaign successfully breached at least half a dozen US federal agencies. The Hafnium Exchange hacking campaign now represents the second hacking campaign of that scale, just a few months later.The Chinese hackers Exchange exploitation spree appears to have begun only months ago, in contrast to the Russia's silent, year-plus SolarWinds espionage campaign. And Hafnium's victim list appears more limited to small- and medium-sized organizations, whereas the SolarWinds hit large US government agencies.But as with the Russian SolarWinds hackers, investigators have yet to identify who exactly the Hafnium hackers are—beyond Microsoft's assertion that they're state-sponsored and operate out of China—or to pin down the full extent of their motivations. ""I don't understand what the strategic objective of maintaining persistence on a local government agency would be for the MSS,"" says the former national security official, referring to China's Ministry of State Security. ""Is this a contractor or a proxy group? Is it a Chinese cybercriminal group? Is it a rogue actor in China that got out ahead of itself?""While the hacking campaign may be aimed at casting a wide net before filtering targets for espionage, the security researcher who spoke to WIRED warned that it may yet have disruptive effects. ""If they push ransomware to this, we're going to have the worst day ever,"" he says.But unlike the SolarWinds incident, the researcher points out, the Exchange-hacking campaign was caught early—or at least early in its widespread use. As daunting as the task of cleaning up the hackers' tens of thousands of infections may be, that early detection may give victims a chance to both patch their systems and remove the hackers before they can take advantage of their foothold inside organizations. ""If we had a chance to prevent a SolarWinds-scale thing that went on for months, wouldn't we want to act on it?"" asks the researcher. ""Now we have that chance if we act fast.""WIRED is where tomorrow is realized. It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation. The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives—from culture to business, science to design. The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking, new connections, and new industries.More From WIREDContact© 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

26,Hackers Just Looted Passenger Data From Some of the Biggest Airlines,Security,https://gizmodo.com/hackers-just-looted-passenger-data-from-some-of-the-wor-1846417692,"SITA, a data firm that works with some of the world’s largest airlines, announced Thursday that it had been the victim of a “highly sophisticated cyberattack,” the likes of which compromised information on hundreds of thousands of airline passengers all over the world. The attack, which occurred in February, targeted data stored on SITA’s Passenger Service System servers, which are responsible for storing information related to transactions between  carriers and customers. One of the things SITA does is act as a mechanism for data exchange between different airlines—helping to ensure that passenger “benefits can be used across different carriers” in a systematized fashion. Understanding what specific data the hackers accessed is, at this point, a little tough—though it would appear that some of it was frequent flier information shared with SITA by members of the Star Alliance, the world’s largest global airline alliance.An airline alliance is basically an industry consortium, and Star’s membership is comprised of some of the world’s most prominent airlines—including United Airlines, Lufthansa, Air Canada, and  23 others. Of those members, a number have already stepped forward to announce breaches in connection with the attack—and SITA itself would appear to have acknowledged that the affected parties are connected to alliance memberships. One Alliance member, Air New Zealand, recently wrote to customers that “some of our customers’ data as well as that of many other Star Alliance airlines” had been affected by the SITA attack. Similarly,  Singapore Airlines recently told its customers that some of its data had been affected by the breach because “Star Alliance member airlines provide a restricted set of frequent flyer programme [sic] data to the alliance, which is then sent on to other member airlines to reside in their respective passenger service systems.”It’s unclear whether  all of the Star Alliance members have been affected. A SITA representative told TechCrunch that the breach “affects various airlines around the world, not just in the United States,” but declined to name all of them. We have reached out to SITA for comment and will update if they reply.So far, it would appear that the nature of the breach is more wide than deep. That is, a lot of people seem to have been affected, though in most cases the data that was being shared with SITA  does not seem that extensive. In the case of  Singapore Airlines, for instance, upwards of 500,000 people had their data compromised, though the data did not include things like member itineraries, passwords, or credit card information. The airline has stated:Around 580,000 KrisFlyer and PPS members have been affected by the breach of the SITA PSS servers. The information involved is limited to the membership number and tier status and, in some cases, membership name, as this is the full extent of the frequent flyer data that Singapore Airlines shares with other Star Alliance member airlines for this data transfer.So...having a hacker know how often you fly doesn’t really seem that bad, right? However, even if the SITA breach isn’t that extensive, it’s yet another great example of what kind of problem third parties pose for organizations within a supply chain—and what an appealing target they make for hackers. Because of the convoluted ways in which personal data is collected, stored, and shared, it’s incredibly easy for security officials to miss the weakest link in an industry’s chain. On the other hand, it can be incredibly easy for a hacker to spot one.Staff writer at Gizmodoat this point we should just have a list of companies that havent had major data breaches. "

BloombergMemorial services held online. Zen meditation apps. Buddhist temple-led match-making services.As the coronavirus pandemic forces institutions around the world to change the way they do things, those new endeavors are some of the ways that Buddhist groups in Japan are trying to survive. Their temples are part of the landscape: there are about 77,000, more than the number of the nation’s ubiquitous convenience stores.
COVID-19 has caused further pain for Buddhist organizations already struggling in recent years due to Japan’s shrinking population and the sagging interest in religion among the young. One estimate is that temples’ total income halved in the five years to 2020. And now the virus has kept believers at home, reducing donations they make for services such as memorials for the deceased.Buddhist temples have thrived in Japan for more than a millennium. But they need money to operate, and the pandemic has prompted some priests and monks to think of new ways to generate income. It’s a reflection of the way that industries worldwide from travel to dining and retail are having to improvise as COVID-19 restrictions batter their usual business.
Ryosokuin, a Zen temple with more than 660 years of history in Kyoto, is one such innovator. Faced with a drop-off in services such as memorials and a plunge in tourism, the organization boosted its online operations. It developed a meditation app that’s been downloaded more than 15,000 times that it expects to eventually monetize, and it’s organized an online zen meditation community called UnXe, meaning “cloud-sitting.”“When we lost visitors and donations fell, we realized that our conventional way of supporting our operations no longer works,” said Toryo Ito, deputy chief priest at the temple. “We need to adapt to a management style which meets with the times.”

Buddhism has a history stretching back to the 6th century in Japan, but few periods have brought such immense challenges. Over a third of temples may disappear by 2040 as the population grows old, according to Kenji Ishii, a religious studies professor at Kokugakuin University in Tokyo.Temple income is falling too. The total figure likely dropped about 51% since 2015 to ¥263 billion in 2020, according to estimates by Hidenori Ukai, the chief priest at the Shokakuji temple in Kyoto and a freelance journalist.The pandemic is adding to financial troubles across a broad swath of Japanese society. While the economy is recovering, a state of emergency in major cities beginning in January weighed on consumer spending. And businesses that serve customers face-to-face such as retailers have been hit especially hard, resulting in a spate of bankruptcies for restaurants and hotels.Tsukiji Hongwanji, a four-century-old temple near Tokyo’s old fish market, is another organization trying to make the best of the virus period. It started online memorial services last May for families that don’t want gatherings for the deceased, and has done about 70 such events, according to Yugen Yasunaga, a representative director and priest at the temple.The organization is also venturing into areas that staid temples aren’t traditionally known for, such as match-making services, a cafe and yoga classes, said Yasunaga, who worked in a major Japanese bank for more than two decades before starting his career at Tsukiji Hongwanji.“Just like Amazon.com responds to the various needs of customers online, a temple can do the same,” he said.

Google made some waves earlier this week when it boasted that it will soon stop tracking individuals via ads and their browsing activities. Many have understandably been wary about this announcement and believe that there must be a loophole which will still allow Google to track you and present you targeted ads.As usual, it is important to look past the headlines, as the devil is in the details. In this piece, we will take a look at what Google is proposing as an alternative to its usual tracking capabilities.Google tracks your online activity in a multitude of ways including your browsing habits, the metadata and telemetry it extracts from cookies, as well its software and hardware products such as your location, your search history, your interaction with Google Assistant, your Google account, Gmail, YouTube, and more.The company then builds a unique ad profile for you which can be used by ad providers to show you targeted ads. As can be seen from my own ad profile in the screenshot above - you can view yours here -, Google correctly knows that I'm a 24-year-old male, and my interests include movies, gaming, mobile platforms, cybersecurity, banking, and so on. Most of these are accurate and as you'll be able to grasp, this is only a portion of what Google thinks are interests relevant to me. The list is in alphabetical order and actually contains hundreds of topics that the company has assigned to my profile.Through this, it is extremely simple for ad providers to identify which ads they want to show me. Usama is interested in audio software? Let's start showing him ads for Spotify premium subscriptions. He's interested in antivirus software? Let's start showing him ads for Norton AntiVirus. The list goes on and on, and as you can see, there is huge value in this data for ad providers at the cost of individual privacy.However, Google says that it will soon stop tracking your individual interests in this manner. This is great news on paper but does this mean that the company won't track you at all? Not quite.Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) is a technique that Google proposed back in January 2020 as a part of its Privacy Sandbox initiative. This API, which is currently in testing, enables a privacy-preserving mechanism in the sense that rather than generating unique ad profiles for individuals, it assigns them to a group of people with similar interests. I will interchangeably use the terms ""group"", ""cluster"", and ""cohort"" this article.The idea is for browsers to locally analyze the user's habits without sending them to a server, and then assign them a cohort ID. For example, I may belong to ""Cohort A"", which will contain thousands of individuals with browsing habits similar to mine, while other cohorts (Cohort B, C, D...) will contain users whose interests are significantly different than mine.As such, when a cohort is developed and ready to be used to show ads, ad providers will have to present similar ads to the entire cohort rather than showing me ads specific to my interests. So, there will be scenarios if my group is assigned to a cohort consisting of predominantly people with interests in tech, I'll see ads related to tech, but not all of them will fully match my interests. Similarly, the same cohort may also be somewhat skewed towards people who like football alongside tech, so I'll be intermittently shown ads related to football, even though it's not a super-interesting topic to me.As FLoC is based on the idea of grouping users with similar interests, the key area of interest is cohort assignment. From a bird's eye view, Google is testing several algorithms to generate a p-dimensional binary vector based on a user's browsing history. All users who have a similar hash value will share the same cohort.Since the main reason behind this initiative is ensuring user privacy, Google says that a cohort must have at least ""k"" distinct users. Intuitively, the higher the value of ""k"", the greater privacy you will have across the web. The company has termed this metric ""K-anonymity"", saying that it is similar to hiding in a crowd.The principles behind FLoC include the fact that the algorithms used for cohort assignment should be unsupervised because providers will be using their own optimization functions and will not be dependent on labeled data. Similarly, a cohort should consist only of users with similar activity, and the ID should restrict individual cross-site tracking. In terms of the algorithm itself, it should be simple to compute because it will be run locally in browsers, and the parameters used should be easy to understand.Google tested multiple algorithms and judged them according to three metrics: privacy, utility, and centralization. There is an inherent tradeoff between the first two. The more privacy you have (that is, you belong to a large cluster), the less personalized ads you'll get, and vice versa. The goal is to have cohorts with large number of users, all with similar interests. Lastly, centralization refers to whether any information needs to be sent to a centralized server to calculate a cohort ID.All algorithms that Google has tested so far are clustering algorithms, which makes sense given the aim of the initiative. Although we won't go into the mathematical details of each algorithm since those are full-fledged topics altogether, we will be discussing them from a high-level along with their characteristics.First up is SimHash, which generates p-dimensional vectors based on input. The closer these vectors are, the more likely they are to be hashed to the same cohort. One of the inputs to the algorithm in this case can be a user's browsing history. If two users have similar browsing habits, the cosine angle between their vectors will be very small and they will likely be assigned the same cohort, and vice versa.The advantage of SimHash is that it does not depend upon other users to generate a cohort ID. A cohort ID can be generated without knowing about other users' vectors, because it depends solely upon your own browsing history. A drawback of this approach is that a minimum cluster size cannot be enforced without a central server. Without a minimum size, there may be edge cases where some clusters will contain hundreds of users will others will contain only a couple. A cohort server can be set up to tackle this problem which will track cluster sizes and will not allow the API to return the ID of a cluster that does not meet minimum requirements. This server will require a ""small bit length hash"" of the input - which is the user's browsing history in order to function.Secondly, we have the SortingLSH algorithm, but first it is important to understand why it is needed. The value of ""p"" in p-dimensional output vectors generated by SimHash is crucial in determining the potential sizes of cohorts. A smaller value may result in large cohorts while a large value may result in small cohorts, through which we circle back to the privacy-utility tradeoff.SortingLSH solves this problem via post-processing the results of SimHash. It does this by sorting the hash values in lexical order and then assign them to a cohort in such a way that each cohort should necessarily have at least ""k"" users.Of course, there is a drawback in this approach too, which may be immediately visible to some of our readers. Since the hashes have to be sorted before being assigned to a cluster, they depend upon other users. As such, a centralized server needs to do the sorting and obviously needs some information in order to do this processing, a disadvantage also present in the vanilla SimHash approach.In order to further enhance the privacy-utility tradeoff, Google also tested a technique called Affinity hierarchical clustering with centroids. What it does is that it generates a graph where users are nodes and the edges connecting them depict their similarity. Two nodes very close together will have a very short edge, showing their affinity. Then, this algorithm performs a bottom-up hierarchical agglomerative clustering by calculating new centroids and merging smaller clusters into bigger ones. The minimum size of a cluster is explicitly defined at the start of the clustering process.Although this results in better clusters because the information of one user is utilized to proactively find similar users, we have a disadvantage where a central server is generating graphs based on raw browsing history rather than hashes. In 2020, Google stated that this is due to the baseline naive algorithm it has built, and this concern could be resolved with ""federated learning technology"". We don't have the latest from Google regarding how successful its efforts have been at this point of time.Just because something sounds good on paper doesn't mean that it will perform similarly well in the real-world, so it is important to look at both aspects when evaluating performance of an algorithm. When Google tested these algorithms on public datasets containing information about preferences of users with regards to movies and music, the fully centralized algorithm, Affinity Clustering, outperformed decentralized methods such as SimHash and SortingLSH. But it is interesting to note that the latter two algorithms still achieved results that were 85% the quality of Affinity Clustering.Additionally, Google used Word Clouds to visualize the semantic meaning behind each cohort and noticed that decentralized methods typically produced large clusters which were somewhat well-defined whereas Affinity Clustering generated smaller clusters which were defined even better.After performing validation on public datasets, Google proceeded to test the algorithms on its own dataset. It contained proprietary data including de-identified URLs from publishers in the Google Display Network collected across seven days.As such, the input features fed to the algorithms were encoded URLs, domains, and topic categories. All clusters with a size below a minimum of ""k"" members were dropped from the evaluation process. Google notes that with SimHash, it noticed a 350% improvement in recall and a 70% improvement in precision even at very high anonymity levels when comparing to random clustering.Although Google has not reported the results of SortingLSH and Affinity Clustering so far, it claims that the performance was similar to that observed on public datasets.The results of the testing done so far has been very promising, showing that there is a potential way forward in protecting user privacy without compromising on utility. In this vein, Google has previously claimed that advertisers can expect to make at least 95% as many conversions per dollar spent compared to cookie-based advertising, so ads can live on and be effective without violating user privacy.The company has confirmed that it will be phasing out support for third-party cookies by 2022 and will no longer build identifiers in its products to track individual activity. The firm always uses the term ""individual"" to indicate the distinction between the two tracking techniques. To be clear, it isn't giving up on getting metadata from you, it's just making it difficult for providers to identify you based on your metadata.Privacy-preserving APIs using FLoC-based cohorts will enter public testing next month, and will also be tested with Google Ads advertisers in Q2 of this year. Google is welcoming feedback on its approaches and recommends that ad-tech providers evaluate the proposed algorithms on their own proprietary datasets too. The process will likely go through several iterations of enhancements and feedback before it becomes the norm within the next couple of years, provided that everything goes smoothly.All in all, Google will still be using your data to show you ads, but similar adverts will now be presented to the entire cohort rather than personalized to yourself only. Provided that a cluster size is large enough, your activity won't be identifiable to you unless it is combined with other signals. Similarly, your data won't be shared with a centralized server in raw format. This is in stark contrast to current methodologies where Google has built a complete ad profile unique for you that it can share with ad partners. Provided that the initiative is successful, Google hopes that browsers and ad partners will adopt it as the de facto standard for ads in the future.Coming back to the original question: Does this mean that the company won't track you at all? Kind of. It won't track your individual activity, but the activity of a group of similar users will be utilized to show ads, obviously at a lower granularity level than what we have right now, thus preserving privacy to some extent. Google will need to have strong governance and security procedures in place which ensure that users cannot be de-identified by combining their data with other signals, something that the company is already considering.

30,Thousands of Microsoft Customers May Have Been Victims of Hack Tied to China,Security,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/technology/microsoft-hack-china.html,"AdvertisementSupported byThe hackers started their attack in January but escalated their efforts in recent weeks, security experts say. Business and government agencies affected.By Kate Conger and Sheera FrenkelBusinesses and government agencies in the United States that use a Microsoft email service have been compromised in an aggressive hacking campaign that was probably sponsored by the Chinese government, Microsoft said.The number of victims is estimated to be in the tens of thousands and could rise, some security experts believe, as the investigation into the breach continues. The hackers had stealthily attacked several targets in January, according to Volexity, the cybersecurity firm that discovered the hack, but escalated their efforts in recent weeks as Microsoft moved to repair the vulnerabilities exploited in the attack.The U.S. government’s cybersecurity agency issued an emergency warning on Wednesday, amid concerns that the hacking campaign had affected a large number of targets. The warning urged federal agencies to immediately patch their systems. On Friday, the cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs reported that the attack had hit at least 30,000 Microsoft customers.“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said during a press briefing on Friday. The attack “could have far-reaching impacts,” she added.Federal officials were struggling to understand how the latest hack compared with last year’s intrusion into a variety of federal agencies and corporate systems by Russian hackers in what has become known as the SolarWinds attack. In that incident, the Russian hackers planted code in an update of the SolarWinds network management software. While about 18,000 customers of the company downloaded the code, so far there is only evidence that the Russian hackers stole material from nine government agencies and roughly 100 companies.In the hack that Microsoft has attributed to the Chinese, there are estimates that 30,000 or so customers were affected when the hackers exploited holes in Exchange, a mail and calendar server created by Microsoft. Those systems are used by a broad range of customers, from small businesses to local and state governments and some military contractors. The hackers were able to steal emails and install malware to continue surveillance of their targets, Microsoft said in a blog post, but Microsoft said it had no sense of how extensive the theft was.The campaign was detected in January, said Steven Adair, the founder of Volexity. The hackers quietly stole emails from several targets, exploiting a bug that allowed them to access email servers without a password.“This is what we consider really stealth,” Mr. Adair said, adding that the discovery set off a frantic investigation. “It caused us to start ripping everything apart.” Volexity reported its findings to Microsoft and the U.S. government, he added.But in late February, the attack escalated. The hackers began weaving multiple vulnerabilities together and attacking a broader group of victims. “We knew that what we had reported and seen used very stealthily was now being combined and chained with another exploit,” Mr. Adair said. “It just kept getting worse and worse.”The hackers targeted as many victims as they could find across the internet, hitting small businesses, local governments and large credit unions, according to one cybersecurity researcher who has studied the U.S. investigation into the hacks who is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The flaws used by the hackers, known as zero-days, were previously unknown to Microsoft.“We are closely tracking Microsoft’s emergency patch for previously unknown vulnerabilities in Exchange Server software and reports of potential compromises of U.S. think tanks and defense industrial base entities,” said Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser.“This is the real deal,” tweeted Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency. (Mr. Krebs is not related to the cybersecurity reporter who disclosed the number of victims.)Mr. Krebs added that companies and organizations that use Microsoft’s Exchange program should assume that they had been hacked sometime between Feb. 26 and March 3, and work quickly to install the patches released this past week by Microsoft.In a statement, Jeff Jones, a senior director at Microsoft, said, “We are working closely with the C.I.S.A., other government agencies and security companies to ensure we are providing the best possible guidance and mitigation for our customers.”Microsoft said a Chinese hacking group known as Hafnium, “a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China,” was behind the hack.Since the company disclosed the attack, other hackers not affiliated with Hafnium began to exploit the vulnerabilities to target organizations that had not patched their systems, Microsoft said. “Microsoft continues to see increased use of these vulnerabilities in attacks targeting unpatched systems by multiple malicious actors,” the company said.Patching these systems is not a straightforward task. Email servers are difficult to maintain, even for security professionals, and many organizations lack the expertise to host their own servers safely. For years, Microsoft been pushing these customers to move to the cloud, where Microsoft can manage security for them. Industry experts said the security incidents could encourage customers to shift to the cloud and be a financial boon for Microsoft.Because of the broad scope of the attack, many Exchange users are probably compromised, Mr. Adair said. “Even for people who patched this as fast as humanly possible, there’s an extremely high chance that they were already compromised.”Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"

32,"More than 20,000 U.S. organizations compromised through Microsoft flaw",Security,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AX23U,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Joseph Menn, Raphael Satter, Trevor Hunnicutt4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 20,000 U.S. organizations have been compromised through a back door installed via recently patched flaws in Microsoft Corp’s email software, a person familiar with the U.S. government’s response said on Friday.The hacking has already reached more places than all of the tainted code downloaded from SolarWinds Corp, the company at the heart of another massive hacking spree uncovered in December.The latest hack has left channels for remote access spread among credit unions, town governments and small businesses, according to records from the U.S. investigation.Tens of thousands of organizations in Asia and Europe are also affected, the records show.The hacks are continuing despite emergency patches issued by Microsoft on Tuesday.Microsoft, which had initially said the hacks consisted of “limited and targeted attacks,” declined to comment on the scale of the problem on Friday but said it was working with government agencies and security companies to provide help to customers.It added, “impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.”One scan of connected devices showed only 10% of those vulnerable had installed the patches by Friday, though the number was rising.Because installing the patch does not get rid of the back doors, U.S. officials are racing to figure out how to notify all the victims and guide them in their hunt.All of those affected appear to run Web versions of email client Outlook and host them on their own machines, instead of relying on cloud providers. That may have spared many of the biggest companies and federal government agencies, the records suggest.The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.Microsoft and the person working with the U.S. response blamed the initial wave of attacks on a Chinese government-backed actor. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions.What started as a controlled attack late last year against a few classic espionage targets grew last month to a widespread campaign. Security officials said that implied that unless China had changed tactics, a second group may have become involved.More attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.The hackers have only used the back doors to re-enter and move around the infected networks in a small percentage of cases, probably less than 1 in 10, the person working with the government said.“A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can,” stealing data and installing other ways to return later, he said.The initial avenue of attack was discovered by prominent Taiwanese cyber researcher Cheng-Da Tsai, who said he reported the flaw to Microsoft in January. He said in a blog post that he was investigating whether the information leaked.He did not respond to requests for further comment.Reporting by Raphael Satter and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Rosalba O’BrienOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Will Reopened NYC Movie Theaters Lead to Box Office Recovery (and Blockbusters’ Return)?Photo illustration by TheWrap (Getty Images)The pandemic, protests and the U.S. presidential election fueled a boom in digital news subscriptionsDespite the ongoing drumbeat of reported doom and gloom for the survival of publishing, a new report on the subscription economy says subscription revenue for digital news and information publications increased by 16% in 2020 even in the face of declining advertising revenues. Overall, the study concludes that the subscription economy has grown by nearly 500% in the past decade.Zuora, an enterprise software company that creates and provides software to launch and manage subscription based services, said in its bi-annual report that major news stories — including the COVID-19 crisis, racial inequality protests and the contentious U.S. presidential election — fueled a boom in subscribers for newspapers, magazines, book publishers, educational content providers and corporate research providers.Join WrapPRO for Exclusive Content,  Full Video Access, Premium Events, and More!In its report  Zuora, headquartered in Redwood City, provides as an example that the legacy magazine The Atlantic, founded in 1857, added 36,000 new digital subscribers in four weeks during the pandemic, even as they lifted paywall restrictions on coronavirus coverage. The Atlantic also highlighted its subscription gains last September, saying the publication added 300,000 subscribers compared to the year prior.“From the COVID-19 pandemic, to Brexit, to protests in response to racial  injustice, to a monumental U.S. election, 2020 may go down as one of the most news-breaking years in the existence of digital publishing,” the Zuora report stated. “Meanwhile, public trust in all sources of information reached record lows. Trust levels  declined across traditional media, search engines, and social media — by  eight, six, and five percentage points, respectively — and many readers  turned to alternative information sources.”Also Read: The Los Angeles Times in Crisis: Stalled Subscriptions, Drowsy Leadership, Slack Channel Trash Talk (Exclusive)Publishing Sector Revenue Growth-Zuora Subscription Economy Report 2021The Zuora report included grim statistics on advertising revenues for print and digital publishing. According to PwC’s Media Outlook report, as quoted in the study, global newspaper advertising (print and online) will fall from $49.2 billion in 2019 to $36 billion in 2024, a decline of more than a quarter (27%) over five years. However, the Zuora’s report suggests that growing subscription revenues may help offset the losses.“Advertising has been languishing for years,” Amy Konary, founder and chair of Zuora’s Subscribed Institute think tank, told TheWrap. “Many ads are designed to prey on consumer self-esteem or use misleading information to make sales; the effectiveness of these ads is declining, and serious concerns have been raised about consumer privacy.”Konary said digital subscription-based publishers don’t need advertising revenue to survive: “Instead, these companies are thriving on strong customer relationships, created through the delivery on ongoing innovation and value in the form of high-quality, personalized content.”Also Read: Disney+ Tops 94 Million Subscribers as Pandemic Continues to Drag Down Bottom LineThe study also reported marked growth in media subscriptions, citing Deloitte’s Digital Media Trends Survey. “Before COVID-19, the  average U.S. consumer had 12 paid media and entertainment subscriptions. As reported in the same survey, since the pandemic began, 23% of U.S. consumers have added at least one new paid video streaming service.” the report said. “This is evidence  of the growing popularity of streaming media. Subscription models help media companies to create subscriber-centric experiences, building ongoing relationships with their subscribers across whatever channels they choose.”The report also included revenue growth information for telecommunications, manufacturing, business services, health care and education, among other categories.Senior Entertainment Business Reporter • diane@thewrap.com • @dhaithman‘Good Girls’ Makes a Good Case for NBC Ditching Traditional TV RatingsRatings: ‘The Chase’ Season Finale Was Left Chasing ‘Clarice’ in Total ViewersWill Reopened NYC Movie Theaters Lead to Box Office Recovery (and Blockbusters’ Return)?Meet the TV Journalists Leading Coverage of the Rise in Anti-Asian ViolenceOscars Gender Gap Narrows: Women Directed Record 27% of Best Picture ContendersRatings: ‘Name That Tune’ Season Finale Hands Fox Wednesday WinHow Disney+ Re-Created Must-Watch TV With ‘WandaVision’ and ‘The Mandalorian’Why Snap CEO Evan Spiegel Believes Revenue Could Skyrocket in the Next 3 YearsRatings: ABC Settles for Fourth-Place Tie With Univision on Night ‘Soul of a Nation’ DebutsDisney CEO Bob Chapek’s First Year Report Card: High Marks for Not ‘Steering it Off a Cliff’Even George Stephanopoulos Can’t Deny David Muir’s ‘World News Tonight’ Ratings Turnaround@2019 - The Wrap News Inc.

34,Doctors Can 3D Print Bones Directly Into Your Body - The Debrief,Biotechnology,https://thedebrief.org/doctors-can-3d-print-bones-directly-into-your-body/,"A recent Australian study outlines how a new type of hybrid material may allow bone replacements to be printed directly inside a patient’s body in a dramatic step toward solving many issues with current bone replacement techniques. This process includes the ability to print bone using live cells and without the use of harsh chemicals, both of which are staples of current methods.Detailed in a research paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, by study co-authors Dr. Iman Roohani, a bioengineer from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) School of Medicine, and Dr. Kristopher Kilian, from UNSW’s School of Chemistry, their process used an off-the-shelf 3D printer, along with their custom-designed “ink.”At present, the best, most proven method for bone replacement is an autologous graft, where a section of the patient’s own bone is taken from another part of the body and grafted onto the site where the new bone is needed. Unfortunately, this method still has high rates of rejection and a limit to the amount of bone that can be harvested in the first place.Various attempts to synthesize a suitable replacement have been tried, including using hydrogels, thermoplastics, or even bio-ceramic “hyper-elastic” pseudo-bones. Still, like autologous grafts, all have met several hurdles. That’s primarily due to the unique combination of living and dead tissue that makes up the typical human bone.“Bone is a highly mineralized tissue which forms at ambient conditions by continuous crystallization of the mineral phase within an organic matrix in the presence of bone residing cells,” explains their research paper, before concluding that, “despite recent advances in the biofabrication of complex engineered tissues, replication of the heterogeneity of bone microenvironments has been a major challenge in constructing biomimetic bone scaffolds.”The process these researchers have pioneered, they say, is different.“In contrast https://thedebrief.org/with-the-help-of-a-dead-insect-israeli-reseato previous materials, our technique offers a way to print constructs in situ which mimic the structure and chemistry of the bone,” said Dr. Roohani in an interview with IEEE Spectrum. “The opportunities are limitless.”To meet this daunting list of challenges, the UNSW team spent two years perfecting a biocompatible calcium phosphate material, meaning it wouldn’t present a risk of rejection by the host and one that also forms a malleable paste at room temperature. That material is then placed in a gelatin bath or other aqueous environment to simulate the inside of a human body, causing a chemical reaction to occur, which hardens the paste into a porous matrix or nanocrystals much like the actual bone it is replacing. 
“It’s really the first example of integrating ceramic materials that emulate many aspects of native bone with live cells,” says fellow project researcher Kris Kilian in a short video highlighting the technique. “This really opens up the opportunity where you may be able to actually directly print a patient’s bone within a cavity.”Kilian explains the technique’s advantage further, describing how, “during surgery, if they [the patient] have a bone resected for disease, or have a tumor taken out, then we can actually take scans of that bone, and then put that onto [sic] the 3D printer, and then directly print, within a cavity of a patient, with their own cells being there. And those cells may be able to then graft, and form native bone naturally.”In that same video, Dr. Kilian sums up the advantages this process offers, all ideally leading to “quicker surgery times, a reduction in suffering, and also hopefully [saving] lots of lives.”The research team’s exact method is still undergoing refinements, but they performed their successful tests with an off-the-shelf 3D printer, specifically the Hyrel 3D Engine HR. They did, however, equip the device with a custom nozzle.Dubbed ‘COBICS’ for Ceramic Omnidirectional Bioprinting in Cell-Suspensions, Dr. Roohani says that in the future, their process can also be adapted to work on other types of 3D printers including portable and handheld types that can be used directly in the surgical theater. “You’ll need to engineer the printer for each application,” he explained in the IEE Spectrum post, “but the concept and the principle of the technique will be similar.”Moving forward, the team is now in the process of designing a bath that will let them print even larger replacement bone samples. They are reportedly undergoing small animal tests to see how it stacks up against traditional bone grafts. After that, they are reportedly hoping to work with dentists, surgeons, and other healthcare professionals to look into specific applications and possibly even partner with them to seek FDA approval, which is something the regulatory agency has already indicated they would be willing to consider.Join us on Twitter or Facebook to weigh in and share your thoughts.

35,Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds,Politics,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312065/fcc-highspeed-broadband-service-ajit-pai-bennet-angus-king-rob-portman,"Filed under:The Pai FCC decided to maintain the current standardThe federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. In a letter to government leaders Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. “Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) wrote to the FCC and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, which established the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. Zoom recommends 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET: Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.A newsletter about computers"

37,"U.S. agency probes Facebook for 'systemic' racial bias in hiring, promotions",Politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive-idUSKBN2AY006,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Paresh Dave4 Min Read(Reuters) - A U.S. agency investigating Facebook Inc for racial bias in hiring and promotions has designated the probe as “systemic,” attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters on Friday.A “systemic” probe means the agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, suspects company policies may be contributing to widespread discrimination.The EEOC typically resolves disputes through mediation or allowing complainants to sue employers. But agency officials designate a few cases “systemic,” enabling investigators to rope in specialists to analyze company data and potentially bring a broader lawsuit representing entire classes of workers.Facebook operations program manager Oscar Veneszee Jr. and two applicants denied jobs brought a charge last July to the EEOC, and a third rejected applicant joined the case in December. They have alleged Facebook discriminates against Black candidates and employees by relying on subjective evaluations and promoting problematic racial stereotypes.The designation of the EEOC’s probe has not been previously reported.The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook. Its investigation, which may last months more, may not result in findings of wrongdoing. The agency declined to comment.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment on the status of the probe or specific allegations but said that “it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment.”“We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case,” he said.The EEOC brought in systemic investigators by last August and received detailed briefing papers from both sides over the last four months, said Peter Romer-Friedman, an attorney at Gupta Wessler representing Veneszee and the job candidates.Employment law firms Mehri & Skalet and Katz Marshall & Banks also are helping the workers.The EEOC’s Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Washington offices are involved, attorneys from the firms said.Facebook’s counsel, Covington & Burling, did not respond to a request for comment.Increasing racial and gender diversity has been a persistent challenge for the nation’s largest tech companies, which at times have blamed a shortage of qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. But tech workers have grown emboldened to publicly challenge that notion and allege in formal complaints that biased employment practices cause disparities.Romer-Friedman said he and his colleagues told the EEOC in a submission last month that one such Facebook policy is awarding employees bonuses of up to $5,000 when a candidate they refer is hired. Referred candidates tend to reflect the makeup of existing employees, disadvantaging Black professionals, he said.Facebook said about 3.9% of its U.S. employees as of last June were Black.David Lopez, a former EEOC general counsel now teaching at Rutgers University, said that systemic investigations are significant because of the additional resources involved. When they result in allegations of wrongdoing, multimillion-dollar settlements sometimes follow, he said, citing recent cases against Dollar General Corp and Walmart Inc.In the year ended last Sept. 30, 13 of the 93 EEOC merit lawsuits were systemic, according to agency data.Last December, the Justice Department accused Facebook of discriminating against U.S. workers broadly, saying it gave hiring preference to temporary workers such as H-1B visa holders.Alphabet Inc’s Google last month agreed to spend $3.8 million to settle U.S. government allegations that it underpaid women and unfairly passed over women and Asians for job openings.Reporting by Paresh Dave in Oakland, Calif.; Editing by Kenneth Li, Jonathan Weber and Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

38,An atom pushed to its speed limit,Nanotech/Materials,https://physics.aps.org/articles/v14/26,"Moving information from one place to another takes time, even in the quantum world. A team of researchers has now moved an atom in the shortest time possible, in a way that preserves the information that it contains [1]. Achieving the top overall speed turned out to require a series of accelerations and decelerations, not a constant cruise. The finding could lead to ways of optimizing speed and accuracy in future quantum technologies.Disturbances from the environment degrade the performance of quantum computers, and carrying out the calculations as quickly as possible is one way to reduce such effects. But running calculations too quickly can also lead to information loss, so there is a “speed limit” on such systems.For simple, two-level quantum systems, such as an electron (which can be spin-up or spin-down), researchers have performed quantum operations at the theoretically predicted speed limits. However, some quantum technologies, such as atom interferometers, require a system to move among many quantum states. These systems should also have speed limits, but they have not been predicted or measured.Andrea Alberti of the University of Bonn in Germany and his colleagues have now studied an example of such a speed limit. They measured the fastest speed at which an atom could be moved from one place to another, ending at the new location in the same state in which it began, despite transitioning to other states during the trip. Moving too rapidly can cause the atom to end up in a different state, which means that it loses information. Keeping the information safe while moving as fast as possible is a bit like transferring a bowl containing water from one location to another at the highest possible speed that avoids a spill.For their experiments, the team used a so-called optical lattice trap, in which atoms sit in a row of potential energy valleys produced by a pair of overlapping, oppositely directed laser beams. They used a microwave field to cool the atoms to their lowest (ground) vibrational state. In this state, each atom is like a fluid sloshing back and forth in a bowl with the smallest possible amplitude; excited states correspond to larger-amplitude oscillations. The goal was to end in the ground state, even though the atoms transitioned to excited states along the way.To transport the atoms, the team caused the valleys to move like a conveyor belt, with each valley moving as far as its nearest neighbor. They could vary the speed of the conveyor belt, and they used measurement techniques that allowed subnanometer tracking of the motion.Alberti and his colleagues transported their atoms a distance of 0.5 micrometers using both constant-speed and variable-speed schemes. In each case, the researchers measured the fidelity, a parameter characterizing the similarity of the initial and final states. The protocol with the best fidelity involved a series of speedups and slowdowns. These speed “wiggles” canceled out the effects of transitions to excited states that occurred during the transport process, ensuring that the atoms ended in the ground state. This wiggling is analogous to physically wiggling a bowl containing water to counteract excessive sloshes as it is moved at high speed—tipping it forward a bit at the beginning of its journey and backward a bit at the end.The researchers found that when the average speed over the trip was below about 17 millimeters per second, the fidelity was very good, but it dropped to much lower values for higher average speeds. The team developed a theory to explain this measured speed limit.“The finding is a compelling demonstration of how fundamental properties of quantum dynamics change when one goes beyond the well-studied case of a two-level system,” says Nora Tischler, a quantum physicist at Griffith University in Australia. “I am excited by this work,” she adds. Daniel Burgarth of Macquarie University, also in Australia, is equally impressed. He hopes that the new method will be adapted by other groups to operate complex quantum systems at or near their speed limits.–Katherine WrightKatherine Wright is the Deputy Editor for Physics.Manolo R.

40,Why You Can’t Sue Your Broadband Monopoly,Business,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/why-you-cant-sue-your-broadband-monopoly,"EFF Legal Fellow Josh Srago co-wrote this blog postThe relationship between the federal judiciary and the executive agencies is a complex one. While Congress makes the laws, they can grant the agencies rulemaking authority to interpret the law. So long as the agency’s interpretation of any ambiguous language in the statute is reasonable, the courts will defer to the judgment of the agency.For broadband access, the courts have deferred to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC’s) judgment on the proper classification of broadband services twice in the last several years. In 2015, the Court deferred to the FCC when it classified broadband as Title II in the Open Internet Order. In 2017, it deferred again when broadband internet was reclassified as Title I in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. A Title II service is subject to strict FCC oversight, rules, and regulations, but a Title I service is not.Classification of services isn’t the only place where the courts defer to the FCC’s authority. Two Supreme Court decisions – Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Billing – have established the precedent that if an industry is overseen by an expert regulatory agency (such as broadband being overseen by the FCC) then the courts will defer to the agency’s judgment on competition policy because the agency has the particular and specific knowledge to make the best determination.In other words, civil antitrust law has to overcome multiple barriers in applying to broadband providers, potentially denying it as a remedy for monopolization for consumers. EFF's conducted an in-depth analysis on this issue. For a summary, read on.What this creates is circular deferential reasoning. The FCC has the authority to determine whether or not broadband will be subject to strict oversight or subject to no oversight and the courts will defer to the FCC’s determination. If the service is subject to strict rules and regulations, then the FCC has the power to take action if a provider acts in an anti-competitive way. Courts will defer to the FCC’s enforcement powers to ensure that the market is regulated as it sees fit.However, if the FCC determines that the service should not be subject to the strict rules and regulations of Title II and a monopoly broadband provider acts in an anticompetitive way, the courts will still defer to the FCC’s determination as to whether the bad actor is doing something they should not. If the courts did otherwise, then their determination would be in direct conflict with the regulatory regime established by the FCC to ensure that the market is regulated as it sees fit.What this means is that individuals and municipalities are left without a legal pathway when a broadband service provider abuses its monopoly powers under our antitrust laws. A complaint can be filed with the FCC regarding the behavior, but how that complaint is handled is subject to the FCC’s decisions, not on whether the conduct is anti-competitive.The best path forward to resolve this is for Congress to pass legislation that overturns Trinko and Credit Suisse, ensuring that people, or representatives of people such as local governments, can protect their interests and aren’t being taken advantage of by incumbent monopoly broadband providers. But what will that world look like? EFF analyzed that question and theorized how things could improve for consumers. You can read our memo here. As Congress debates reforming antitrust laws with a focus on Big Tech, there are a lot of downstream positive impacts that can stem from such reforms, namely in giving people the ability to sue their broadband monopolist and use the courts to bring in competition.The multi-pronged attempt by state Attorneys General, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission to find Google and Facebook liable for violating antitrust law may result in breaking up these giant companies.

41,The Latest Microsoft Hack Looks Like It Could Be Huge | Gizmodo,Security,https://gizmodo.com/the-latest-microsoft-hack-looks-like-it-could-be-huge-1846397829,"Microsoft announced this week that another one of its email products, Exchange, had been compromised by a  hacking campaign. This recent hack is actually totally unrelated to the “SolarWinds” one, in which Microsoft has also played an outsized role. A state-sponsored threat actor from China dubbed “HAFNIUM” is said to be exploiting a number of zero-day flaws in on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers all over the globe in an apparent effort to steal data. Exchange essentially works with mail clients like Microsoft Office, ensuring that updates to devices are synchronized. It’s a very widely used product, to say the least. While Microsoft has sought to play down the potential scope of this hack (calling it “limited and targeted” in nature), it is beginning to look like that assessment is actually really, really wrong.Among the numerous parties to disagree with the “limited and targeted” assessment is the White House, which said Friday that they were “concerned” about the extent of the attack. During a press conference, Biden administration spokesperson Jen Psaki said: Everyone running these servers — government, private sector, academia — needs to act now to patch them. We are concerned that there are a large number of victims and are working with our partners to understand the scope of this...Network owners also need to consider whether they have already been compromised and should immediately take appropriate steps. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an emergency directive to agencies, and we’re now looking closely at the next steps we need to take. It’s still developing. We urge network operators to take it very seriously...In the latest in a string of security-related headaches for Microsoft, the company warned customers Indeed, CISA took the unusual step Wednesday of mandating that all federal agencies patch the Exchange servers if they were in use: “CISA has determined that this exploitation of Microsoft Exchange on-premises products poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and requires emergency action,” the agency reported, giving agencies until noon Friday to patch related vulnerabilities. All this concern might be due to certain claims floating around that the parties affected by the hack could number in the tens of thousands. Indeed, KrebsOnSecurity made the bold claim Friday that “at least 30,000"" U.S. organizations were hacked via the newly discovered flaws in Exchange servers, and that potentially hundreds of thousands of servers worldwide were hacked as a result of the campaign. Reuters similarly reports that more than “20,000 American organizations” have been compromised by the vulnerabilities, according to an anonymous source familiar with the government’s response efforts.Jake Sullivan, who serves as National Security Advisor to President Biden, made it clear via Twitter that the administration was alarmed: Chris Krebs, the former director of  CISA, similarly said Friday that organizations that had their server exposed to the internet during a specific time frame should just “assume” they had been compromised by the hacking campaign:A more on-the-ground perspective of the hack was provided by security firm Huntress, which released a report Wednesday in which they detailed the extent to which they had seen webshells deployed against unpatched Microsoft servers:Currently, we’ve identified 176 of our partners servers that have been received the webshell payload from Update 1 (below). These companies do not perfectly align with Microsoft’s guidance as some personas are small hotels, an ice cream company, a kitchen appliance manufacture, multiple senior citizen communities and other “less than sexy” mid-market businesses. With that said, we have also witnessed many city and county government victims, healthcare providers, banks/financial institutions, and several residential electricity providers.When questioned about the Huntress report Wednesday, Microsoft sent a brief statement our way, simply stating: As we said in our blogs, we recommend customers update as soon as possible as we anticipate that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems.Staff writer at GizmodoChrist.

42,The Strange Story of DC's Lost AM Radio Station Still Transmitting Inauguration Road Closures From 2013,Society,https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39549/the-strange-story-of-dcs-lost-am-radio-station-still-transmitting-inauguration-road-closures-from-2013,"Not everyone pays the most attention to AM radio. To some, talk is talk and fuzzy signals are exactly that. Still, it'd be odd if the same broadcast looped continuously for eight years without anyone noticing—but it's not impossible.As it turns out, that very scenario took place up until this week in Washington D.C. where an AM radio station had been broadcasting the same traffic report since 2013, and nobody seems to know why.It was first pointed out on Twitter by Matt Blaze, security researcher and chair of computer science and law at Georgetown University. In certain parts of D.C., you could tune-in to 1650 kHz and be greeted by a looped recording. The message, which read off the call sign WQOQ613 and warned listeners to avoid the 14th Street bridges, had been repeating since at least Jan. 21, 2013—the day of former U.S. President Barack Obama's second inauguration. But that was more than eight years ago. Why in the world would this message still be broadcasting? And why could it only be picked up in certain parts of the city?To answer that question, I reached out to several individuals who work for the District of Columbia, including the technical contact registered with the FCC. Within an hour of sending off an email, my phone rang and Bill Curry, the chief of communications security at Homeland Security Emergency Management in Washington D.C., was on the other end.Bill was immediately interested in the rogue signal. He didn't seem rushed or bothered by the fact that the message was being broadcasted, but was instead curious that it managed to stay alive for so long without anyone knowing that it existed or complaining that it was out of date. See, Bill has been a radio enthusiast his entire life, even building homemade Ham radios before he began working with RF professionally, so the thought that some unmanned station was looping a recorded message was...intriguing.While on the phone, Bill's brother flipped on his historic Zenith Trans-Oceanic radio and sure enough, the traffic report began to play. Couple his interest with the security and communications work he does with Fusion Centers and it was clear that he needed to know where the signal was being broadcast—if, for nothing else, to satisfy his curiosity.After exchanging stories about adventures in our own siloed worlds of engineering, Bill had a theory that actually seemed quite plausible: someone just forgot to flip the off-switch. See, when it comes to radio communications in Washington D.C., many people live under the ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" philosophy—especially since erecting a new radio tower is an extremely complicated process within a certain radius of the nation's capital.According to Bill, the signal may have been originally transmitted on several temporary stations, all of which were thought to have been decommissioned some time ago. Some of these transmitters may have been affixed to telephone poles on the side of the highway, while others could've been stuffed into two-wheeled trailers to be towed wherever needed. The equipment in these trailers is often powered by solar panels so it can operate without an external power source. His bet was on the latter, that the case of the mystery radio signal may have just been sitting in a vacant parking lot getting power from the sun and transmitting the same traffic information day after day for eight years.Because the location of the transmitter wasn't documented, Bill needed to organize an effort to locate it. His team set off with a Radio Direction Finder (RDF), a device with a unidirectional antenna meant to help find the source of a radio signal, and began the hunt. And by the following afternoon, the signal finally stopped broadcasting across the D.C. airwaves.It's honestly kind of upsetting to know that it's gone—a little less electricity in the air. Just as quickly as it was found, the mystery signal simply fizzled out. Someone at Bill's directive must have found the transmitter and finally finished the job someone forgot to do eight years ago. We'd like to think of it as a service, considering the license expired later this year anyway (a decade after it was issued).Unfortunately, while the signal may be no more, we still don't know exactly where it was being transmitted from. Perhaps it was a trailer parked in a vacant lot, or maybe a station was stuffed inside of an old decommissioned building. The world may never know—but at least we won't forget about the eight years of a phantom government traffic report riding the airwaves of Washington D.C.Got a tip or question for the author?

Four US senators called on the Biden administration Thursday to establish a ""21st century definition of high-speed broadband"" of 100Mbps both upstream and downstream. This would be a big upgrade over the Federal Communications Commission broadband standard of 25Mbps downstream and 3Mbps upstream, which was established in 2015 and never updated by former President Trump's FCC chair, Ajit Pai.Today's letter was sent to FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and other federal officials by two Democrats, one independent who caucuses with Democrats, and one Republican. Noting that ""the pandemic has reinforced the importance of high-speed broadband and underscored the cost of the persistent digital divide in our country,"" they wrote:Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality, including low latency, high reliability, and low network jitter, for modern and emerging uses, like two-way videoconferencing, telehealth, remote learning, health IoT, and smart grid applications. Our goal for new deployment should be symmetrical speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps), allowing for limited variation when dictated by geography, topography, or unreasonable cost.""We should also insist that new networks supported with federal funds meet this higher standard, with limited exceptions for truly hard-to-reach locations,"" the senators wrote later in the letter. ""For years, we have seen billions in taxpayer dollars subsidize network deployments that are outdated as soon as they are complete, lacking in capacity and failing to replace inadequate broadband infrastructure.""The letter was written by Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Angus King (I-Maine), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). In addition to Rosenworcel, it was sent to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese.""Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to 'high-speed' in the year 2021,"" they wrote. ""For any of these functions, upload speeds far greater than 3Mbps are particularly critical. These challenges will not end with the pandemic.""Rosenworcel already supports a standard above the FCC's current one. ""With so many of our nation's providers rolling out gigabit service, it's time for the FCC to adjust its baseline upward, too,"" she said in April 2020, calling for a 100Mbps download standard and an upload standard that's higher than 3Mbps. ""At present, our standard [for uploads] is 3 megabits per second,"" she said at the time. ""But this asymmetrical approach is dated. We need to recognize that with extraordinary changes in data processing and cloud storage, upload speeds should be rethought.""The FCC standard is important for the commission's annual broadband deployment report that determines how many Americans are ""unserved"" and grades the country's progress toward universal availability. Adopting a higher speed standard would make it more likely that the FCC will find that broadband deployment is not happening fast enough and take more aggressive action to speed up deployment.The FCC isn't as active as it could be right now because there is a 2-2 split between Democrats and Republicans. President Joe Biden can fix that by nominating a new Democratic commissioner, but he hasn't done so yet.Going from 25/3Mbps to 100/100Mbps would be an especially large upgrade on the upload side. Today's offerings from cable companies would not meet the 100Mbps threshold for uploads, as even gigabit-download cable plans from Comcast and Charter come with only 35Mbps upload speeds. The cable industry for years has been promising faster upload speeds powered by upgrades to DOCSIS, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification. But cable's speeds are still unbalanced, providing much greater download speeds than upload speeds.By contrast, AT&T and Verizon's fastest fiber plans come with 940Mbps download speeds and 880Mbps upload speeds. Even the cheaper, lower-tier plans offered by fiber-to-the-home ISPs meet the senators' proposed 100/100Mbps standard.Cable is far more widespread than fiber in the US. The eight biggest cable companies combined have 72.8 million Internet subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group. The top eight wireline phone companies have 33 million Internet subscribers, but that includes both fiber-to-the-home and DSL, and those copper-line DSL networks are severely outdated and poorly maintained.A serious commitment to symmetrical 100Mbps broadband may require a lot more fiber construction across the US. The senators' letter didn't quite take a fiber-or-bust stand, but they do want federal funding in rural areas to support higher upload speeds than what you normally get with cable:While we recognize that in truly hard-to-reach areas, we need to be flexible in order to reach unserved Americans, we should strive to ensure that all members of a typical family can use these applications simultaneously. There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas (e.g., according to speedtest.net's January 2021 analysis, average service is currently 180Mbps download/65Mbps upload with 24 millisecond latency.The senators are also frustrated by differing standards across agencies. ""We now have multiple definitions across federal agencies for what constitutes an area as served with broadband, resulting in a patchwork without one consistent standard for broadband,"" they wrote. ""For example, the FCC defines high-speed broadband as download speeds of up to 25 megabits per second and upload speeds of up to 3 megabits per second (25/3Mbps). Alternatively, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines it as just 10/1Mbps.""The FCC is already supporting networks faster than the 25/3Mbps standard. The commission's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) tentatively awarded $9.2 billion over 10 years to 180 entities to deploy broadband to 5.2 million unserved homes and businesses. The FCC said that ""99.7 percent of these locations will be receiving broadband with speeds of at least 100/20Mbps, with an overwhelming majority (over 85 percent) getting gigabit-speed broadband."" The funding is going to a mix of cable, fiber, and fixed wireless providers, plus SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.The most recent FCC broadband deployment report said that, as of year-end 2019, 95.6 percent of Americans had access to fixed broadband with speeds of at least 25Mbps downstream and 3Mbps upstream. Deployment at higher speeds is more limited, especially in rural and tribal areas. For example, the report said that 250/25Mbps speeds are available to 87.2 percent of people nationwide, 55.6 percent of people in rural areas, and 49.6 percent of tribal residents.Those data points likely undercount the number of unserved Americans because the FCC lets ISPs count an entire census block as served even if it can serve just one home in the block. The commission plans to collect geospatial maps from ISPs to make the data more accurate.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

44,"Cyber spies fall short on protecting Canadians' privacy after breaches, says new report",Security,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cse-privacy-nsira-1.5939001,"Canada's foreign signals intelligence agency has been falling short when it comes to containing the damage done by privacy breaches, says a new report from the intelligence sector watchdog.The findings are found in a redacted report from the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA) looking into reported breaches of Canadians' privacy by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). The report was made public this week. The CSE gathers foreign signals intelligence — or SIGINT, to use the intelligence sector's term for it. Its mandate specifically limits it to monitoring online activity abroad. The agency also has been tasked with protecting critical government infrastructure from hackers and state-sponsored attacks.Given the sensitive nature of its work, CSE has to catalogue every incident of its activities putting the privacy of Canadians, or of any individual in Canada, at risk.The watchdog agency wrote that it understands privacy incidents are unavoidable due to the nature of CSE's work, but it flagged problems with the way CSE treats breaches — and warned that there's nothing stopping systemic incidents from reoccurring unless changes are made.""The mitigation, documentation and reporting of privacy incidents was inconsistent and did not always meet the transparency and accountability objectives set out in CSE internal policy,"" said the NSIRA report.""Moreover, incidents were not always assessed with a view to determining the impact on lawfulness and/or the privacy of Canadians.""CSE-watcher and Citizen Lab Research fellow Bill Robinson said the report shows that the spy agency isn't doing enough to clean up after it makes a mistake that leads to a privacy breach.""We're talking about when they make mistakes and information about average Canadians ends up getting reported by them, or otherwise gets into people's inboxes or ... where it shouldn't be,"" he said.""And then, what do they do when they find out about that and how do they try to prevent that from happening? And the report suggests they're not doing a very good job of that.""It's kind of a damning report for CSE.""While many details are blacked out in the report, NSIRA said it observed incidents of data containing Canadian identity information being incorrectly shared, and of foreign intelligence products created through inadvertent targeting of Canadians. CSE would cancel or delete the information without checking to see of the information had been used, said the report.""Cancelling a SIGINT product, in NSIRA's opinion, is insufficient to mitigate the potential harm arising from inadvertently including Canadian information within a report,"" said the report.'While the potential harm is limited from the moment the report is cancelled, information with a Canadian privacy interest might still have been used prior to the product's cancellation.""That failure to follow up could have real consequences, said Robinson.""They don't check on asking what they've done with the information, which could be putting somebody on a no-fly list. Or it could be putting them on a 'kill them with a drone' list in the worst case,"" he said.A spokesperson for CSE said the agency has either implemented or is in the middle of introducing policy changes and technical fixes to address privacy incidents going forward.""We have accepted NSIRA's recommendation to modify and update our approach on reporting on privacy incidents, so that an incident report is completed for every incident with a Canadian privacy interest,"" said Evan Koronewski in a statement to CBC News.""CSE's operational policies establish specific measures to protect the privacy of Canadians and persons in Canada in the acquisition, use and retention of information. To ensure our staff understand and abide by our operational policies, we regularly train, test, and verify their knowledge and compliance.""NSIRA said the number of breach incidents has nearly doubled over the previous year. It said CSE's failure to assess these incidents amounts to a ""gap in responsibility"" for the spy agency.Koronewski said some of the incidents CSE self-identified were simple errors.""CSE's robust and layered approach to privacy protection contributes to an operational environment resulting in a relatively small number of inadvertent privacy incidents,"" said Koronewski.""Some of these incidents are unfortunately a result of simple errors, which requires information to be updated and/or corrected.""As part of its the review, the oversight body's staff reviewed incident files between July 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019 involving information about a person or business in Canada that was handled in a manner counter to CSE's mandate, and cases involving a Canadian or a person in Canada involving the Five Eyes alliance. It also looked at cases where CSE improperly handled information about a Canadian or a person in Canada — but the information was kept from leaking out.Leah West, a former federal lawyer turned assistant professor on national security issues at Carleton University, said cases involving allies instead of adversaries do not absolve CSE of responsibility.West cited the case of Maher Arar. The engineer was detained by the U.S. in 2002 and deported to Syria, where he was tortured and interrogated on false terrorism allegations. A judicial inquiry found the RCMP had given misleading information to U.S. authorities.""We just have to look at the Maher Arar incident to see where information can be shared with an ally about a Canadian that has significant implications for that Canadian once they're outside our jurisdiction. So it's not that this stuff doesn't matter,"" she said.""There was a lot of stuff in this report that made me question how much is being done here for purely for the sake of compliance, rather than the deeper understanding of the trust that we put in CSE to be able to collect this information and to keep that information safe, and to collect only that information that it's absolutely necessary, especially when it comes to information that impacts the privacy of Canadians.""CSE's privacy issues were also flagged in NSIRA's annual report late last year.To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

45,Which internet speed test should you use to test your connection at home?,Networking/Telecom,https://www.cnet.com/news/which-internet-speed-test-should-you-use-to-test-your-connection-at-home/,"Curious to see what your actual internet speeds look like? An internet speed test is just what you need -- here are the ones we recommend.Many internet users assume that the speed on their home internet package is what they get on a consistent, daily basis, but that isn't always the case. Speeds typically fluctuate throughout the day, and can slow down during times of peak usage. And if your provider enforces data caps or throttles connections to maintain overall network performance, your speeds could come crashing down, too.There is an easy way to keep an eye on your home's internet speeds, and that's with an internet speed test. You've got lots of free options online to choose from, and might even be able to run one from the same app that you used to set up your router. In most cases, running a test is as easy as pressing ""Go.""Read more: Best VPN service of 2021A good speed test will make it easy to see the current download speeds, upload speeds and latency (or ping) for whatever device you're running the test on -- but with so many options promising to do exactly that, which one should you trust? Glad you asked -- here are the ones we turn to first, and why:One of our favorites is the Ookla speed test, which has a strong reputation for consistency, and for being one of the first speed tests on the web. Popularity aside, we like Ookla for having everything a basic user needs from a speed test: accuracy, the ability to view your speed test history (when you create an account), a wide array of servers to connect to, and even a handy app for speed testing from your Android or iOS device. Ookla's also done a good job of keeping up with the times by adding new features and capabilities over the years. Just recently, the service released a video-specific speed test that measures your network's ability to handle 4K video streams. It also has apps that you can run on Windows, and on an Apple TV.All of that said, Ookla does display banner ads while you run basic speed tests. That's not surprising, but it might make a slight impact on your results depending on the strength of your connection at the time of the test.Fast.com is a another great broadband test, and the interface is about as simple and straightforward as it gets. However, one of its biggest advantages is that it's owned by Netflix. That might seem odd at first, but it's actually what makes it a great pick for online streamers, because the test is structured around checking to see if your connection is strong enough to stream Netflix in maximum resolution without buffering.While Fast.com is a great tool for some, it won't be the most helpful test for all users. The basic interface is easy to use, yes, but it also lacks some of the advanced settings and metrics you'll find with other speed tests. Most notably, you can't specify which server you'd like to connect with for your test.If you're looking for a test that offers a look not just at speeds, but at consistency, Speedof.me is the way to go. Similar to Ookla, the test interface does a great job of showing fluctuations in your upload and download speeds. Over time, that can make it easier to spot when something is amiss with your connection, especially since Speedof.me lets you compare your results with previous tests. Its mobile-friendly website is great for running tests on your phone, too, allowing you to do a quick speed test on the go without downloading an app. Speedof.me isn't a perfect option, though. For starters, there's no option for manually selecting which server you connect with. And if home networking isn't your forte, the visualized data might seem more confusing or overwhelming than something like Fast.com, which just gives you a number.Testmy.net is an internet speed test that runs entirely on HTML5 and PHP. What that means is that it doesn't require third-party software like Java or Flash to run your test, which can make for more accurate results. That also makes it a useful tool for comparing performance between different browsers. You can also create an account to track your internet speed for future reference or comparison. It's not the most user-friendly tool, however. With a good deal of in-depth data, you'll have quite a bit of information to look through, much of which might not be relevant to you. The design is also a little ugly by speed test standards, and it takes a few clicks before you actually begin a test, which obviously isn't as streamlined as other speed tests that feature big ""Go"" buttons as soon as you load the page.Get smart home reviews and ratings, video reviews, buying guides, prices and comparisons from CNET."
46,Alphabet’s moonshot lab is working on a device to give people superhuman hearing,Biotechnology,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313421/alphabet-project-x-wolverine-hearing-aid-project,"Filed under:Codenamed project ‘Wolverine’Alphabet has attempted to take on some wild projects over the years, like a crop-sniffing plant buggy and fish-tracking cameras. But now, its X lab is working on a device that could give people superhuman hearing. As Insider first reported, the project, codenamed “Wolverine,” is exploring the future of hearing through sensor-packed hardware. The team, members of which spoke to Insider anonymously, say they’re currently trying to figure out how to isolate people’s voices in a crowded room or make it easier to focus on one person when overlapping conversations are happening around you.They’ve already iterated on the device multiple times, including devices that covered the whole ear and others that protruded from above the ear. These iterations have been large because the team incorporates lots of microphones into the build, but newer versions are smaller, Insider says. Multiple people from hearing technology companies have joined the team, including talent from Starkey Hearing Technologies and Eargo. Insider says the Wolverine team’s goals most closely align to that of Whisper, a company that came out of stealth last year. That team has managed to isolate sounds through a “sound separation engine,” which adapts to wearers’ environments. This suggests the lab’s goal isn’t to just create a device everyone would want, but rather an enhanced hearing aid.Alphabet’s team isn’t focused on just one device or one use case, Insider says. The team is looking to build a successful business with multiple devices and models, so if they’re successful, you might start wearing Google-owned hearing aids.A newsletter about computers"
47,"More than 20,000 U.S. organizations compromised through Microsoft flaw: source",Security,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-microsoft/more-than-20000-u-s-organizations-compromised-through-microsoft-flaw-source-idUSKBN2AX23U,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Joseph Menn, Raphael Satter, Trevor Hunnicutt4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 20,000 U.S. organizations have been compromised through a back door installed via recently patched flaws in Microsoft Corp’s email software, a person familiar with the U.S. government’s response said on Friday.The hacking has already reached more places than all of the tainted code downloaded from SolarWinds Corp, the company at the heart of another massive hacking spree uncovered in December.The latest hack has left channels for remote access spread among credit unions, town governments and small businesses, according to records from the U.S. investigation.Tens of thousands of organizations in Asia and Europe are also affected, the records show.The hacks are continuing despite emergency patches issued by Microsoft on Tuesday.Microsoft, which had initially said the hacks consisted of “limited and targeted attacks,” declined to comment on the scale of the problem on Friday but said it was working with government agencies and security companies to provide help to customers.It added, “impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.”One scan of connected devices showed only 10% of those vulnerable had installed the patches by Friday, though the number was rising.Because installing the patch does not get rid of the back doors, U.S. officials are racing to figure out how to notify all the victims and guide them in their hunt.All of those affected appear to run Web versions of email client Outlook and host them on their own machines, instead of relying on cloud providers. That may have spared many of the biggest companies and federal government agencies, the records suggest.The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.Microsoft and the person working with the U.S. response blamed the initial wave of attacks on a Chinese government-backed actor. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions.What started as a controlled attack late last year against a few classic espionage targets grew last month to a widespread campaign. Security officials said that implied that unless China had changed tactics, a second group may have become involved.More attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.The hackers have only used the back doors to re-enter and move around the infected networks in a small percentage of cases, probably less than 1 in 10, the person working with the government said.“A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can,” stealing data and installing other ways to return later, he said.The initial avenue of attack was discovered by prominent Taiwanese cyber researcher Cheng-Da Tsai, who said he reported the flaw to Microsoft in January. He said in a blog post that he was investigating whether the information leaked.He did not respond to requests for further comment.Reporting by Raphael Satter and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Rosalba O’BrienOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

What do SolarWinds, Fidelis, FireEye, Microsoft, Mimecast, Palo Alto Networks, and Qualys all have in common? Each and every one were victims of the SolarWinds software supply chain attack. There are more, many more. The Russian government's hack of SolarWinds's proprietary software, Orion network monitoring program, ruined top government agencies' and tech companies' security. Months after it was first revealed, we're still trying to get our arms around just how bad the breach was.That's in no small part because while the Orion platform exploits were more than bad enough, the hacker group, widely believed to be Russian government-affiliated Cozy Bear, also used that breach to distribute malware such as Sunburst. Other programs, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Active Directory, were also used in the global attacks. Indeed, Brandon Wales, acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that almost a third of the victims hadn't been running SolarWinds Orion at all.  It's the security breach that just keeps on breaching. You don't have to take my word for it. Azeem Aleem, NTT's Global Digital Forensics and Incident Response Lead, said, ""There is no end to the fallout in sight. In addition, organizations must consider that more threat actors are likely to mimic the SolarWinds incident, given the success of the attack."" Indeed, the FBI believes a Chinese hacking group has already taken advantage of another SolarWinds security hole to launch attacks.So how bad is it? Tom Kelly, president and CEO of IDX, a leading provider of identity protection and digital privacy services, fears that, ""On a scale of 1-10, the SolarWinds hack was definitely a 10. It however could even turn out to be a ""bigger 10"" before the dust settles. We are likely to learn more about its scope and impact over the next few months.""What do SolarWinds, Fidelis, FireEye, Microsoft, Mimecast, Palo Alto Networks, and Qualys all have in common?

It however could even turn out to be a ""bigger 10"" before the dust settles. We are likely to learn more about its scope and impact over the next few months.""Kelly's far from the only security expert who thinks we still don't appreciate just how bad this attack has been. Jonathan Moore, CTO of the cybersecurity firm, SpiderOak, said, ""It's much bigger than the headlines make it appear. While hackers used the SolarWinds Orion product to gain a foothold on networks, penetration deeper into victim networks was done by hand with operators at keyboards. These attacks likely involved hundreds, and potentially thousands, of work hours. At this point, the firms investigating the attack have reported that the Russian group actively breached upwards of 300 organizations, with each compromise custom-tailored and hand-executed against the target.""That's not all. Moore continued, ""The public, however, is missing the true scope of this attack. The security crisis we are in has been driven not by one individual company such as SolarWinds, but by negative market incentives that ultimately lead to breaches. From a business perspective, it is not possible to analyze the risk that software products introduce, and security products cannot quantify the reduction in risk they provide. Customers are therefore motivated to spend resources on the portions of their business where risk and rewards are better understood, meeting only the minimum bar in security.""Kelly added, ""The SolarWinds breach has numerous factors that contributed to its extreme seriousness. It used the trusted relationship that organizations have with their IT supply chain, in this case, SolarWinds, in order to avoid detection and broadly distribute the attack. Additionally, it relied on a technical approach that was able to circumvent detection by government cybersecurity efforts. Lastly, it took a very patient approach to exfiltrating information in order to reside and operate undetected for many months in organizations' networks.""ThreatWarrior's, a security company specializing in network and supply-chain threat detection, CTO & Chief Scientist Pete Slade, said ""The SolarWinds hack could definitely be thought of as ‘IT’s Pearl Harbor.’""The worst was still to come. Unlike most programs, which attack immediately and cause visible damage, Slade continued, ""The malware lay dormant for two weeks, evaluating its environment and blending in to evade detection. This attack was impressive in its approach and scale, and we’re still learning about its extent even beyond SolarWinds. CISOs everywhere have now woken up to the fact that they can no longer trust their security supply chain, and they’re looking for a solution to that problem. It’s a grim realization that trust itself has become the attack surface and our most trusted solutions require the same level of scrutiny as our least.""Karen Walsh, cybersecurity compliance expert and Allegro Solutions CEO worries, ""The SolarWinds security breach is the Three Mile Island of cybersecurity because it highlights the long term consequences."" Walsh explained, ""It's important to understand the difference between ""Sunburst"" and ""Supernova."" Supernova was a malware installed using a vulnerability in the Orion platform, not a malicious code embedded within the builds. The real concern is Sunburst.""Why? Walsh explained, The January 29th SolarWinds Security Advisory for Sunburst said the ""cyberattack to our systems that inserted a vulnerability (SUNBURST) within our Orion Platform software builds."" Walsh continued, ""It’s important to emphasize that the vulnerability was inserted within the builds because that implies manual touches that compromised the product itself, not just a code that you end up downloading to your own devices or systems. Sunburst is analogous to the Three Mile Island station meltdown, a single disastrous event. Supernova is the continued ecosystem contamination that comes afterward. Because Supernova's certificates looked legitimate, the supply stream contamination seeped into the ecosystem undetected.""Walsh continued, ""Finally, to conclude the analogy, you will have organizations finding indications of compromise for a long time, never really knowing whether it was from the SolarWinds hack or something else. A good example of this would be the alert from Microsoft that someone had viewed the code but not changed it. Three to five years from now, an organization might notice something similar but not be able to confidently attribute it to Sunburst and Supernova. This, then, is similar to the Three Mile Island cancer clusters. We will be tracking the cancerous outcomes of the SolarWinds hack for years, possibly over a decade. Many analysts think that we won’t even realize the full impact for at least five years. So, while it’s tempting to argue that this is 'another example of poor security,' this particular hack is far more insidious and sophisticated.""As bad as it is, Patrick Kelley, Critical Path Security's CTO worries this attack was just the tip of the iceberg. ""This attack hasn’t been as significant as it really could have been. I personally feel that this was testing of the waters. Future attacks on supply chains will include ransomware and larger impacts. Imagine if 18,000 government agencies were hit with ransomware at the exact same time. That is the direction that I really believe this is going."" Isn't that a thought to make you feel all warm and cozy on a cold winter's night?But, wait there's more. Sachin Bansal, the General Counsel at SecurityScorecard, observed, ""The scariest is what we don't know about this attack (e.g., impact to government systems and/or critical infrastructure), and we won't know that for a while, and that should be very concerning.""Bansai added, ""This is a supply chain attack, and the concerns about software and hardware supply chain that some may have viewed as theoretical have now been put in very real and stark terms. What other supply chain attacks have occurred since SolarWinds, i.e., how many other SolarWinds are out there? SolarWinds is like a new pandemic -- a contagion incident that is evolving.""Another way of looking at the breach, and just as disturbing in its own way was expressed by  Dr. David Brumley, Professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and co-founder and CE of ForAllSecure ""We need to acknowledge SolarWinds is the equivalent of a high-class cat burglar, a Moriarty, or an Arsene Lupin. The SolarWinds attack was methodical, careful, and well-done. It’s a sign that nation-states are investing tremendous resources into cyberattacks, and it’s working.""Oh, and by the way, Brumley continued, ""There isn’t going to be a silver bullet. No one did anything 'wrong' here. Sure, processes can be improved. We can get better. But this doesn’t strike me as negligence or a lack of security. Sometimes the attacker just wins, at least temporarily.""Besides the actual damage caused by the attacks, cloud data integration and data integrity Talend's CISO Anne Hardy, observed, this is a ""real wakeup call for taking cybersecurity action. It's raised large concerns for CISOs and other security professionals – mainly, a lack of visibility and understanding of the vulnerabilities among our suppliers. The SolarWinds hack caused a disruptive violation of trust between vendors. I am concerned with the lack of visibility down our supply chain. We can manage our vendors, but how do they manage their own suppliers? Several companies were indirectly affected because their suppliers were themselves directly or indirectly affected. Until the SolarWinds case, most companies did not ask their vendors about their own suppliers. This will clearly change.""That said, Rajesh Khazanchi, co-founder and EVP of ColorTokens, a Zero Trust security company, observed in Sonatype's 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain report the ""next-generation supply chain attacks have surged by 430% in the past year. As the adversaries are getting craftier and imposing an unprecedented level of risks, the world should look to specialized coverage indispensable to cybersecurity protection against evolving cyber-attacks.""Indeed, it's not like software supply chain security wasn't a known issue. As Prakash Linga, software supply chain company BluBracket's CEO said when the company was launched in 2020--ironically about the same time SolarWinds software was being opened up like an oyster--CIOs, CTOs, and  CISOs often can't answer such simple questions as where is their code, who has access to it, and where did it come from?Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation executive director and BluBracket board member said, we've ""seen traditional models and tools struggle to keep up with the pace set by developers and DevOps. Code security that respects developers' productivity is a critical need for companies who see software as the foundation of their competitive advantage.""How do you do that? The Linux Foundation has some ideas on how to secure the software supply chain while keeping today's hyper-fast continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pace. First, David A. Wheeler, the Linux Foundation's Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security, explained that in the Orion attack that the malicious code was added by subverting the program's build environment.This neatly defeated the usual standard security advice:So, what's the fix? In the long run, Wheeler thinks there's only one true answer for this kind of attack: Verified reproducible builds. These are ones ""that always produces the same outputs given the same inputs so that the build results can be verified. A verified reproducible build is a process where independent organizations produce a build from source code and verify that the built results come from the claimed source code.""Lovely idea, and we'll get there eventually, but today almost no programs are verifiable. The Linux Foundation and Civil Infrastructure Platform has been funding work, including the Reproducible Builds project, to make verified reproducible builds achievable.In the meantime, Khazanchi suggests you use the following mitigation strategies to defend against further risks from this and other sophisticated cyber attacks.Khazanchi concluded, ""Applying security hygiene and east-west segmentation along with endpoint and server hardening can be effective techniques to reign in spiraling complex segments that promote unseen lateral movement. Such attacks depend on network complexity and lack of east-west controls to move laterally from system to system. Micro-segmentation that automatically prevents communication between systems that do not otherwise communicate significantly reduces the propagation possible via lateral movement.""Finally, using open-source software can be helpful. As Eric S. Raymond, an open source founder, famously described 'Linus’s Law' as ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" Open source isn't a cure-all by any means. But, at least you can see for yourself the code, which might be causing you trouble if you're worried.There are programs such as Red Hat‘s Release Monitoring, nvchecker, or Replogy which can help you spot what's new in your open-source software. Other third-party code analysis programs Synopsys’s Black Duck or Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle can help.Another Linux Foundation project, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF),   combines forces with the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), GitHub’s Open Source Security Coalition, and open-source security-conscious companies Its goal, said Mark Russinovich, Microsoft Azure’s CTO is to help developers better understand the security threats that exist in the open-source software ecosystem.The Foundation's four goals are: 1) Help developers to spot security problems, 2) Provide the best security tools for open source developers, 3) Give them best practice recommendations; and 4) Create an open-source software ecosystem where the time to fix a vulnerability and deploy that fix across the ecosystem is measured in minutes, not months.These are all works in progress. In the meantime, all we can do is to keep our eyes on our software supply chains. Few of us are used to doing that, but after SolarWinds, it's clear that we must do so. As so many experts said, as bad as it's been, it could have been much worse. Indeed, it may yet prove to be much worse.Let's take care and be safe out there.Steven J.

49,Japanese billionaire is looking for eight people to join him for a Moon voyage on SpaceX rocket,Space,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex,"Filed under:Yusaku Maezawa announces a new contest to ride on a SpaceX shipJapanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa invited the public on Tuesday to apply for a spot on SpaceX’s Starship in his private mission around the Moon, reaching out to a “wider, more diverse audience” two years after announcing he’d only ride with a select group of artists. The trip is currently slated for 2023, but that date might not hold. “I want people from all kinds of backgrounds to join,” Maezawa said in a video posted Tuesday afternoon, when the contest’s application went live. “It will be 10 to 12 people in all, but I will be inviting 8 people to come along on the ride.”Maezawa, the founder of Japan’s largest online fashion retailer, is worth about $2 billion. He was revealed as Starship’s first signed passenger back in 2018 during an event with CEO Elon Musk at SpaceX’s California headquarters. At the event, Maezawa, an avid art collector, announced his Dear Moon Project, which aimed to bring “six to eight artists from around the world” to join him in a roughly six-day lunar flyby mission sometime in 2023. “These artists will be asked to create something after they return to Earth, and these masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,” Maezawa said at the time.In a YouTube video posted on Tuesday, Maezawa said that plan “has since evolved,” adding that “maybe every single person is doing something creative could be called an artist.”Now, anyone who meets two criteria could get picked for the ride: those who “can push its envelope to help other people and greater society in some way” and are “willing to support other crew members who share similar aspirations.”Project updates have been scant over the past two years. In January 2020, Maezawa launched a bizarre campaign to search for a “female partner” who would accompany him on his trip around the Moon. A website for the contest received 27,722 applications, and Japanese streaming service AbemaTV was set to document the mission in a reality TV show called Full Moon Lovers. Weeks later, the show was canceled, and Maezawa called off his search due to “personal reasons,” he tweeted, apologizing to the AbemaTV crew and all of the applicants.Starship is SpaceX’s next-generation, fully reusable Mars rocket system designed to ferry humans and up to 100 tons of cargo on future missions into deep space. Only early iterations of the rocket have flown so far, with one of two recent high-altitude tests flying as high as 7.8 miles over SpaceX’s Starship facilities in Boca Chica, Texas. Both of those tests ended in fiery explosions during their landing attempts. Maezawa’s announcement on Tuesday lacked any details on how the selected astronauts would train for the mission, but he made clear the undisclosed ticket price is on him: “I will pay for the entire journey. I have bought all the seats, so it will be a private ride.” He said it will take three days to get to the Moon, where Starship will loop behind it and begin its three-day journey back to Earth.Under a rigorous and sometimes bumpy development timeline, Musk and SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell have said Starship’s first orbital flight could come at the end of 2021. Last year, Musk said Starship needs to “do hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board,” a feat that calls the 2023 moonshot date into question. SpaceX’s other crew vehicle, Crew Dragon, is already in its operational phase and is racking up future flights with private astronauts and tourists. The acorn-shaped capsule flew its first two crews of astronauts to the International Space Station last year under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The private astronaut missions lined up include a flight to the space station planned for early next year carrying real estate investors and philanthropists, and an “all-civilian” charity-focused mission announced last month that’s slated for launch by year’s end.A newsletter about computers"

Experts think it would be a good feature to quickly catch mistakes before putting tweets out to the public, but say it isn't the game-changer that an edit button would be.Jane Manchun Wong, a social media and website feature researcher, tweeted on March 4 that the social media giant is working on the feature and added a video of what the undo feature would look like.In an email, Twitter Canada said it is testing this feature but did not indicate when it might be released.Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) March 5, 2021Wong says this is far from an edit button.“This [user interface] implies that Twitter prefers sticking with not providing the full editing capability, but addressing the use cases of why users might want the editing capability,” she told Yahoo Finance Canada.Wong added that the undo feature is a “good compromise to address the need of quickly fixing typos without introducing all sorts of complexities related to tweet editing.”Ramona Pringle, a tech expert and associate professor at Ryerson University, says the feature is fundamentally different than an edit button.“If someone said something they should be held accountable for that and that’s where there’s been a lot of controversy around the notion of an edit button,” she said in an interview. “But something like this is not about saying you didn’t say something... but it pushes you to take a few moments and think about what you’ve done.”She said because so much of social media is tied to the speed of the timeline with a sense of urgency, it’s made people tweet without thinking about what they’re tweeting.“[This feature] gives us a little bit more power over the timeline and the pace of the timeline,” she said, adding that it’s very similar to the unsend button that Google enabled for Gmail. However, Pringle said that this isn’t a breakthrough feature.Richard Lachman, an expert on tech user experience and associate professor at Ryerson University, agrees with Pringle and added that this is one small feature in Twitter changing their business model.“Twitter is figuring out how an advertising-based model is maybe pushing it in directions that are challenging truth, challenging the kind of conversations that have happened, and this is a way of trying to build some professionalization features into Twitter to really appeal to people who might be looking at social-based models as opposed to advertising,” he said.“This particular button is not a major story. It’s not really in the set of features I would want to see if Twitter is to become a more mature conversational platform that’s not filled with anger, filled with vitriol.”The daily grind under Darryl Sutter is hard, Milan Lucic said.

Jordi Alba drilled a shot from a tight angle past goalkeeper Sergio Herrera in the 30th minute after Messi played him clear down the left flank with a chipped pass behind the defensive line. It was the defender’s fifth goal of the season. Substitute Ilaix Moriba put the result beyond doubt with seven minutes left. The 18-year-old midfielder, who debuted two weeks ago, scored his first goal for the team when he took a pass from Messi and drilled the ball into the corner of the net. Marc-Andre ter Stegen made two saves for Barcelona in the first half when Osasuna threatened on the counterattack. Barcelona extended its undefeated run to 16 league matches to keep the pressure on Atlético a day before it hosts third-place Real Madrid in a Spanish capital derby. Atlético will also have one more game to play after this round. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Joseph Wilson, The Associated PressThe NBA is expecting arenas to be filled again next season and a return to its normal calendar, Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday, while cautioning again that every plan is contingent on continued progress in the ongoing fight against the coronavirus. There are no plans for the league to travel overseas next season for exhibitions or regular-season games, Silver said, meaning recent preseason trips to foreign markets such as China, Japan or India won’t be repeated until 2022 at the earliest. But otherwise, things may largely appear back to normal — with the NBA eyeing a return to the 82-game schedule, starting in October and ending in June. “I’m fairly optimistic, at this point, that we will be able to start on time,” Silver said from Atlanta, in his annual news conference that precedes the All-Star Game. “Roughly half our teams have fans in their arenas right now and, if vaccines continue on the pace they are and they continue to be as effective as they have been against the virus and its variants, we’re hopeful that we’ll have relatively full arenas next season as well.” The league had 171 games cancelled last season because of the pandemic — one of the reasons for revenue projections being missed by about $1.5 billion — and this season will be at least 150 games below the usual total, with more significant financial losses certain. All teams are scheduled to play 72 games instead of the customary 82, with only about half the league admitting any fans and those that have opened their doors doing so for just a small percentage of normal capacity. “Last season and this season has required a significant investment on the part of the team owners,"" Silver said. “They accept that. Players will end up taking a reduction in salary this season because they are partners with the league and teams on revenue. League executives, team executives have all taken haircuts on their salary. But I think when we all step back, we all feel very fortunate to be working under these circumstances and my sense is the players feel the same way."" Silver’s news conference was virtual this season for the first time, done over Zoom — like virtually all other league business this year — because of the pandemic and the league’s protocols for health and safety. A year ago at All-Star weekend in Chicago, about a month before the NBA’s decision on March 11, 2020, to suspend the season following the news that Utah’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, Silver warned there was “a major national, if not global, health crisis” looming with regard to the virus. What Silver said might not have sounded many alarms at that time. Less than a month later, the virus began dominating every aspect of life across the globe — and has continued to since. “One thing we've all come to understand over the last year is that the virus is firmly in charge,"" Silver said. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Tim Reynolds, The Associated PressNEWARK, N.J. — Ryan Strome scored twice and streaking New York Rangers beat the Devils 6-3 Saturday, sending New Jersey to its fifth straight loss and eighth in nine games. Adam Fox, Ryan Strome, Kevin Rooney Libor Hajek and Filip Chytil also scored as the Rangers won their third straight and sixth in eight games. Alexandar Georgiev had 24 saves while filling in for the injured Igor Shesterkin, who sustained a groin injury in a 6-1 win over New Jersey Thursday night. P.K. Subban and Mikhail Maltsev scored in a 17-second first-period span to give the slumping Devils some hope after falling behind 2-0. The hope lasted less than two minutes. Rooney, a former Devil who signed with New York this season, capped a 2-on-1 with Chytil flipping a cross-ice pass over Mackenzie Blackwood for a 3-2 lead. Hajek stretched the lead to two goals 65 seconds in the second period with a short that deflected off Devils forward Janne Kuokkanen. It was his first point of the season and first goal since getting his first in the NHL against New Jersey on Mar. 9, 2019. Chytil scored in close in the third period as the Rangers scored 12 goals in sweeping the two games against their Hudson River rivals. Nathan Bastian closed the gap to 5-3, but Strome iced the game with an empty net goal. The Rangers caught a break early when Devils defenceman Sami Vatanen was called for a double minor for high sticking 1:33 into the contest. Fox gave New York the lead 33 second later scoring on a length of the ice rush. Strome got his seventh of the year in close after a turnover in the Devils' end. Subban closed the gap to 2-1 with a point shot at 14:54 and Maltsev tied the game in close at 15:11. HORRIBLE HOME The Devils are 2-9-1 at home after losing all five games on the stand that ended Saturday. The last time they lost five straight at home was 2000-01 when they dropped six in a row early. Remarkably, they went to the Cup Final that year and lost to Colorado in seven games.

Semyon Varlamov made 20 saves as the Islanders improved to 9-0-2 at Nassau Coliseum this season and 14-6-4 overall. Cal Clutterbuck, Brock Nelson and Anders Lee also scored. New York beat Buffalo for the fifth straight time this season, outscoring the Islanders 19-7 in those five meetings. The teams meet again Sunday for their third game in four days in the same venue. Buffalo dropped its sixth straight game. Sam Reinhart and Jacob Bryson scored for the Sabres, and Carter Hutton made 24 saves. Bryson put Buffalo in front when he scored his first career goal 33 seconds into his sixth game. The 23-year-old Bryson was selected by the Sabres in the fourth round of the 2017 draft. But the Islanders responded with four goals in the second, including a memorable play by the speedy Barzal. The 23-year-old Barzal tied it at 3:51 with his ninth of the season. After outmuscling Sabres defenceman Rasmus Ristolainen for the puck, Barzal hesitated in front of the net and then backhanded the puck between his legs to himself before sliding it past Hutton. Barzal has three goals and four assists in the last six games. Brock Nelson made it 2-1 at 5:16, taking a cross-ice pass from Anthony Beauvillier and firing a high shot past Hutton for his seventh goal. Cal Clutterbuck extended the lead at 8:45, sending a wrist shot past Hutton for his second goal this season. Mayfield made it 4-1 with his second goal of the season at 15:29, firing another high shot past Hutton. Reinhart scored his team-best ninth goal 52 seconds into the third on the power play before Lee added his team-leading 11th goal at 2:15.

If the Jayhawks look outside, a current AAC coach might be the surest thing.They're grown men playing professional hockey now, but when Bonnie O'Reilly's boys were growing up in Seaforth, Ont., Graham Nesbitt was a local legend. As manager of the local arena in the community of about 3,000 people, located an hour north of London, Nesbitt would open the doors on snow days or after regular hours so scores of local kids could skate. ""They'd call and say, 'Is there any way we can get onto the ice before school?'"" recalls Graham's son, Joe Nesbitt. ""He'd have the arena open at 6:30 a.m. so people could skate. He just wanted kids to be active and busy, not getting into trouble. It was his outlet as a kid and he wanted to pass it on."" Both of O'Reilly's sons went on to play in the NHL. Ryan is the captain of the St. Louis Blues, and after winning the Stanley Cup with the team in 2019, he brought it back to Seaforth and nearby Goderich. Her other son, Cal, played for a few different NHL teams and is currently with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League. Now, for the guy who helped give her sons and other kids a bit of extra ice time, O'Reilly has given the assist of a lifetime. On Wednesday, she donated one of her kidneys to Nesbitt, who is 65. The transplant surgery took place in London, and both Nesbitt and O'Reilly are recovering well. The St. Louis Blues shared a photo on social media of Nesbitt and O'Reilly giving the thumbs up from adjacent hospital beds. On Thursday, Pam Nesbitt, Graham's wife, expressed her gratitude on Facebook. ""From our family to you and yours Bonnie, thanks for the gift of a lifetime,"" she said. ""Your selfless act means more than you'll ever know."" Nesbitt retired as Seaforth's arena manager in 2003, going on to work for Olympia Ice Resurfacing and later the Ontario Recreation Facilities Association. He's known all over southwestern Ontario as a good guy to call if your arena ice isn't coming in right or the resurfacing machine goes wonky. 'My dad is just blown away by this' In 2011, Nesbitt was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease. Patients with the disease build up an antibody in the kidneys that over time can limit their ability to filter blood. Medication helped control Nesbitt's condition until 2019, when it became clear he'd need a kidney transplant. Many in the the Seaforth area stepped up for Nesbitt, offering to become donors. Ryan O'Reilly shares the Stanley Cup with his 99-year-old grandmother after winning the NHL championship in 2019. Ryan and his brother, Cal, were often given extra ice time by Nesbitt when they were young players, and on Wednesday, Ryan's mother Bonnie donated a kidney to Nesbitt. (Allison Devereaux/ CBC News ) When O'Reilly was identified as a good match, she agreed to give Nesbitt one of her kidneys. ""She says that 'What you've done for my boys, helping them achieve their goal of playing professional hockey, it's the least we can do,'"" Joe Nesbitt said, quoting O'Reilly. ""My dad is just blown away by this."" To him, the donation is evidence of the special bond that often forms among hockey families. ""Your team growing up, you become more than just a team, you kind of become family,"" Joe Nesbitt said. ""It's kind of left me speechless. ""Something my dad's always taught me is to be kind and helpful and generous to everybody,"" he said. ""It just goes to show that those thoughtful acts and caring for people, it pays off. It truly paid off for my dad and saved his life.""

The Penguins took two of three from the Flyers during Philadelphia's extended stay in Pittsburgh, with McCann providing the difference in the finale when Brandon Tanev's shot smacked off Elliott's pad and ended up on McCann's stick. McCann fired it into the net, then went skates over skull after tripping over Elliott immediately after scoring his fifth of the season. Zach Aston-Reese, Bryan Rust and Evgeni Malkin also scored for Pittsburgh. Tristan Jarry finished with 19 saves as the Penguins pulled back into a tie with the Flyers in the cramped East Division. Travis Konecny, Kevin Hayes and Shayne Gostisbehere scored for the Flyers. Elliott made 23 stops but couldn't beat Pittsburgh for the second time in three days. The longtime rivals expected things to get chippy considering Philadelphia's rare three-game stay in Pittsburgh, a visit Flyers coach Alain Vigneault pointed to as a “gut check” of sorts as the midpoint of the 56-game regular season sprint nears. They split the first two meetings, the Penguins winning 5-2 on Tuesday night even with Crosby out due to COVID-19 protocols. Philadelphia responded with a stirring 4-3 triumph on Thursday in which the Flyers recovered and at times dominated after spotting Pittsburgh a three-goal lead during a 71-second span in the first. There was no early deficit this time as they took turns going to the power play and swapping the lead. A turnover by Pittsburgh's Sam Lafferty created a two-on-none for the Flyers, with Konecny burying a shot into an empty net. The Penguins responded with a pair of goals with the man advantage. Malkin's fifth of the season came on a pretty wraparound in which he deked Elliott to his knees, then swooped behind the net to flip it home. Pittsburgh head coach Mike Sullivan has chastised his team for not shooting enough on the power play, but a spectacular passing sequence from Malkin to Crosby to Jake Guentzel to Rust resulted in a tap-in goal that put Pittsburgh up late in the first. Hayes sniped one past Jarry 1:20 into the second to tie it and Gostisbehere gave Voracek his 500th career assist when his long shot from the point threaded through traffic by Jarry to give the Flyers the lead just past the game's midway point. Aston-Reese, however, drew Pittsburgh even when his innocuous flick from the goal line in the corner slipped by Elliott to produce another taut third period. UP NEXT Flyers: Welcome the Washington Capitals to the Wells Fargo Center on Sunday. A limited number of fans will be allowed in, the first time Philadelphia will play in front of a home crowd since a 2-0 loss to Boston on March 10, 2020.

Federal prosecutors unsealed a case against McAfee and his executive advisor and bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr., claiming the pair earned nearly $2 million by urging Twitter followers to invest in cryptocurrencies like Reddcoin and Dogecoin, then selling off their own holdings as the price rose.“McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,” said US Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement. “The defendants allegedly used McAfee’s Twitter account to publish messages to hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers touting various cryptocurrencies through false and misleading statements to conceal their true, self-interested motives.”The pair allegedly ran their scheme between December 2017 to October 2018. McAfee used his verified Twitter account, which currently has around 1 million followers, to recommend a “Coin of the Day” or “Coin of the Week.” The indictment says McAfee claimed to have no stake in these altcoins; in reality, McAfee would allegedly buy large quantities beforehand using bitcoin, then offload them again after his followers had driven up the price.McAfee and Watson are facing seven charges, each count carrying between five and 20 years in prison. The criminal charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.McAfee — known for founding the eponymous antivirus company — was already arrested last year on separate tax evasion charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued him in October for fraudulently promoting initial coin offerings or ICOs. And in 2019, a court ordered him to pay $25 million for allegedly ordering the 2012 killing of his neighbor in Belize. (McAfee has denied involvement and refused to pay the funds.)

54,EV rollout will require huge investments in strained U.S. power grids,Transportation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-grids-autos-insight/ev-rollout-will-require-huge-investments-in-strained-u-s-power-grids-idUSKBN2AX18Y,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Nichola Groom, Tina Bellon9 Min Read(Reuters) - During several days of brutal cold in Texas, the city of Austin saw its fleet of 12 new electric buses rendered inoperative by a statewide power outage. That problem will be magnified next year, when officials plan to start purchasing electric-powered vehicles exclusively.The city’s transit agency has budgeted $650 million over 20 years for electric buses and a charging facility for 187 such vehicles. But officials are still trying to solve the dilemma of power interruptions like the Texas freeze.“Redundancy and resiliency when it comes to power is something we have long understood will be an issue,” said Capitol Metro spokeswoman Jenna Maxfield.Austin’s predicament highlights the challenges facing governments, utilities and auto manufacturers as they respond to climate change. More electric cars will require both charging infrastructure and much greater electric-grid capacity. Utilities and power generators will have to invest billions of dollars creating that additional capacity while also facing the challenge of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.Extreme weather events add additional layers of difficulty.“Reliability keeps you awake,” California Energy Commission member Siva Gunda said in an interview.Rolling blackouts during a California heat wave last year prompted the state to direct its utilities to procure emergency generating capacity for this summer and to reform its planning for reserve power.The state plans an aggressive phase-out of sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks by 2035 - which, if achieved, would require vast increases in electric grid capacity. (For a graphic on the extra power that will be needed for electric cars, click tmsnrt.rs/3rhyX4S )Graphic: Estimated U.S. capacity if 66% of all cars are EVs by 2050 -The power and transport sectors combined make up more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Their simultaneous greening is considered critical for the United States - the world's second-largest emitter behind China - to meet its obligations under an international accord to address global warming. (For a graphic on the energy sources that fuel U.S. transportation now, click tmsnrt.rs/387haFR )Graphic: Fossil fuels power the U.S. transportation sector -The goal is to power electric cars with renewable energy rather than the coal and natural gas that currently dominate the U.S. power supply. To realize that vision, electricity from intermittent sources like wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, so that cars can charge overnight or at other times when supply outstrips demand.A model utility with two to three million customers would need to invest between $1,700 and $5,800 in grid upgrades per EV through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. Assuming 40 million EVs on the road, that investment could reach $200 billion.So far, investor-owned companies have plans approved for just $2.6 billion in charging programs and projects, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute.“The electrification of the transportation sector will catch most utilities a little bit off guard,” said Ben Kroposki, director of the Power Systems Engineering Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).The organization estimates that, by 2050, the electrification of transportation and other sectors will require a doubling of U.S. generation capacity.If not managed carefully, the needed investments could saddle consumers with higher energy bills, according to a report last month by California’s utility regulator. Another challenge: lower-income customers often can’t afford to make the upfront investment in electric cars, home batteries and rooftop solar systems that could save them money in the long term.‘CHICKEN AND EGG’ PROBLEMSUtilities are embracing EV sales growth as both a promising new source of revenue and an opportunity to use excess wind and solar power generated at very windy or sunny times when supply exceeds demand.Investments in both the grid and charging infrastructure that are recovered from ratepayers could add between $3 billion and $10 billion in cumulative cash flow to the average utility through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. The forecast also includes potential revenues from new products outside of utilities’ regulated businesses, such as customer fleet routing or charging station maintenance.The revenue opportunity is still nascent, however, with EVs making up less than 2% of all vehicles registered in the United States. And utilities must invest in infrastructure now for consumers to feel secure in their purchase of an EV, said Emily Fisher, general counsel of utility trade group Edison Electric Institute.“There is definitely a chicken-and-egg situation with charging infrastructure,” she said.AUTOMAKERS BET BIG ON EVsMajor U.S. automakers General Motors and Ford have announced large investments in EV development to keep pace with electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc and to prepare for the prospect of tougher emissions regulations. EV share could grow to 15% by 2030, according to U.S. Department of Energy forecasts.The electricity to power all those cars is expected to come primarily from renewable energy sources and natural gas, according to NREL. Even if natural gas generation increases to support electrified transportation, overall emissions are projected to decline, the organization said.Large new investments may pose difficulties for utilities already experiencing weather-related problems. In Texas, many of the companies that would be making those investments face a financial crisis stemming from last month’s cold snap. Utilities and power marketers face billions of dollars in blackout-related charges, and several have filed for bankruptcy.Daimler Trucks, the world’s biggest maker of heavy-duty haulers, plans to sell electric vehicles in Europe, North America and Japan by next year. But the company is grappling with how to charge what will one day become hundreds of thousands of battery-powered trucks, said Daimler Trucks chairman Martin Daum.The need for massive investments in grid infrastructure and charging stations “cannot be underestimated,” Daum said.Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley last week called on U.S. government leaders to support EV sales with favorable regulation and subsidies for the production of batteries and charging infrastructure.But Robert Barrosa, senior director at Volkswagen AG’s Electrify America, which is building out fast-charging stations throughout the nation, said the gradual pace of EV adoption will allow utilities to adapt.“We’re not in a doom-and-gloom situation,” Barrosa said. “We’re not going to 80% battery electric sales overnight...it will be a natural transition.”Barrosa said U.S. energy consumption decreases over the last 20 years, due to efficiency gains in appliances and the transportation sector, mean that the U.S. power system has enough established capacity to support EV growth without the immediate need for big investments. (For a graphic on U.S. power generation and consumption, click tmsnrt.rs/3e5f6SH)Graphic: The U.S. is generating more electricity than it consumes -Utility Xcel Energy said EV adoption would likely not require capacity additions until after 2030, and that near-term investments would mainly be in distribution systems. The company is planning to accommodate 1.5 million electric vehicles in its Midwest and Western service territories by 2030, about 30 times more than its current capability.The utility in December received approval to spend $110 million on electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Colorado, which passed a law in 2019 requiring utilities to develop plans for widespread transportation electrification. The plan is expected to add 65 cents a month to residential customer bills.Electric vehicles - especially commercial ones with large batteries - can help stabilize the grid in the long run by feeding power back into the system during times of peak demand, using chargers that allow electricity to flow in both directions. Passenger cars that sit idle most of the day could one day earn money by feeding power back into the grid with the help of bi-directional chargers, utilities predict.During the Texas outages, some Twitter users said they used their electric vehicles to power their homes. But wider applications of such vehicle-to-grid technology would require larger infrastructure changes and utility involvement.“Planning is going to be more sophisticated,” said Ryan Popple, co-founder of Proterra, which produced some of Austin’s electric buses. “And as vehicle-to-grid becomes more common with our commercial fleets, it’s actually going to make the overall technology even more attractive.”Reporting by Nichola Groom and Tina Bellon; editing by David Gaffen and Brian ThevenotOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Thanks to the pandemic, Americans drove 13 percent fewer miles in 2020 than they did the year before. But the move to telework and lockdowns has not made our roads any safer. In fact, our roads got a lot more dangerous last year, according to preliminary data collected by the National Safety Council. The council estimates that 42,060 people were killed in crashes, an 8 percent increase from 2019. The rise looks even more shocking when normalized—it rose from 1.2 to 1.49 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, a 24 percent increase.The National Safety Council also estimates that just under 4.8 million people were injured seriously enough in road crashes to seek medical help for nonfatal injuries. The cost of all this carnage? A whopping $474.4 billion in deaths, injuries, and property damage.Some states fared better than others. Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming all saw a drop in road deaths, although for some this was less than 5 percent.Meanwhile, deaths rose by more than 15 percent in Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and the District of Columbia.One culprit may well be reckless driving. Throughout 2020, there were frequent reports that traffic police were issuing more speeding tickets, particularly for speeds above 100 mph.For its part, the National Safety Council has some recommendations that seem reasonable, including more equitable implementation of road safety laws and infrastructure improvements, lowering speed limits, banning all drivers from using cellphones (even hands-free) while driving, stricter enforcement of seatbelt laws, and greater use of advanced driver assistance systems where they're known to benefit safety, among others.""It is tragic that in the US, we took cars off the roads and didn't reap any safety benefits,"" said Lorraine M. Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. ""These data expose our lack of an effective roadway safety culture. It is past time to address roadway safety holistically and effectively, and NSC stands ready to assist all stakeholders, including the federal government.""You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

56,"Alabama Amazon warehouse workers speak out on union showdown: ""Time for us to make a stand""",Business,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alabama-amazon-warehouse-workers-union/,"Hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees nationwide are watching one of the most significant unionization drives in a generation. Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Birmingham, Alabama are voting on whether to join a retail workers union, and their colleagues around the country are wondering how that will affect them.In two 12-hour shifts a day, about 5,800 workers at the Bessemer Amazon Fulfillment Center sort, package and ship boxes. They make at least $15 dollars per hour, more than twice the minimum wage. However, some of them told CBS News the company refuses to hear their complaints and frustrations.""Amazon is treating the people disrespectful,"" union organizer Michael Foster told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann. ""They're basically telling the people, if you don't want to abide by the way we work, you can go find another job somewhere else.""Foster had been outside the Alabama warehouse during a shift change, where he had been campaigning for votes since October. According to the union, roughly 85% of the workers at the facility are Black. Most are women. Many complain about grueling work, unsafe conditions and inadequate bathroom and meal breaks. ""We're being treated like we're prisoners who're there to get a job done,"" said Jennifer Bates, a warehouse employee.Her colleague Daryl Richardson said his biggest frustrations were ""job security"" and ""respect and safety, wellbeing,"" adding: ""It is time for us to make a stand. It's time for some changes.""""What the community doesn't realize is what goes on behind the curtain,"" Bates said. ""What are the people going through just to make sure we get our packages?""Frustrated workers contacted the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union. Their push is supported by celebrities like Danny Glover.""We need you to vote 'Yes.' You carry on the spirit and tradition in Alabama that has fought against so many obstacles,"" the actor said.President Joe Biden also weighed in with a two-minute video message, stating that ""Every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union.""But Amazon is fighting the union drive in Alabama — a right-to-work state.In a statement, the company told CBS News, ""If the union vote passes, it will impact everyone at the site and it's important associates understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon.""Amazon workers Dawn Hoag said she will vote no.""I have yet to personally encounter anyone who is pro-union,"" Hoag said. ""I do not see a point in paying somebody to do something I am fully capable to do for myself — and that being advocating.""But the union believes these workers need a voice, and that they'll deliver the votes despite long odds.""If you put enough heart in anything that you do, you can do anything… even in Alabama,"" Michael Foster said. ""We have not been able to organize in Alabama as we wish we could, but things are meant to change.""Voting is currently underway by mail, and will end on March 29. The union believes the vote will be close, and whichever side wins, the loser is likely to challenge the outcome.Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the our 24/7 digital news network.

57,Tesla share price plunge knocks $267bn off market value,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/05/tesla-share-price-market-value,"Decline wipes billions off Elon Musk’s fortune as investors fear firm is vastly overvalued

A sharp decline in Tesla’s share price has wiped more than $250bn (£193bn) off the value of the electric car company, and dragged down the value of an Edinburgh-based investment fund that is one of Tesla’s biggest backers.The shares dropped by 7.5% in early trading in the US on Friday to $575 – setting them on course to close down 16% this week and 35% below their record peak of $883 on 26 January.The decline has knocked $267bn off Tesla’s market value, from $834bn in January to about $567bn. The collapse has also wiped billions from fortune of Elon Musk, the chief executive, who owns about 20% of the shares.Musk, who lost his briefly held title of the world’s richest person last month, has seen his paper fortune drop by $7.5bn so far this year to an estimated $162bn.The fall in Tesla’s shares has been felt hard by UK investors in the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT) and other Baillie Gifford funds, which are big investors in Tesla.SMT was the second-largest faller in the FTSE 100 on Friday, down 6%. Its shares, which rose more than 100% last year powered by Tesla gains, are down 26% from a high in February.Baillie Gifford US Growth Trust was the biggest faller in the FTSE 250 index, down 12%. The trust’s managers began selling down their Tesla shares at the start of the year.SMT halved its weighting in Tesla in January from 8.9% of the fund to 5.1%.Analysts said Tesla’s shares were falling as investors worried that the car company may be vastly overvalued. At the same time rising US bond yields are making companies that pay small dividends unappealing. Tesla has never paid a dividend.Ron Baron, a longtime Tesla investor, revealed on Thursday that he had sold about a quarter of his company’s stake in the electric carmaker. Baron told CNBC that his firm sold 1.8m of its 8m Tesla shares in recent months at an average price of $660. Baron’s firm had bought the shares at $42.34 apiece, according to CNBC.However, Baron said he thought Tesla’s share price would hit $2,000 within a decade. “It was painful selling every single share,” he said. “Their prospects are brighter than they have ever been.”Baron said he had not sold any of the more than 1.1m Tesla shares that he owned personally, and did not plan to. “I’m going to hold it another 10 years at least,” he said. “I told Elon that I would be the last out.”"

61,"Whatever happened to Google Fiber? - After stalled rollouts and a series of setbacks, the future of Google Fiber is hanging on by long, thin strands.",Networking/Telecom,https://www.cnet.com/news/whatever-happened-to-google-fiber/,"After stalled rollouts and a series of setbacks, the future of Google Fiber is hanging on by long, thin strands.If it feels like you've been waiting forever for Google Fiber, you're not alone. It has, after all, been more than a decade since Google's announcement that ""fiber is coming."" To be fair, Google Fiber is long established in some areas. Before temporarily halting fiber expansion in 2016, the company brought service to 11 major US markets. Even in those cities though, Google's internet service didn't reach all, or even most, households, leaving many wondering when and if their neighborhood would be eligible for service. Meanwhile, residents of 34 other metropolitan areas who were teased with the possibility of getting Google Fiber early on are still wondering if it will come to their city at all.So what's going on with Google Fiber?Google representative Kevin Lo speaking at the Provo Convention Center in 2013 to announce that the city had been selected for Google Fiber service.Let's start with where Google Fiber has successfully established service. In addition to Kansas City, Google Fiber's inaugural location, the service is also currently available in Atlanta; Huntsville, Alabama; Orange County, California; Charlotte and the Raleigh/Durham area, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Austin and San Antonio, Texas; Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah.According to the Federal Communications Commission, you'll find the greatest serviceability in cities where Google Fiber got its earliest start -- Kansas City, Austin and Provo. Save for a few unserviced pockets (such as north Austin and the Kansas City suburb of Independence), Google Fiber is available throughout the bulk of these areas. Huntsville also boasts a relatively high service area. Though service came to Huntsville later than other locations, Google Fiber was able to rapidly set up a wide coverage area by piggybacking off of existing municipal fiber-optic networks -- a tactic that may be the key to future expansion efforts.Not all Google Fiber cities see the same widespread coverage, however. In places like Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville and San Antonio, where rollouts began much later and large municipal fiber networks were not as readily available, serviceability is random at best.Get smart home reviews and ratings, video reviews, buying guides, prices and comparisons from CNET.In 2016, before Google Fiber could develop a significant footprint in new markets, the company abruptly announced an immediate ""pause"" on all fiber-optic projects, likely due to high costs. And though it appears the hiatus is over, there is no indication of intent to significantly expand coverage in current Google Fiber markets.On the Charlotte Google Fiber page, for example, the company says it is ""working to bring Google Fiber to more communities in Charlotte"" but makes no mention of where or when service expansions could happen. Perhaps even more discouraging, every Google Fiber city page from Atlanta to Salt Lake City displays the same generic statement. ""We're building on our mission to connect more people to fast, reliable internet in Google Fiber cities across the country,"" a Google spokesperson tells CNET. ""Google Fiber construction teams are actively working to build out our networks in each one of our existing Fiber cities, and we're expanding to new neighboring communities in some of those cities."" Internet customers in these regions and others are eager for more options, especially from a provider like Google Fiber, but the initial costs and hassles of running new fiber lines are likely to prohibit significant further expansion. Running new fiber-optic lines can cost an average of $27,000 per mile, not to mention the required planning and labor that come with it. Had Google Fiber been able to offer widespread gigabit service in major markets before rival ISPs could catch up, the initial costs of running fiber lines may have been well worth it. That ship may have sailed, though, as ISP juggernauts including AT&T Fiber, Spectrum, Verizon Fios and Xfinity now offer gigabit speeds in many of the same markets in which Google Fiber had previously expressed interest. In order to compete, Google Fiber would have to employ more cost-effective methods of delivering service.An example of the ""nanotrenching"" technique Google Fiber installers used in Louisville. The strategy didn't prove effective, and Google ultimately pulled out of the city altogether.In 2017, Google Fiber was cautiously optimistic that a new deployment technique known as ""nanotrenching"" would significantly reduce the costs and efforts associated with laying new fiber lines. The process, which involves laying lines as shallow as two inches below the ground and sheathing them in a rubber-like substance, showed early promise in Louisville, Kentucky, where Google Fiber managed to extend service to much of the area in a matter of months. But when buried lines started popping out of the ground a few short months later, nanotrenching proved to create more problems than it solved, and Google Fiber ultimately pulled out of Louisville altogether. Around the same time, Google Fiber had better luck in San Antonio with a similar installation technique, ""microtrenching,"" which involved burying fiber lines three times deeper than nanotrenching. While this installation method helped prevent another setback like Louisville, it did little to mitigate the costs of laying new fiber lines. The expansion efforts were ultimately short-lived, and much of the San Antonio area still remains unserviced by Google Fiber.Essentially back at square one, Google again scaled back on expanding its wired fiber-optic service and instead focused its efforts on Webpass, a fixed wireless service under the Google Fiber brand. With Webpass, Google uses special radios mounted on the tops of buildings to beam an internet signal over the air.Google Fiber Webpass is offered in Denver, Chicago, Miami, Nashville, Austin, Seattle, and Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco, California. It has all the perks of traditional Google Fiber service, such as competitively priced gigabit plans, free installation, free equipment and no contracts. The catch is that Webpass is only available in buildings equipped to support the service, so if you don't live in an apartment or condo building suited with the right wiring, Webpass isn't an option.Understanding that Webpass cannot meet the needs of everyone, especially those in single-family homes, Google has recently resumed its efforts once more to expand and improve its standard Google Fiber service. In July last year, Google Fiber introduced Des Moines, Iowa, as the first new market for its fiber-to-the-home service in four years. In its press release, Google Fiber acknowledged choosing West Des Moines because much of the needed fiber infrastructure is already in place, allowing it to use the same cost-effective strategy that worked in its Huntsville expansion. This may be the model Google Fiber uses going forward to break into new markets, but there is no word yet as to which additional locations, if any, may be on its radar for the near future.As for further expansion in current markets, Google Fiber recently announced plans to bring service to the Millcreek and South Salt Lake, Utah areas. Customers in the Salt Lake Valley can also look forward to even faster speeds thanks to Google Fiber's new 2 Gbps service, which is also currently available in Atlanta, Austin, Huntsville, Nashville, Orange County, Provo and Raleigh/Durham. The 2-gig plan is one of the best internet deals available, offering download speeds up to 2 Gbps and upload speeds up to 1 Gbps starting at $100 a month with unlimited data, a Wi-Fi 6 router and installation included. We're excited to see signs of new life once again from Google Fiber. But even with these new additions, Google Fiber still has a ways to go before disrupting the ISP market to the degree we hoped it would when it announced ""fiber is coming"" more than a decade ago."

The titles include: “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” “If I Ran the Zoo,” “McElligot’s Pool,” “On Beyond Zebra!,” “Scrambled Eggs Super!,” and “The Cat’s Quizzer.”  And a copy of “Mulberry Street” alone was being hawked on eBay on Thursday for $1,500. On Amazon, hardcover copies of “If I Ran the Zoo” start at $789 and climb to $5,000.Indeed, while an eBay spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that the company is “currently sweeping our marketplace to remove these items,”  hundreds of sellers could still be found selling editions of what they described as the “banned” or “canceled” Dr. Seuss books on eBay for hundreds of bucks on Thursday afternoon. One was offering  all six of the books books for $1,110, which had several bids. But saying the books have been “banned,” or that Dr. Seuss has been “canceled,” is a misnomer. First, Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the entertainment company that manages the estate of late children’s book author Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss, is the entity that decided to stop licensing and publishing those particular titles in the first place. “These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,” Dr. Seuss Enterprises explained in a statement released Monday, which coincided with Geisel’s birthday and Read Across America Day. What’s more, after a Virginia school district went viral for reportedly banning Dr. Seuss books, it clarified in a statement that Dr.Seuss books are still available in its libraries and classes. The school had simply decided to distance Read Across America Day from Dr. Seuss’s birthday due to the “strong racial undertones” in some of the books that he wrote and illustrated.Read more: Dr. Seuss is not canceled — but six of his books are being shelved over racist imagesPlus, the rhyming writer’s estate raked in $33 million in 2020 thanks to on-screen adaptations like “Green Eggs and Ham” for Netflix

66,Disinformation Is Among the Greatest Threats to Our Democracy. Here Are Three Key Ways to Fight It,Social Media,https://time.com/5944432/how-to-fight-disinformation-online/,"In October 2019, the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg was asked what she thought historians would see when they looked back on the Trump era in United States history. Justice Ginsberg, known for her colorful and often blistering legal opinions, replied tersely, “An aberration.”As President Biden’s administration settles in, many feel an enormous sense of relief, an awareness that the United States dodged a proverbial bullet. But how do we ensure that Justice Ginsberg’s prediction becomes reality? This is not an academic question; Trump’s recent speech at CPAC all but announced his desire to return in 2024. Only by recognizing the underlying reason he succeeded in the first place and by making the structural changes necessary to prevent someone like him from succeeding again can we head off this eventuality.First, to understand what we must do to prevent the return of someone like Trump or even Trump himself, we first need to define what Trumpism really is and how it came to be. The seeds of Trumpism in America have been analyzed to exhaustion, but something specific emerged in 2016 that holds the key to Trump’s rise to power: Online disinformation.Modern online disinformation exploits the attention-driven business model that powers most of the internet as we currently know it. Platforms like Google and Facebook make staggering amounts of money grabbing and capturing our attention so they can show us paid advertisements. That attention is gamed using algorithms that measure what content we engage with and automatically show us more content like it.The problem, of course, emerges when these algorithms automatically recommend and amplify our worst tendencies. As humans, we evolved to respond more strongly to negative stimuli than positive ones. These algorithms detect that and reinforce it, selecting content that sends us down increasingly negative rabbit holes. Resentful about losing your job? Here’s a video someone made about how immigrants stole that job from you! Hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine? Here’s a post from another user stoking a baseless anti-vaccine conspiracy theory. Notice, of course, that truth is nowhere in this calculus—the only metric the algorithm rewards is engagement, and it turns out that disinformation and conspiracy theory make the perfect fodder for this algorithmic amplification.This is also the perfect setup for someone like Trump to create further political turmoil in the future. People like him will say or do literally anything to grab attention as long as it benefits them. They lie outright solely to further their own immediate interests. Their disregard for truth is pathological. Their entire personas are fabrications designed to maximize ratings. Our modern information environment, which rewards engagement above all else, is perfect for someone like Trump to succeed unless we make fundamental changes to this system.Read Now: Shoshana Zuboff on Building an Internet That Lets Democracy FlourishNow is the time for strong tech reform. Disinformation is a product of a toxic internet business model, and Congress wields the power to change the conditions from which it emerged. This is not a “truth police.” I do not advocate regulating disinformation directly; so-called “anti fake news” laws passed in other countries are ripe for political exploitation to suppress free speech and antagonize dissidents, activists, and political rivals. Instead, by regulating the toxic business models underpinning our information environment, we will create a healthier ecosystem that stems the flow of disinformation, mitigates harm, and leads to a freer more productive conversation.We need strong legislation in three areas. The first is privacy. Personal data has become the most valuable resource in the world, with companies that collect it en masse replacing even oil companies as the most central businesses in the global economy. How does this relate to disinformation? For starters, personal data is the fuel that powers this algorithmic distortion engine. But the connection goes deeper. As Dr. Johnny Ryan, Senior Fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Open Markets Institute, argues, targeted advertising has robbed traditional media outlets of their primary asset: Their audience. This effect has devastated publisher revenues and destroyed the business models that previously supported quality journalism, leaving a news vacuum that is being filled by disinformation. Strong federal privacy laws that go beyond those already in place in Europe and California would help stem the damage to the media business model and re-establish an environment where quality journalism could thrive once again.The second area is antitrust. Right now, the digital ad tech market is dominated by two companies, Facebook and Google. Advertisers from around the world pay on average two thirds of their budget to just these two companies. This money is ultimately what pays for the internet we use so freely. This is also what disinformation peddlers seek to capture when they create salacious content to share on social media. By driving engagement and traffic to their sites, these malicious actors display ads and make money.All of this creates a risky situation for advertisers, who are loath to have their ads appear alongside disinformation, say, extolling the recent riots at the U.S. Capitol or dissuading people from getting the COVID-19 vaccine. And yet, the advertisers have little to no say over where their ads are appearing. They pay Google or Facebook, and those companies use algorithms to choose where to place the ads. And when the advertisers complain—as many did last summer as part of the #StopHateForProfit campaign—these companies simply defy them. They have no competition and thus little incentive to better serve their customers, the advertisers, by blocking ads—and funding—to sites peddling disinformation and hate.The final and most important area is content liability. Often referred to as “Section 230” reform, from Section 230 of the Telecommunications Decency Act of 1996, this is among the most difficult, but most critical areas of tech reform. Section 230 essentially makes internet platforms immune to legal liability for both the content that users post and the decisions they make to remove that content. Some call this law “the twenty six words that built the internet.”Under Section 230, Facebook, for example, assumes no liability when they suggest people join white supremacist groups, as their own internal data shows they do a whopping 64% of the time. They bear no responsibility when those people become radicalized and commit hate crimes or attack public buildings, even though it was Facebook that originally set them down the path.While there is widespread consensus that Section 230 needs to be reformed, it remains an open question how to do so in a way that adequately protects free speech. When the law was originally conceived, the popular analogy used at the time was that a platform was like a chalkboard in a town square—anyone could write anything on it, and the owner of the chalkboard was neither liable for what was written, nor what they chose to erase. It made sense in the early days of the internet when these platforms had far fewer users and weren’t dominated by algorithmically curated feeds.Today, the chalkboard analogy no longer applies. Billions of users are effectively feeding these algorithms an infinite supply of content from which to populate our feeds. A better analogy for today’s algorithmically driven platform would be one of those ransom notes from the movies, where the kidnapper cuts out magazine letters to spell words. We don’t accuse the magazines of the kidnapping even though they printed the letters, and just because the kidnapper used letters from magazines to spell the words doesn’t mean they didn’t “write” the note. In the same way, it’s not the content that’s the problem on the modern social media platform. It’s the algorithms that are weaving that content into personalized toxic narratives in order to drive engagement at the cost of everything else.This is what researchers mean when they compare freedom of speech to freedom of reach. We are all entitled to freedom of speech—though even that has limits in the face of imminent harm, and a clear link is emerging between online toxicity and offline harm—but algorithmic amplification, or “reach,” is the product of decisions made by private companies through the algorithms they program. Not only is there no intrinsic right to have those private companies show your posts to other users, but those companies should also be able to be held liable when they decide to do so via their algorithms if it ends up harming you or someone else. This is even truer when it comes to online advertising. Everyone has the right to say what they want on the web, but no one has a right to the money that advertisers pay into Google or Facebook to place ads next to that content. That should be entirely the choice of the advertisers footing the bill.Given this model, a solution becomes clearer. Any time a platform makes a decision—or programs an algorithm to make a decision—to show content to a user, the platform should assume liability for that decision. If Facebook recommends a white supremacist group to a user, and that user joins the group, becomes radicalized, plans violence there, and harms someone, the victim should be able to hold Facebook accountable for recommending the group and facilitating the planning. Sure, Facebook didn’t solely cause the harm, but they were involved and thus bear some responsibility. Right now, under the blanket immunity provided by Section 230, the victim can’t even take Facebook to court to hash it out, let alone hold them accountable. That’s what needs to change.Social media platforms have immensely affected the balance of power in media, giving space to voices that have historically been suppressed. But we need to update the rules that govern the manipulation of our information environment in order to prevent another nihilistic narcissist gaining power. The Global Disinformation Index, the nonprofit that I co-founded, has been working with the tech sector to stop the creation and spread of online disinformation. To date, we’ve partnered with tech companies, governments, and advocacy groups to disrupt these financial incentives to spread disinformation. Our industry-focused advocacy work is a start, but the world’s policymakers must now do their part. The EU is already leading the way with reforms through the Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts. These legislative initiatives, should they become law, seek to create platform liability and level the playing field in the ways that will make the web safer and more competitive. But since most of the companies affected are American, right now the most powerful levers to combat disinformation lay in the hands of Congress—it’s time to pull them and relegate Trumpism to the “aberration” Justice Ginsberg predicted it would be.Contact us at letters@time.com."
67,A Leading Critic of Big Tech Will Join the White House,Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html,"AdvertisementSupported byTim Wu’s appointment to the National Economic Council signals a confrontational approach by the Biden administration.By Cecilia KangWASHINGTON — President Biden on Friday named Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, to the National Economic Council as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy, putting one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech’s power into the administration.The appointment of Mr. Wu, 48, who is widely supported by progressive Democrats and antimonopoly groups, suggests that the administration plans to take on the size and influence of companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, including working with Congress on legislation to strengthen antitrust laws. During his campaign, Mr. Biden said he would be open to breaking up tech companies.That confrontational approach toward the tech industry would be a continuation of the one taken by the Trump administration. Late last year, federal and state regulators sued Facebook and Google, accusing them of antitrust violations. The regulators continue to investigate claims that Amazon and Apple unfairly squash competition.Mr. Biden has also expressed skepticism toward social media companies and the legal shield known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He told the New York Times editorial board in January 2020 that Section 230 “should be revoked, immediately.”The tech companies have fought vigorously against new antitrust laws and regulations, building out some of the most potent lobbying forces in Washington to push back.Mr. Wu has warned about the consequences of too much power in the hands of a few companies and said the nation’s economy resembled the Gilded Age of the late 1800s.“Extreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding the appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,” Mr. Wu wrote in his 2018 book, “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.”“Most visible in our daily lives is the great power of the tech platforms, especially Google, Facebook and Amazon,” he added.Mr. Wu was a contributing writer for The Times before dropping that position for his appointment to the White House.His role, with a focus on competition policy, will be a new one in the National Economic Council. Mr. Wu will also focus on competition in labor policy, such as noncompete clauses enforced by companies, and concentration in power in agriculture and the drug industry. The job does not require Senate approval.Mr. Biden has not yet named nominees to officially lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission — the main agencies overseeing competition in commerce. Progressives have vociferously fought for the appointments of left-leaning advocates like Mr. Wu over individuals with histories of working for tech companies and law firms that represent them.“Tim has been a longtime antitrust advocate, and he has pushed public officials to break up and rein in Big Tech,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement. “I’m glad to see him in this role.”Mr. Wu has left academia at various times to work in government. He was a special adviser to the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 and 2012 and then joined the National Economic Council to work on competition policy during the Obama administration, which was known for its kid-glove treatment of tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Mr. Wu has since expressed some regret.“I worked in the Obama administra­tion, and I worked in antitrust, so I will take some personal blame here, but we have not provided the merger oversight we should have,” Mr. Wu said in an interview at the Aspen Ideas festival in 2019. He added that “maybe sometimes we had an overly rosy view” of the tech sector.Relatively unbridled by regulations, those companies greatly expanded through mergers and acquisitions during President Barack Obama’s two terms. Mr. Wu has talked about the pivot of many Democrats since those days, with the realization that the tech giants have failed to live up to promises to protect user data, treat small competitors fairly and root out misinformation from their platforms.Mr. Wu is best known for advocacy against powerful telecom companies and for coining the term “net neutrality,” the regulatory philosophy that consumers should get equal access to all content on the internet. More recently, he has turned his attention to the gatekeepers — like Facebook, Google and Amazon — that dominate speech, search and retail online.During federal and state antitrust investigations of Facebook, he joined with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, to argue for the company’s breakup.The appointment sets the tone for a new era in antitrust enforcement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Ms. Klobuchar has introduced a broad bill to strengthen antitrust laws.“The laws haven’t changed, so enforcement and new ideas are key,” she said. “This is the shot in the arm that competition policy needs.”Advertisement"
68,Students Are Easily Cheating 'State-of-the-Art' Test Proctoring Tech,Software,https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an98j/students-are-easily-cheating-state-of-the-art-test-proctoring-tech,"“I’ve taken online exams cheating and not cheating and they are just about as stressful anyways so fuck it, am I right?” That’s what one French student who had cheated on multiple remote exams administered through the popular digital proctoring software Proctorio told Motherboard in a voice message. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to rage around the globe and no quick end to remote learning in sight, many students have found themselves taking exams under the watch of proctoring software like Proctorio, which surveils students through algorithmic systems that, among other things, detect eye movements, track keyboard strokes, and monitor audio inputs. Universities sometimes shell out thousands of dollars per exam for Proctorio, which helps at least give the impression that academic integrity is being maintained during remote learning. But for some students  using Proctorio and other online proctoring services is invasive and anxiety-inducing, subjecting them and their surroundings to unwarranted surveillance that is difficult to refuse without their studies being negatively affected. Yet, despite the fact that popular online proctoring platforms like Proctorio claim that they use “state-of-the-art technology” and “ensure the total learning integrity of every assessment, every time,” students are cheating on their exams anyways. Motherboard spoke to 10 university students from various countries who claimed to have cheated on exams where Proctorio was in place. While their motivations and techniques varied, there was one common denominator: none of them got caught. The relative ease with which the students cheated, and the fact that each student could point to multiple peers who had done the same (one American student estimated that 90 percent of her class had cheated), raises the question of how effective online proctoring software like Proctorio actually is—and whether it is worth the hefty price tag or the invasion of privacy. “With Proctorio obviously you need to show yourself and your room with the computer’s webcam,” one Dutch student who had helped a friend cheat on a multiple choice exam told Motherboard. “My friend put a phone on a stand on his keyboard so it couldn’t be seen during the room and desk sweep.” “Then we FaceTimed with me at the other end,” she continued. “The phone was at a slant so he could see me and I could see the exam. Then I would just hold up a flashcard with a, b, c, or d.” Another French student used a 10-meter HDMI cable that ran from his laptop to a TV screen in another room that mirrored his screen. His friend would then look up the exam answers and send it via WhatsApp to his phone, which was also on the keyboard and out of sight of the webcam. “Worked perfectly and got a good grade,” he said. Other students used less elaborate techniques, such as one Italian student who wrote notes in pencil on her laptop and a Brazilian student who simply spread sheets of notes on the floor. “For one exam I just printed out my notes using a large font and stuck them to the wall in front of me out of view,” one German student who had successfully cheated on multiple exams said, laughing. “I would just look around the room as if I was thinking about an answer and then glance at it.” In a statistics exam that allowed calculators, that same student stuck a small piece of paper behind the calculator so it would be hidden from view during the desk sweep. There are other more technical cheating options as well. A test taker could feed faked audio or video through a virtual device, which can simply be renamed to avoid Proctorio’s blacklist. This same renaming trick can also be used to run Proctorio within a virtual machine. While Proctorio claimed in an email to Motherboard that it offers a native application offering more sophisticated techniques for detecting these types of tricks, it also said that its native application is usually not an option for universities because of privacy regulations. It’s important to note that in the case of Proctorio, there are a number of settings that instructors can turn on or off for exams, including whether the software will check for extended screens and whether a desk sweep is required. Furthermore, instructors can also set ‘sensitivity values’ for a range of activities when reviewing an exam, including audio levels, video manipulation, and eye movement. But whether higher sensitivity values actually catch more cheating or just create a flood of false positives remains an open question. Maximilian Seiderer is a Master’s student studying computer science at the Technical University of Munich in Southern Germany. Skeptical of the effectiveness of Proctorio and finding the software “creepy,” he decided to file a subject access request under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to see the recording of his exam—something easy to do for any student residing in the European Union. A university staff member later walked Seiderer through the Proctorio interface and his exam recording. He also received a PDF report containing frames and timestamps where Proctorio had flagged ‘abnormal’ behavior. Flagged timestamp and frame from a post-exam report generated by Proctorio. This moment was apparently flagged because the “audio level in the room was above threshold” and “the test taker looked away from the exam page.” “I wanted to see how Proctorio functioned from the instructor’s perspective and I was also curious to see if it had captured the moment I had put in a snus [tobacco pouch],” Seiderer told Motherboard. “I got to see what was flagged, which was mostly audio level violations. When the staff member turned up the sensitivity settings it was a literal sea of red flags, which were of course false positives. I can’t imagine anyone seriously using that interface.”“Throughout the process, I kind of got the impression that everybody feels like they have to do something to ensure the integrity of the exams but they don’t really believe in it,” he continued. “I’m disappointed that my university pays for that type of snake oil.” In an email and later a phone call in response to a set of questions sent by Motherboard, a Proctorio spokesperson emphasized that their software is an integral means to maintaining academic integrity and that they welcome a robust conversation regarding privacy. “Proctorio is designed to prevent fraud through a variety of different proctoring options,” a spokesperson wrote. “The combination of available proctoring methods (e.g. video, audio, device lock-down options) are currently the best possible protection. In the area of exam proctoring, there is competition from professional ‘cheating service’ providers (e.g., payforexams.com, chegg.com).” “Currently, online exams are the only option when it comes to giving students access to testing, which ultimately prevent negative career effects due to missed deadlines,” the spokesperson continued. “Exam results demonstrate the competencies and achievements required for academic advancement and further employment. An exam process that is aligned with the requirements of the pandemic is a basic requirement for degree programs.” Some students who spoke to Motherboard said that the fact that they were forced to use this software actually made them more likely to cheat as an act of rebellion. Others said that the COVID-19 pandemic had left them feeling isolated and unmotivated when it came to their studies, but still felt the pressure to pass courses to avoid delays. “Corona wasn't hitting me very well and I lost track,” the same student who had used the HDMI cable trick said. “I had zero motivation to actually work and life was so fucked up and weird. And then of course there was the fact that it was sort of a ‘fuck you’ to Proctorio. I’m not going to say that was the main reason, but it certainly was part of it.” While Proctorio and other proctoring companies often present their software as a necessary evil in the context of a pandemic, instructors have argued there are other, (more effective ways of preventing academic fraud. This can be through designing test environments which prevent cheating without using surveillance, or through adjusting course structures to base final grades on other forms of assessment, such as an average of a few interim assignments or an open-book exam. Online proctoring software is certainly the easy way, but that doesn’t mean it is always the right way. As for students who have seen how easy it is to actually cheat on exams with online proctoring software, the ones that Motherboard spoke to didn’t think too highly of the universities that are using them. “They can’t admit to having bought a useless piece of crap,” Seiderer said."

It's time for a change.  Also: What about Firefox? I don't say this lightly.  Over the past few months, I've been testing browsers, examining things like performance, memory usage, battery usage, and overall feel of using the browser.   I know that picking the ""best"" browser is a personal and potentially controversial thing. It's a bit like asking whose Mom makes the best apple pie (mine, of course), or whether it's cats or dogs that rule (cats, because dogs are just a rubbish, attention-seeking kind of cat).  The answers are personal. Specific to the individual use case.  But, with that said, I can still come up with a number of good reasons to dump Chrome.  If your device is powered by a battery, then you're best using the stock browser.   On Windows, that is Edge, and on Mac and iOS that's Safari. Both have been highly tuned to the platform they are running on and offer the best battery life and thermal performance possible.   Yes, you can tweak and fiddle with Chrome to make things better, but better is still far from best.   Also: Google is really annoyed you're using Microsoft Edge When I switched from Chrome to Safari on my daily driver MacBook Pro, I was getting over an hour of extra battery life, which is a very significant gain.   Switching to Safari on the iPhone also got me significantly better battery life, but it's harder to measure since the browser isn't the main focus of my day on that platform.  For the best possible battery and power performance, use the stock browser.   Period.  One of the great ""selling"" points of Google Chrome is that you get a streamlined, consistent experience across all the platforms you are using.   That's nice for sure, but after using Edge and Safari on their respective platforms for a few weeks, I was surprised to find how clunky that experience actually is, compared to the stock browser.

It's hard to put it into words, but Safari on Mac or Edge on Windows feel like an extension of the operating system. It's a smoother transition between the OS and the browser. Coming back to Chrome suddenly felt clumsy (and this is when I also noticed the sluggish performance the most).  Google Chrome is a great tool for Google to slurp up a lot of data, both to find out how people use the internet and also things like passwords and payment details to keep us locked into the ecosystem.  While I'm not paranoid about my data, I'm a fan of having a choice over where my data is stored and how it's used, and what companies I choose to work with, and being able to pick and choose what works best for me, not what is convenient.  And that is Android. Here Google Chrome is the winner. I've played with other browsers on this platform, but Chrome is the one that works best. It is, after all, the stock browser, and has such as been tweaked to give the best performance.  Also: Best Google Chrome extensions in 2021What browser do you use? Why do you use it?

When she flew to San Diego in October 2013 with her friend who found a modeling ad on Craigslist, Jane Doe 7 believed she’d be paid $2,000 to do a nude photo shoot. And that photo shoot would only be released in Australia.Instead, she found a much different reality. Jane Doe 7 ended up filming a porn video under duress in a hotel room where furniture blocked the door, preventing her from leaving.First, Jane Doe 7 found out the photo shoot was actually a video shoot only when she was picked up at the airport by Matthew Wolfe, a videographer working for the porn website GirlsDoPorn. Doe didn’t know that last fact, either.She asked at least 20 times where the video would air before agreeing to do it. Both Wolfe and porn actor Andre Garcia assured her the video would not go online, but it would instead be released on DVD in Australia. It was a believable lie given Wolfe’s New Zealand accent and the duo’s consistency in telling the same story.Once Doe agreed to film the video, she was rushed through signing a contract and told “we needed to get this done.” Wolfe and Garcia soon put furniture in front of the hotel room door during filming; Jane Doe 7 said she couldn’t leave and was scared.“I was being coached and I felt like I had to do it,” Doe said later during trial.The sex was so hard Doe bled. She locked herself in the bathroom while Wolfe and Garcia tried to coax her out. Eventually, she finished the shoot and took a shower. But soon after the incident, she was harassed at work—Jane Doe 7’s video had been posted online. While she only looked at it on one website, others told Doe the video was now all over the Internet.“I’m too afraid to Google it,” Doe said.Jane Doe 7 was far from the only woman duped into filming pornography for the subscription website GirlsDoPorn. Her experience ultimately led to a San Diego Superior Court room where—one by one over the course of several months—22 millennial women answered affirmatively when attorneys for GirlsDoPorn asked them if they had ever viewed porn online. Yet in this fraud trial, these women all claimed they believed the porn videos they shot, which were published among GirlsDoPorn’s library of hundreds of porn flicks viewed collectively over one billion times, would never get posted online.How could millennial women, living in an age where porn is almost exclusively viewed online, ever believe their own videos would never be posted on the Internet? To start, it takes a thought-out criminal scheme where the perpetrators were dedicated to leaving no paper trail. But GirlsDoPorn's successful manipulation was possible because large swaths of society still label women who participate in sex work as cultural pariahs. The GirlsDoPorn operators knew this, and they wagered the Does' shame over appearing in porn would likely ensure these victims would not take the site's management to task for this fraud.Ultimately, though, the wild success of those viral GirlsDoPorn Internet videos is what led to the site team's downfall. The Does were eventually able to find one another—and by doing so, they collectively found the strength to come forth and build a successful legal case against GirlsDoPorn.The owners and operators of GirlsDoPorn knew the type of women they wanted to appear in their amateur porn videos—college-age millennials—would not agree to casually participate in the porn industry. After all, these women grew up in the Internet age, where amateur porn has been rampantly available for years. On top of that, many instances of their peers’ sexual exploration through sexting had traveled down several slippery slopes, including cases where teens had been criminally charged for sharing x-rated media they took of themselves.In 2019, a Maryland appellate court found 6-1 that child pornography laws apply when a teen is both the subject and sender of sexually explicit media. Under the ruling, where the judicial panel encouraged lawmakers to change the law, the appellate court upheld a lower court’s decision where a 16-year-old girl was convicted as her own pornographer. Prosecution of minors under child pornography laws, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned in 2019, “has the potential to have dire legal ramifications for teens,” as sexting among young people—and prosecution of them under child pornography laws—continues to rise.That’s precisely why GirlsDoPorn owner Michael Pratt, videographer Matthew Wolfe, and actor Andre Garcia created a bait-and-switch scheme to get the women to appear in their videos.That scheme, revealed during the months-long trial in San Diego Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright’s courtroom, led to criminal human trafficking charges being filed by the US Attorneys Office in the Southern District of California.Garcia pleaded guilty (PDF) last year to conspiracy and sex-trafficking charges related to five Doe victims. He faces 15 years to life in prison. Wolfe is in federal custody awaiting trial. Pratt is a fugitive on the FBI’s Most Wanted list, and there is a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. He may have fled to his native New Zealand, where authorities there are looking for him and have agreed to extradite him to the United States if he’s caught.GirlsDoPorn’s racket started with strategic targeting. All three men were involved in recruiting college students to shoot their first porn videos, and by and large they sought out women who were low-income and may have needed money for things like rent, books, and tuition.From there, the scheme grew digitally. These women were recruited via Craigslist modeling ads and then directed to fill out contact forms on benign-sounding websites like BeginModeling.com and CaliforniaModeling.com. They were then contacted by Garcia, who revealed applicants were actually being recruited to film a 30-minute porn video that they would be paid several thousand dollars to film.In general, at this point, the GirlsDoPorn trio had to quell the natural skepticism while also avoiding much of a paper trail. Garcia would proactively tell the women the videos were either for a private collector or to be sold on DVDs in adult stores overseas in places like New Zealand and Australia. The videos would never get posted online, and their names would never be associated with the videos, Garcia claimed.As soon as women had particular questions about where the porn videos were distributed, Garcia would take the conversations offline. He called and FaceTimed the women, dodging answering any specific questions by instead offering to immediately book plane tickets—even before any women had agreed to participate in the filming.During the trial, Garcia pleaded the fifth and did not testify.Wolfe was the only one of the three to testify in person. He said during the trial that he filmed around 100 videos for GirlsDoPorn and moved to the US in 2011 to help Pratt, his childhood friend from New Zealand. Wolfe, who was identified as the “person most qualified” to testify on behalf of the company, is also an owner of GirlsDoPorn’s affiliate website, GirlsDoToys.According to Wolfe, Garcia was still recruiting women to film videos for GirlsDoPorn during the trial. But Wolfe said he did not know about any policies in place during the trial to tell the women their videos could end up on GirlsDoPorn’s website.“Do any contracts presented to models since the lawsuit was filed in June 2016 reference websites?” attorney Brian Holm asked Wolfe.“No, I don’t believe so,” Wolfe said.“Is it fair to say the contracts being used in recruiting today are the same as the contracts prior to the lawsuit?” Holm asked.“I think so,” Wolfe confirmed.“Were the contracts changed in any way to reference GirlsDoPorn.com?” Holm pressed.“No,” Wolfe responded.When Wolfe was asked about the use of the word “website” on a version of the model talent release form GirlsDoPorn had some of the models sign, Wolfe said he wasn’t aware of any questions or concerns raised by the women who were recruited to film videos for DVDs sold overseas. But he made an aside:“That’s where almost all of pornography that’s produced goes,” Wolfe said.“It only went on the Internet? It only went on websites?” Holm asked.“Yes,” Wolfe confirmed.When asked if women had insisted on knowing where the videos were published, Wolfe said he would have told them it was posted online but would not have disclosed GirlsDoPorn’s name “because of online trolls harassing GirlsDoPorn’s employees.”“Most people know porn goes online,” he said.Just as attorneys for GirlsDoPorn asked the women one by one during their testimony in the months-long trial if they had ever viewed porn online, the Does’ own attorneys asked all of them a different question: would they have agreed to appear in GirlsDoPorn’s videos had they known the truth—that the videos were posted online?One by one, the women each had the same response: they would not have appeared in the videos.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

73,YouTube removes five Myanmar TV channels from platform,Politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AX0BQ?il=0,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Reuters Staff3 Min ReadSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s YouTube has removed five channels of Myanmar’s military-run television networks hosted on its platform in the wake of the coup in the Southeast Asian country.“We have terminated a number of channels and removed several videos from YouTube in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws,” a YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement in response to a Reuters question.The channels taken down include the state network, MRTV, (Myanma Radio and Television) as well as the military-owned Myawaddy Media, MWD Variety and MWD Myanmar, YouTube said.Their removal comes during the bloodiest week so far of anti-coup protests, with 38 people killed on Wednesday, according to the United Nations, as security forces tried to crush rallies and used live rounds in some areas.The army seized power on Feb. 1, alleging mass fraud in the November election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government. The election commission said the vote was fair, but the military has used media to make its case and justify the takeover.MRTV pages were banned by Facebook in February, while it had previously barred Myawaddy in 2018 when it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and more than a dozen other senior officers and organisations on the platform.Facebook has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar’s army - and was itself banned by the junta in February.Other social media platforms are also grappling with how to moderate military content and a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation in Myanmar.Reuters reported on Thursday that Myanmar soldiers and police were using TikTok to deliver death threats to protesters. [L2N2L21Q5]Researchers have said that after the Facebook ban the military was trying to build its presence on other platforms.YouTube had faced criticism from researchers and civil society groups for a comparatively hands-off approach during Myanmar’s Nov. 8 vote.A Reuters review found dozens of channels hosted on YouTube that had promoted election misinformation while posing either as news outlets or political programmes.Google said in December it had terminated 34 YouTube channels following investigation into coordinated influence operations linked to Myanmar.Reporting by Fanny Potkin; Editing by Ed DaviesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

78,Study Reveals Extent of Privacy Vulnerabilities with Amazon’s Alexa,Security,http://csc.ncsu.edu/news/2390,"
For Immediate Release Matt Shipman | News Services | 919.515.6386 Dr. Anupam Das | 919.515.8650 News Releases A recent
study outlines a range of privacy concerns related to the programs that users
interact with when using Amazon’s voice-activated assistant, Alexa. Issues
range from misleading privacy policies to the ability of third-parties to
change the code of their programs after receiving Amazon approval. “When people
use Alexa to play games or seek information, they often think they’re
interacting only with Amazon,” says Anupam Das, co-author of the paper and an
assistant professor of computer science at North Carolina State University.
“But a lot of the applications they are interacting with were created by third
parties, and we’ve identified several flaws in the current vetting process that
could allow those third parties to gain access to users’ personal or private
information.” At issue are
the programs that run on Alexa, allowing users to do everything from listen to
music to order groceries. These programs, which are roughly equivalent to the
apps on a smartphone, are called skills. Amazon has sold at least 100 million Alexa devices (and possibly twice that many), and there are more
than 100,000 skills for users to choose from. Because the majority of
these skills are created by third-party developers, and Alexa is used in homes,
researchers wanted to learn more about potential security and privacy concerns. With that
goal in mind, the researchers used an automated program to collect 90,194
unique skills found in seven different skill stores. The research team also
developed an automated review process that provided a detailed analysis of each
skill. One problem
the researchers noted was that the skill stores display the developer
responsible for publishing the skill. This is a problem because Amazon does not
verify that the name is correct. In other words, a developer can claim to be
anyone. This would make it easy for an attacker to register under the name of a
more trustworthy organization. That, in turn, could fool users into thinking
the skill was published by the trustworthy organization, facilitating phishing
attacks. The
researchers also found that Amazon allows multiple skills to use the same
invocation phrase. “This is
problematic because, if you think you are activating one skill, but are
actually activating another, this creates the risk that you will share
information with a developer that you did not intend to share information
with,” Das says. “For example, some skills require linking to a third-party
account, such as an email, banking, or social media account. This could pose a
significant privacy or security risk to users.” In addition,
the researchers demonstrated that developers can change the code on the back
end of skills after the skill has been placed in stores. Specifically, the
researchers published a skill and then modified the code to request additional
information from users after the skill was approved by Amazon. “We were not
engaged in malicious behavior, but our demonstration shows that there aren’t
enough controls in place to prevent this vulnerability from being abused,” Das
says. Amazon does
have some privacy protections in place, including explicit requirements related
to eight types of personal data – including location data, full names and phone
numbers. One of those requirements is that any skills requesting this data must
have a publicly available privacy policy in place explaining why the skill
wants that data and how the skill will use the data. But the
researchers found that 23.3% of 1,146 skills that requested access to privacy-sensitive
data either didn’t have privacy policies or their privacy policies were
misleading or incomplete. For example, some requested private information even
thought their privacy policies stated they were not requesting private
information. The researchers
also outline a host of recommendations for how to make Alexa more secure and
empower users to make more informed decisions about their privacy. For example,
the researchers encourage Amazon to validate the identity of skill developers
and to use visual or audio cues to let users know when they are using skills
that were not developed by Amazon itself. “This
release isn’t long enough to talk about all of the problems or all of the
recommendations we outline in the paper,” Das says. “There is a lot of room for
future work in this field. For example, we’re interested in what users’
expectations are in terms of system security and privacy when they interact
with Alexa.” The paper, “Hey Alexa, is
this Skill Safe?: Taking a Closer Look at the Alexa Skill Ecosystem,” was
presented at the Network and Distributed Systems Security Symposium 2021, which
was held Feb. 21-24. First author of the paper is Christopher Lentzsch of
Ruhr-Universität Bochum. The paper was co-authored by Sheel Jayesh Shah, a
graduate student at NC State; William Enck, an associate professor at
NC State; Martin Degeling at Ruhr-Universität Bochum; and Benjamin Andow
of Google Inc. The work was
done with support from the National Science Foundation under grant 1849997, and
from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. -shipman- Note to

is this Skill Safe?: Taking a Closer Look at the Alexa Skill Ecosystem” Authors: Christopher Lentzsch and Martin
Degeling, Ruhr-Universität Bochum; Sheel Jayesh Shah, Anupam Das and William
Enck, North Carolina State University; and Benjamin Andow, Google Inc. Presented: Feb. 21-24, Network and
Distributed Systems Security Symposium 2021 DOI: 10.14722/ndss.2021.23111 Abstract: Amazon’s voice-based assistant, Alexa, enables users to directly
interact with various web services through natural language dialogues. It
provides developers with the option to create third-party applications (known
as Skills) to run on top of Alexa. While such applications ease users’
interaction with smart devices and bolster a number of additional services,
they also raise security and privacy concerns due to the personal setting they
operate in. This paper aims to perform a systematic analysis of the Alexa skill
ecosystem. We perform the first large-scale analysis of Alexa skills, obtained
from seven different skill stores totaling to 90,194 unique skills. Our
analysis reveals several limitations that exist in the current skill vetting
process. We show that not only can a malicious user publish a skill under any
arbitrary developer/company name, but she can also make backend code changes
after approval to coax users into revealing unwanted information. We, next,
formalize the different skill-squatting techniques and evaluate the efficacy of
such techniques. We find that while certain approaches are more favorable than
others, there is no substantial abuse of skill squatting in the real world.
Lastly, we study the prevalence of privacy policies across different categories
of skill, and more importantly the policy content of skills that use the Alexa
permission model to access sensitive user data. We find that around 23.3% of
such skills do not fully disclose the data types associated with the
permissions requested. We conclude by providing some suggestions for
strengthening the overall ecosystem, and thereby enhance transparency for
end-users.Return To News Homepage

But while sources of information elsewhere on the political spectrum frequently suffer a “misinformation penalty” – a measurable decline in engagement for being unreliable – “being a consistent spreader of far-right misinformation appears to confer a significant advantage,” the report found.Facebook says the NYU study mostly examines how people engage with certain types of content, not how many people actually see it on the platform.""When you look at the content that gets the most reach across Facebook, it's not at all as partisan as this study suggests,"" the company said in a statement.But the report echoes findings from other researchers that far-right content resonates with Facebook users, in large part because it elicits strong reactions.An analysis of millions of social media posts by Politico and the nonpartisan think tank Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that right-wing social media influencers, media outlets and some GOP supporters drove the online conversation about the Black Lives Matter movement and voter fraud, two of the most heated election issues.“There is evidence that content from highly conservative news sites is favored by Facebook algorithms,” Steven Johnson, an information technology professor at the University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce told USA TODAY in November. Right-wing personalities have a distinct advantage on the platform, not because the algorithms favor conservatives but because they connect with people on a visceral level, Facebook said in September.“Right-wing populism is always more engaging,"" a Facebook executive told Politico when asked why conservative commentators Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro drive such high engagement.Does Facebook censor conservatives?:Claims 'not supported by the facts,' new research saysTrump and Biden vs. Facebook and Twitter:Why Section 230 could get repealed in 2021The executive said the content speaks to ""an incredibly strong, primitive emotion"" by touching on such topics as ""nation, protection, the other, anger, fear.""The top five news and information sources included in the NYU study were Dan Bongino, Newsmax, Breitbart, TruthFeed and Trending Politics. NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check determined the partisan nature of the sources.Engagement with posts from far-right and far-left news sources peaked around Election Day and again on Jan. 6 when a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, the report found."
80,Razer's smart glasses are like Echo Frames with blue light filtering,Hardware,https://www.engadget.com/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-audio-blue-light-030038052.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618,"Glasses that can double as headphones are an increasingly popular category. After Bose unveiled its version in 2019 and Amazon launched the Echo Frames in 2020, the next big company to jump on this trend is Razer. It's officially announcing the Anzu smart glasses today that will filter out blue light and also project audio into your ears without drowning out environmental sound completely. These are available now starting at $200 — $50 less than Amazon's device.The key differences between the Anzu and the Echo Frames are the fact that blue-light filtering appears to be a default feature on Razer's version. While you can get prescription lenses fitted on the Echo Frames, the standard option is clear with no sun or blue light protection.Based on the renders, the Anzu look incredibly similar to the Echo Frames in terms of general bulkiness. That is to say, they appear to be just as compact. According to specs sheets though, the Anzu is about 10 grams heavier than the Echo Frames. While Amazon only offered one lens shape, Razer will have round or rectangular options, and you can fit the Anzu with lenses that turn them into sunglasses. It's not yet clear whether the Anzu will be available in multiple colors, including the company's signature green, but Amazon's product comes in three hues.Like the Echo Frames, the Anzu offers touch controls via a panel on the side, and you can use this to manage music playback, accept or reject calls, activate your phone's assistant or turn on ""gaming mode."" They use a customized Bluetooth 5.1 connection that brings 60ms latency that should prevent your audio from stuttering. Also, Razer promises ""more than 5 hours of battery life"" and up to two weeks of stand-by power when you're not actively using the device. There's also an omnidirectional mic onboard so your callers can hear you.If you need prescription lenses to go with the Anzu, you can get a 15 percent discount if you buy them via Razer's partner Lensabl. The standard option comes with 35 percent blue-light filtering lenses, which is a feature I felt the Echo Frames could have benefitted from having.Finally, the Anzu is rated IPX4 so it's splashproof. This means that while you shouldn't take it for a swim, it'll survive being caught in the rain for a short time. For $200, the Anzu comes with a carrying case, a USB-A charging cable and polarized UVA/UVB sunglass replacement lenses. It's available via Razer's website and Best Buy already if you're itching to buy one, but I'd recommend waiting till we can test it out before you spend your hard-earned money.Please enter a valid email address"

A new anti-drone kit billed as the Swiss Army Knife of drone defenses just debuted from French company CERBAIR. The drone detection and mitigation tool -- the business end of which is a hip-fired electromagnetic rifle -- is emblematic of a growing urgency to develop security tools for guarding against rogue drone attacks.The prevalence and growing sophistication of drones has created a serious obstacle for law enforcement. Commercially available drones can be used to threaten government officials and carry out attacks during public gatherings and events. A joint multi-agency threat assessment issued prior to then-incoming President Biden's inauguration listed drones as a potential threat. Violent non-state actors have already been known to use drones in combat. ""Although these drones are about the size of a watermelon and may have a range of only a few miles, they still pose a risk,"" writes Thomas Braun in his paper Miniature Menace in the journal Wild Blue Yonder. ""In the hands of a [violent non-state actor], these small, inexpensive consumer drones are modified into ""killer bees"" capable of creating significant damage and terrorizing civilian and military populations.""The terrorist organization ISIL established a drone division, says Braun, citing one example, and cartel groups in Central and South America have deployed drone technology for various purposes. With a growing recognition of the threat of white supremacy and right wing militias around the world, security forces are on guard against drone attacks--a militarized right wing group in the Ukraine has stockpiled drones and other weapons, for example.Also: Best surveillance drone for security and business in 2021All of which points to the need for effective drone countermeasures. Not surprisingly, a number of technologies for detecting, identifying, tracking, and disabling drones have come to market in the past few years. Radio frequency analyzers effectively detect radio waves sent between drones and their controllers and some units with multiple dispersed antennas can triangulate signal origin location. Acoustic sensors, such as those from Squarehead Technologies, work well in short-range scenarios where there isn't a lot of background noise, and optical sensors, including infrared and thermal sensors, as well as visual spectrum cameras, are commonly deployed to track drones. In line with other aircraft detection, radar is also frequently used to track drones.Things start to get exotic when it comes to disabling drones. Devices include RF jammers to disrupt the signal between the drone and the controller, GPS spoofers to confuse a drone about its location, net guns, lasers, and even birds trained to disable drones in flight.The CERBAIR kit includes a backpack and vest with a detection module, a command and control tablet and an electromagnetic effector. According to the company, drone detection is processed by omnidirectional analysis of radio frequency spectrum. Once the alert has been given (both visual and audio), the azimuthal location of the rogue drone and its pilot are tracked using a directional antenna.Because the kit tracks a rogue drone's location, the electromagnetic gun can be used beyond line of sight.Of course, the arms race is bound to work both ways. As more police and security forces utilize drones for surveillance, the prevalence of anti-drone technology may become an increasing liability. For the time being, CERBAIR's kit is being used, among others, by special forces that protect heads of state.

82,"In battle with U.S., China to focus on 7 ‘frontier’ technologies from chips to brain-computer fusion",Business,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/china-to-focus-on-frontier-tech-from-chips-to-quantum-computing.html,"GUANGZHOU, China — China is looking to boost research into what it calls ""frontier technology"" including quantum computing and semiconductors, as it competes with the U.S. for supremacy in the latest innovations.In its five-year development plan, the 14th of its kind, Beijing said it would make ""science and technology self-reliance and self-improvement a strategic pillar for national development,"" according to a CNBC translation.Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday that China would increase research and development spending by more than 7% per year between 2021 and 2025, in pursuit of ""major breakthroughs"" in technology.China's technology champions such as Huawei and SMIC have been targeted by U.S. sanctions as tensions between Beijing and Washington have ramped up in the past few years.As such, China has concentrated on boosting its domestic expertise in areas it sees as strategically important, such as semiconductors. And now it has laid out seven ""frontier technologies"" that it will prioritize not just for the next five years, but beyond too.China plans to focus on specialized chip development for AI applications and developing so-called open source algorithms. Open source technology is usually developed by one entity and licensed by other companies.There will also be an emphasis on machine learning in areas such as decision making. Machine learning is the development of AI programs trained on vast amounts of data. The program ""learns"" as it is fed more data.AI has been a key field for Chinese companies and the central government over the last few years. Major companies such as Alibaba and Baidu have been investing in the technology.China and the U.S. are competing for AI dominance. A group of experts chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said China could soon replace the U.S. as the world's ""AI superpower.""This is category of technology involves quantum computing. This is a totally different concept from the computers we use today and holds the promise of being able to aid in ambitious feats such as the creation of new medicine.Quantum computing is seen as another area of competition between the U.S. and China.Semiconductors are a critical area for China and one it has invested a lot in over the past few years but the country has struggled to catch up to the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea.The problem is the complexity of the semiconductor supply chain. Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are the two most advanced chip manufacturers but they rely on tools from the U.S. and Europe.Washington has put SMIC, China's biggest chip manufacturer, on an export blacklist called the Entity List. SMIC cannot get its hands on American technology. And the U.S. has reportedly pushed to stop Dutch company ASML from shipping a key tool that could help SMIC catch up to rivals.Since China doesn't have the companies that can design and make the tools that its chip manufacturers require, it relies on companies from other countries. This is something China wants to change.In its five-year plan, China says it will focus on research and development in integrated circuit design tools, key equipment and key materials.Chips are incredibly important because they go into many of the devices we use such as smartphones but are also important for other industries.China plans to research areas such as how to stop diseases of the brain.But it also says that it plans to look into ""brain-inspired computing"" as well as ""brain-computer fusion technology,"" according to a CNBC translation. The five-year plan did not elaborate on what that could look like.However, such work is already underway in the U.S. at Elon Musk's company Neuralink. Musk is working on implantable brain-chip interfaces to connect humans and computers.With the outbreak of the coronavirus last year, biotechnology has grown in importance.China says it will focus on ""innovative vaccines"" and ""research on biological security.""China's research will concentrate on understanding the progression of cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic diseases.The government also says that it will research some ""cutting-edge"" treatment technologies such as regenerative medicine. This involves medicine that can regrow or repair damaged cells, tissues and organs.China says it will also be looking at key technologies in the prevention and treatment of major transmissible diseases.Space exploration has been a top priority for China recently. Beijing said it will focus on research into the ""origin and evolution of the universe,"" exploration of Mars as well as deep sea and polar research.In December, a Chinese spacecraft returned to Earth carrying rocks from the moon. It was the first time China has launched a spacecraft from an extraterrestrial body and the first time it has collected moon samples. And in July, China launched a mission to Mars called Tianwen -1.— CNBC's Iris Wang contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

83,Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service,Software,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313831/ios-14-5-default-music-service-siri-requests-apple-update,"Filed under:Instead, Siri wants to better understand your music-listening preferencesiOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified with TechCrunch that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. In our testing of the first iOS 14.5 beta, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, TechCrunch reports.“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to TechCrunch. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.Apple also noted to TechCrunch that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was dropped from the second beta before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release. Apple declined to comment if it would appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.Update March 4th, 7:45PM ET: Apple declined to comment on if the feature would appear in the final version of iOS 14.5.A newsletter about computers"
84,Spotting UFOs: Do-it-yourself sky surveillance comes online,Machine Learning,https://www.space.com/spotting-ufos-sky-hub-surveillance,"
By
Leonard David
03 March 2021
If you are perplexed, befuddled and bewildered about reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and possible visitations of alien spacecraft, you can take action with do-it-yourself sky-monitoring gear.Given the low cost and high capability of today's consumer-grade technology, you too can be at the ready to document out-of-the-ordinary events.Enter the world of Sky Hub, a global network of smart sensors designed to snag digital signatures of anomalous events. This crowd-sourced network of smart trackers with ""edge processing"" uploads data of unusual phenomena to a Sky Hub Cloud.The driving forces empowering the Sky Hub initiative center on the rapid growth and evolution of machine learning for streamlining the analysis of large datasets and the increasing affordability of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready hardware. These advancements can be harnessed to probe the ongoing, baffling behavior of UAP and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) reportedly crisscrossing the skies. Related: 7 things most often mistaken for UFOsThe mission of Sky Hub is clearcut: Connect a network of civilian-owned sensor arrays, use machine learning to catalogue anomalous events, and share this data with researchers. The group itself consists of dedicated volunteers.The Sky Hub system is a work in progress, said Christopher Cogswell, chair of Sky Hub's science advisory board. The group encourages individuals to join, but early adopters should be aware that the system software is currently in alpha, and hardware changes are still possible. The ultimate goal is building and hosting a worldwide, digital UFO database that anyone can access under a Creative Commons License using Sky Hub's open-source software.""I have long been interested in why certain technologies or scientific concepts were readily accepted by society … while others become flashpoints,"" Cogswell told Space.com. Looking for UAP/UFOs ""is not only an opportunity to make this something interesting, but also useful,"" he added. ""There are lots of reports of objects in the sky that we don't know how to categorize that I think are interesting and worthy of study.""Cogswell said that Sky Hub currently has 12 operational units. Most are in the United States, but there are some in the United Kingdom and one in Brazil. For the most part, the units are standard, using a fisheye lens camera and other hardware. Suggested specifications, such as a microcomputer built for machine learning and AI, are posted on the Sky Hub website.""We don't want to run before we can walk,"" Cogswell said, but new ideas are always welcomed. The cost to assemble a Sky Hub unit for deployment can range from $600 to $1,000. ""We're constantly trying to find cheaper alternatives. We want Sky Hub to be accessible to people,"" he said, ""and having the public be part of this project with us is a worthy goal."" So far, Sky Hub equipment has captured meteors, imaged the International Space Station and even spotted flocks of birds, what appears to be a drone, and a paraglider. ""We're open to those in other fields that can use Sky Hub where optical measurements and characterization can be useful,"" Cogswell said.In diving into the UFO/UAP situation, ""we are looking at this from a serious but skeptical perspective,"" Cogswell said. ""In my opinion, there is something interesting happening here that's worth investigating. You can't deny that there are people who still make reports of UFOs every year. If it's all fake, in my mind, that's almost more interesting. How did something untrue become such a social phenomenon like this?""Related: UFO watch: 8 times the government looked for flying saucers""There have been several such projects over the years to attempt to record UFOs,"" said Robert Sheaffer, a noted writer on the topic and a UFO skeptic. There are already numerous networks of meteor cameras set up today across the United States and other countries, he told Space.com.For example, the American Meteor Society maintains an extensive all-sky camera registry. In addition, many astronomy groups and private observatories operate their own sky cameras to record meteorological phenomena and meteors, Sheaffer pointed out.Sheaffer's take-home: ""The people setting up UFO cameras apparently do not realize that there are already extensive automated camera networks all across the globe. But somehow astronomers' cameras do not record UFOs, just meteors. Those setting up 'UFO cameras' are fooling themselves if they think they will record objects that astronomers' cameras do not.""Point of fact: In August of last year, the Pentagon announced the formation of a UAP task force to gain insight into the nature and origins of UFOs. The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAP that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.Concerning the UAP situation, Scott Miller, chair and professor of aerospace engineering at Wichita State University in Kansas, offers an interesting point of view.""I have been trying to follow the UAP stories. I suspect many sightings are still related to secret, not necessarily classified, aircraft activities, Miller said. ""Interestingly, I strongly suspect all of the major defense contractors, and many new ones, have expanded their abilities to rapidly prototype vehicles.""Miller's view focuses on contractors eager to attract U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) dollars by building and flying their own technology demonstrators. ""There are likely lots of non-government funded vehicles that have, are, or will be flying,"" he said.There are some UAP sightings that are very interesting, and potentially not related to new secret aircraft, Miller said. ""However, keep in mind that if we had seen an early Have Blue stealth fighter back in the '70s, we would have said there is no way it's an airplane.""The famous Navy ""Tic Tac"" UAP videos are interesting and perplexing, Miller said, but there are a number of things he's confused about. ""Specifically, why is it only the Navy that has seen the Tic Tacs? I believe the Air Force and Marines fly in the same airspace,"" he said. ""Also, I think all of the Navy sightings were from F-18 E/F Super Hornet models. Is there something about the systems in these E/F series aircraft that facilitates a UAP sighting, for example, radar signal processing glitches, etc.?""The aviation world, Miller suspects, is at a cusp. ""We have the potential to design, build and fly new vehicles in months, not years. The aircraft won't necessarily be ready for production, but they can be used as technology demonstrators. I expect companies and DoD have looked at lots of cool new things,"" he said.For more information on Sky Hub and the ""how-tos"" for constructing your own detection/tracking equipment, go to https://skyhub.org/.Leonard David is author of the recently released book, ""Moon Rush: The New Space Race"" published by National Geographic in May 2019.

87,"The Air Force Is Having To Reverse Engineer Parts Of Its Own Stealth Bomber - Twenty-one years after the last Spirit was delivered, the Air Force is working out how to build the exotic spare parts the bomber requires.",Transportation,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39537/the-air-force-needs-to-reverse-engineer-parts-of-its-own-stealth-bomber,"In a surprising turn of events, the United States government is calling upon its country’s industry to reverse engineer components for the Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. An official call for this highly unusual kind of assistance was put out today on the U.S. government’s contracting website beta.SAM.gov.Mark Thompson, a national-security analyst at the Project On Government Oversight, brought our attention to the notice, which seeks an engineering effort that will reverse engineer key parts for the B‐2’s Load Heat Exchangers. While it is not exactly clear what part of the aircraft’s many complex and exotic subsystems these heat exchangers relate to, the bomber has no shortage of avionics systems, for example, which could require cooling.B-2 Spirit refueling at sunset. The notice does provide details of what it expects engineers do to support the upkeep of the silver-bullet stealth bomber fleet:“This engineering effort is to reverse engineer the core of the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers, develop disassembly process to remove defective cores, develop a stacking, vacuum brazing, and welding process to manufacture new heat exchanger cores and to develop a welding process to install the new cores on existing B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers. The requirement includes reverse-engineering the re‐core process for the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers. The B‐2 Load Heat Exchanger (NSN 1660‐01‐350‐8209FW) uses air and Ethylene Glycol Water (EGW) liquid to produce cold air for the cooling system.”“The deliverables will include all technical data related to the heat exchanger disassembly, all technical data related to the cores, all technical data related to the stack up, vacuum brazing, and installation of the cores on existing units. The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed for disassembly, core stack up, core vacuum brazing, post braze processing, core installation. Two (2) government B‐2 Sink Heat Exchangers will be provided as government-furnished property (GFP) to prototype this effort. The two (2) prototype units will be delivered at the completion of the contract to return the GFP. The final design shall meet the testing qualifications specified in the government technical orders (TO). Finally, a qualified source of repair shall be provided that is capable of remanufacturing the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers per the aforementioned deliverables.The second paragraph makes it abundantly clear that this is a classic reverse engineering effort, in which the technology required to be copied is supplied for analysis before the procedures involved in their original production are replicated.While it’s hard to say exactly why this approach is being taken now, it indicates that the original plans for these components are unavailable or the manufacturing processes and tooling used to produce them no longer exists. This could be the result of them having been so secretive that, at some point, they were inadvertently destroyed altogether. They could also have been simply misplaced, or the parts may have been produced by a smaller contractor that has long since disappeared, taking the bespoke tooling with it.A B-2 sits on jacks at Whiteman Air Force Base, awaiting airmen from the 509th Maintenance Squadron to perform checks.This should also be seen in the context of the unique requirements of sustaining the B-2 fleet, 19 of which are combat-coded and only 20 exist, in total. In this previous feature, The War Zone looked at how the bombers each undergo a programmed depot maintenance cycle every nine years, including a general overhaul and a complete reapplication of the aircraft’s special radar-absorbing material skin and paint job. It’s a process that already makes use of innovative processes, such as robotic systems to help install parts and apply coatings, to help improve quality control and reduce the frequency of depot visits.Of course, recent developments in technology potentially make the process of reverse engineering much quicker and more reliable, too. Earlier this year, it was reported that the Air Force’s Rapid Sustainment Office (RSO) was looking to industry for a “cutting-edge, automated 3D scanning system,” specifically intended to replicate aircraft parts that are no longer in production, including at maintenance depots.A 574th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron maintainer performs depot maintenance on an F-22 at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The 574th installed the first metallic 3D printed part on an operational F-22 in December 2018.In the case of the B-2 scenario, we might imagine how a 3D scanner would be used to scan the original parts and produce a virtual model. From this, at least in part, would then be derived a new set of blueprints that could be reproduced by machine processes and other current manufacturing techniques, yielding a new source of heat exchangers required for ongoing sustainment.One of the B-2’s stablemates in Air Force Global Strike Command, the veteran B-52H Stratofortress, has also benefitted from reverse engineering. In this case, Mission Support Inc. received an Air Force contract to overhaul the aircraft’s engine bypass ducts. With insufficient technical data, the company turned to modern computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology to ensure the new components fitted correctly.Similar initiatives are already underway within the Air Force. The 402nd Electronic Maintenance Group Reverse Engineering Avionics Redesign and Manufacturing team, or REARM, is found at Warner Robins Air Logistic Complex (ALC) at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. Its role is to ensure spare parts supply for older weapons systems.Damon Brown, 402nd Electronic Maintenance Group Reverse Engineering, Avionics Redesign and Manufacturing chief, with a circuit board for a B-52 that is team redesigned, replacing five circuit cards inside the Cold War-era bomber.“The first part of reverse engineering is to do an obsolescence study,” Damon Brown, 402nd EMXG REARM chief explained in an Air Force press release. “If we cannot get or find the parts to fix a piece of equipment or replace it, then we go back to the customer or the supply chain with this item and ask them what they want us to do.”Working on behalf of the Air Force Sustainment Center, similar REARM teams are also found at Oklahoma City ALC at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and at Ogden ALC at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Indeed, as the average age of the Air Force fleet continues to increase, there are only likely to be more such requirements for parts that are long out of production. Before he stood down, the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Will Roper, told
Air Force Magazine of his desire for a “digital representation of every part in the Air Force inventory.”The B-2 “Spirit of Pennsylvania” during a programmed depot maintenance stay at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.During his tenure, Roper was also keen to increasingly leverage commercial industry practices into this kind of military sustainment, with a view to driving down sustainment costs.“We want to reverse-engineer parts that we may not have the designs for anymore,” Roper said. “We want to look at repeatability of parts so that we’re not critically coupled to an individual printing machine. And we want to look at the entire process of what it takes to get a novelty manufactured part onto a critical mission airplane or satellite.”The Rapid Sustainment Office’s Advanced Manufacturing Olympics last October saw plenty of 3D printing, but also called upon reverse engineering. In one event, teams had to replicate as many parts as possible from a box of components using reverse engineering and modeling.All in all, the search for reverse-engineered components for the B-2 fleet is keeping with the Air Force’s current trend of moving toward the latest digital engineering and manufacturing techniques to help ensure its aircraft can be sustained not just easier and more cheaply, but in some cases, possibly at all. Above all else, it underscores how America's tiny fleet of aging stealth bombers, which were largely built on highly experimental technology at the time of their fielding, is a uniquely obvious candidate for using reverse engineering to keep it flying. For something as critical as a heat exchanger, which is essential to keeping the jet in the air, these new processes and techniques may have come just in time. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com

The investigation will cover whether the terms are unfair, and whether they violate the UK's competition laws.  In 2019, Spotify accused Apple of using its App Store policies to hold Spotify back, since the service competed directly with its Apple Music. It also criticized Apple for taking a 30% cut of subscriptions. In June, the EU's competition commission opened two antitrust probes focusing on Apple Pay and the App Store.Apple didn't comment but referred to a 2019 blog post disputing Spotify's claims, saying that everyone in the App Store is playing by the same set of rules. Representatives for the EU commission declined to comment. "

					From podcasts to Clubhouse, branded audio is more important than ever. Learn how brands are increasing customer loyalty and personalization with these best practices.				Join Transform 2021 for the most important themes in enterprise AI & Data. Learn more.In 2018, Uber AI Labs introduced Go-Explore, a family of algorithms that beat the Atari game Montezuma’s Revenge, a commonly accepted reinforcement learning challenge. Last year, Go-Explore was used to beat text-based games.Now researchers from OpenAI and Uber AI Labs say Go-Explore has solved all previously unsolved games in the Atari 2600 benchmark from the Arcade Learning Environment, a collection of more than 50 games, including Pitfall and Pong. Go-Explore also quadruples the state-of-the-art score performance on Montezuma’s Revenge.Training agents to navigate complex environments has long been considered a challenge for reinforcement learning. Success in these areas has accounted for some major machine learning milestones, like DeepMind’s AlphaGo or OpenAI’s Dota 2 beating human champions.Researchers envision recent Go-Explore advances being applied to language models but also used for drug design and robotics trained to navigate the world safely. In simulations, a robotic arm was able to successfully pick up an object and put it on one of four shelves, two of which are behind doors with latches. The ability to complete this transfer, they say, proves the policy approach is not simply leveraging the ability to restore a previously held state in a reinforcement learning environment, but a “function of its overall design.”“The insights presented in this work extend broadly; the simple decomposition of remembering previously found states, returning to them, and then exploring from them appears to be especially powerful, suggesting it may be a fundamental feature of learning in general. Harnessing these insights, either within or outside of the context of Go-Explore, may be essential to improve our ability to create generally intelligent agents,” reads a paper on the research published last week in Nature.Researchers theorize that part of the problem is that agents in reinforcement learning environments forget how to get to places they have previously been (known as detachment) and generally fail to return to a state before exploring from it (known as derailment).“To avoid detachment, Go-Explore builds an ‘archive’ of the different states it has visited in the environment, thus ensuring that states cannot be forgotten. Starting from an archive containing only the initial state, it builds this archive iteratively,” the paper reads. “By first returning before exploring, Go-Explore avoids derailment by minimizing exploration when returning (thus minimizing failure to return) after which it can focus purely on exploration.”Last year Jeff Clune, who cofounded Uber AI Labs in 2017 before moving to OpenAI last year, told VentureBeat that catastrophic forgetting is the Achilles’ heel of deep learning. Solving this problem, he said at the time, could offer humans a faster path to artificial general intelligence (AGI).In other recent news, OpenAI shared more details about multimodal model CLIPS this week, and the AI Index, compiled in part by former OpenAI policy director Jack Clark, was released on Wednesday. The annual index chronicles AI performance progress, as well as trends in startup investment, education, diversity, and policy.

93,Thousands of Android and iOS Apps Leak Data From the Cloud,Privacy,https://www.wired.com/story/ios-android-leaky-apps-cloud/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Lily Hay NewmanTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.For years, simple setup errors have been a  major source of exposure when companies keep data in the cloud. Instead of carefully restricting who can access the information stored in their cloud infrastructure, organizations too often misconfigure their defenses. It's the digital equivalent of leaving the windows or doors open at your house before going on a long vacation. That leaky data problem applies to more than just the web services that typically grab headlines. Mobile security firm Zimperium has found that these exposures pose a major problem for iOS and Android apps as well.Zimperium ran automated analysis on more than 1.3 million Android and iOS apps to detect common cloud misconfigurations that exposed data. The researchers found almost 84,000 Android apps and nearly 47,000 iOS apps using public cloud services—like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure—in their backend as opposed to running their own servers. Of those, the researchers found misconfigurations in 14 percent of those totals—11,877 Android apps and 6,608 iOS apps—exposing users' personal information, passwords, and even medical information.“It's a disturbing trend,” says Shridhar Mittal, Zimperium's CEO. “A lot of these apps have cloud storage that was not configured properly by the developer or whoever set things up and, because of that, data is visible to just about anyone. And most of us have some of these apps right now.”The researchers reached out to a handful of the app makers they found with cloud exposures, but they say the response was minimal and many apps still have exposed data. This is why Zimperium isn't naming affected apps in their report. Additionally, the researchers can't notify tens of thousands of developers. Mittal says, though, that the services they looked at run the gamut from apps with a few thousand users to those with a few million. One of the apps in question is a mobile wallet from a Fortune 500 company that's exposing some user session information and financial data. Another is a transportation app from a large city that's exposing payment data. The researchers also found medical apps with test results and even users' profile images out in the open.Given that Zimperium found nearly 20,000 apps with cloud misconfigurations, the company didn't attempt to individually assess whether attackers have already discovered and abused any of the exposures. But these open doors and windows would be easy for bad actors to find using the same publicly available information that Zimperium used in its research. Hacking groups already do this type of scanning to find cloud misconfigurations in web services. And Mittal says that, in addition to sensitive user data, the researchers also found network credentials, system configuration files, and server architecture keys in some of the exposed app storage that attackers could potentially use to gain deeper access to an organization's digital systems.On top of all of that, the researchers found that some of the misconfigurations would allow bad actors to change or overwrite data, creating additional potential for fraud and disruption.Though major cloud providers like AWS have made an effort to proactively detect possible misconfigurations and warn customers about them, it ultimately comes down to developers and IT administrators checking to confirm that things are set up as intended.“It absolutely makes sense that misconfiguration could be a widespread issue,” says Will Strafach, a longtime iOS security researcher and creator of the Guardian Firewall app. ""I've seen AWS buckets with bad permissions, and I've also seen multiple VPN nodes exposing data. I've seen a lot of apps from companies who should know better that have horrible security issues.”Zimperium is one of three mobile security firms that participates in Google's App Defense Alliance initiative, conducting automated app scanning for the company's Google Play store. Zimperium's Mittal says the company uses the same tools for the App Defense Alliance work that the researchers used in their investigation of cloud misconfigurations. But when scanning for the Alliance, Zimperium looks for potentially malicious functionality rather than accidental exposures.Mittal hopes that raising awareness about mobile cloud misconfigurations will motivate developers to take a closer look at their infrastructure and flip a few switches to lock things down. But given how difficult it can be to reach the right person within an organization—and how common it is for companies to outsource the development of their own apps—it will likely take time to solve the problem. “For users, their personally identifying information could be exposed, medical information, test results, phone numbers, even passwords to certain accounts,"" Mittall says. ""And for enterprises this creates risk, too. Attackers could gather information that helps them hack in deeper.”There are a lot of security protections that are difficult to implement and that organizations may even intentionally avoid, like patching always-on systems or replacing vulnerable hardware. When it comes to dealing with cloud misconfigurations, though, most apps will just need to check some boxes to significantly improve their data privacy and security.WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

94,"Bionaut Labs launches with plans to attack brain tumors with tiny, guided robots",Biotechnology,https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bionaut-labs-launches-plans-to-attack-brain-tumors-tiny-guided-robots,"The robots are coming: After working under the radar for four years, Bionaut Labs is raising the curtain on its tiny, remote-controlled devices, built to travel through the human body and deliver a dose of medicine where it’s needed the most.Smaller than a millimeter and with a few moving parts, the tiny voyagers are designed to navigate through tissues and go where today’s surgeons cannot, such as when dealing with hard-to-reach cancers.Their success would be a big step toward the fantastic future promised by decades of science fiction—but at its core, according to founder and CEO Michael Shpigelmacher, it’s an idea that is eminently practical.“When there was a revolution in surgical robotics 10 to 20 years ago, the whole concept was built on complicated, multijointed robotic arms,” Shpigelmacher said in an interview. “As you look at the evolution of that industry, it's gone from one arm, to two arms, to five arms … companies are going for more robotic arms with more degrees of freedom.” “Our paradigm is actually the opposite. We're saying move to a different category—where there are no robotic arms, and as many degrees of freedom as you want—but it’s just by controlling the tip,” he said. “As a company, we think that technically and medically this is the more elegant solution.”Imagine a miniature screw that, as it rotates, can push its way through the body’s inner spaces until it reaches its target, releases a drug and then returns the way it came. But rather than rotating it with a screwdriver, the tool is invisible and guided only by magnetic fields generated outside the body.This allows the small devices, dubbed Bionauts themselves, to overcome the obvious constraint that holds back surgical drills, probes and needles: once they’re in the body, they can’t turn.“Typical brain procedures today are significantly more invasive than the Bionaut procedure, and they're definitely less accurate and precise in terms of their trajectory—because they are limited to taking linear paths,” Shpigelmacher said. In fact, a common biopsy diagnostic procedure may use a needle wider than a Bionaut and take core samples through healthy brain tissue on its straight line to a tumor.To start, the company aims to tackle gliomas of the brainstem. The aggressive tumor is mostly diagnosed at a young age and can be particularly difficult to treat due to its dense and sensitive surroundings, which help regulate the body’s heartbeat and breathing.By traveling up the spine or through the brain’s reservoirs of cerebrospinal fluid, Bionaut Labs hopes to safely navigate to the cancer and unlock a mechanism that delivers chemotherapies directly—or any established drug payload that may have wider side effects when given intravenously or has trouble crossing the protective barriers between the bloodstream and the brain.“Because of the anatomy, you cannot reach the middle of a patient’s brainstem in a way that is not going to harm them significantly today,” he said. “This way, you can get higher drug concentrations in situ, while you get much lower to nonexistent concentrations in the plasma.”So far, the Los Angeles-based company has conducted preclinical studies on small and large live animals, showing no long-term neurological damage from the Bionauts. Now, the company has raised $20 million to help take it to the next step and lock down the design of its technologies before moving into human clinical trials planned for 2023.“We are thrilled to bring Bionaut Labs out of stealth mode as it typifies the type of new impactful technology companies we like to help build,” said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, which led Bionauts’ latest financing alongside backing from Upfront Ventures, Revolution, BOLD Capital and Compound.“Bionauts hold great promise as a new targeted treatment modality for severe brain disorders for which there are few, if any, effective treatment options,” Khosla added. “Moreover, the broad therapeutic potential of Bionauts extends to many diseases where conventional therapies are limited or lacking.”The company also plans to explore its potential against neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, before one day tackling acute conditions like stroke, using a range of Bionauts with different shapes and characteristics.   “What’s even more exciting is that the anatomical targeting capabilities of the Bionaut platform make new therapeutic technologies such as antisense, siRNA, gene therapy, CRISPR-Cas9, and oncolytic viruses viable in challenging clinical settings,” said Errol DeSouza, head of the company’s advisory board and co-founder of Neurocrine Biosciences.And along the way, Shpigelmacher hopes to convince physicians and patients that the idea of tiny robots helping heal the body from within can be more science than fiction after all.“It makes the discussion much simpler when—instead of talking about a spaceship flying around your brain—you say: ‘We're treating this condition, it's brainstem glioma; this is the payload, you know this payload; and we’re going to move X centimeters in and X centimeters out and deliver this thing,” he said. “It becomes extremely tangible and grounds it.”

Google clocked an increase of 22% in advertising revenue to $46.2 billion in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. The result exceeded Wall Street estimates.Google first said early last year that it would get rid of third-party cookies, which for decades have enabled online ads. The move was designed to meet growing data-privacy concern in Europe and the U.S.""Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers,"" Temkin added in the blog post.Google said that next year it planned to stop using or investing in tracking technologies that uniquely identify web users as they browse the internet.""This points to a future where there is no need to sacrifice relevant advertising and monetization in order to deliver a private and secure experience,"" Temkin said. Google accounted for 52% of last year’s global digital ad spending of $292 billion, according to Jounce Media, a digital-ad consultancy, The Wall Street Journal reported.Vidhi Choudhary is a recent graduate in Business Journalism from Columbia University.

97,Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools,Hardware,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Stephen Nellis, Hyunjoo Jin5 Min Read(Reuters) - Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor makes chips for automakers and is booked beyond capacity. But expanding production lines to help solve a chip shortage that is shutting down car factories around the world is not feasible - in part due to the scarcity of older-style chipmaking machinery.Chip factories like Polar use these tools to make chips on 200-millimeter silicon wafers, which were state-of-the-art two decades ago. Now, advanced chips are made using much larger wafers, but there is still a lot of demand for simpler, older chips.The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. General Motors Co on Wednesday extended production cuts at three North American plants and added a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis warned the pain could linger far into the year. Shortages forced Ford Motor Co to slash shifts for production of its F-150 pickup truck, a longtime profit driver.Automakers use a range of chips in cars. Some, such as those in infotainment systems, are made in the same cutting-edge chip factories that make smartphone chips. But other chips in braking and engine systems are made using older, proven technologies that meet automakers’ durability and reliability requirements.But the machines to make those older chips can take six to nine months to find, said Surya Iyer, vice president of operations and quality at Polar.“There’s no way I can expand capacity beyond just stretching my limits,” Iyer said. “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”Resellers of chipmaking gear saying they cannot find used equipment, leading some buyers to stalk old factories in the United States, Japan and Europe, waiting for them to close in hopes of snapping up the gear inside.“Demand is hot for used equipment, but we don’t have enough of them to cope with demand,” said Bruce Kim, chief executive of South Korea’s SurplusGLOBAL, one of the largest dealers of used chipmaking gear.He said used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.Ohio-based Rite Track, in normal times, buys up old chipmaking equipment, upgrades it and sells it to chip factories. But Chief Executive Tim Hayden said the recent squeeze has spurred the company to spend more time sending technicians out to upgrade tools that are already installed on factory floors in order to squeeze more chips out of them.“You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available,” Hayden said. “So people are getting a little bit more creative.”Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory. Spin Memory in Fremont, California, is designing a new kind of memory chip and maintains a small “pilot production line,” mostly to provide samples to potential customers, said Chief Executive Tom Sparkman. Even though Spin Memory’s tools use 20-year-old technology, Sparkman gets offers to buy them almost every day.“We haven’t taken the plunge to get rid of it yet, but some days it’s tempting,” he said.Toolmakers such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp, meanwhile, are building booming businesses by refurbishing or recreating some of their greatest hits from the 1990s and earlier.“It’s really exploding,” said Mike Rosa, head of strategic and technical marketing for a group at Applied Materials, the world’s biggest chip-equipment vendor.David Haynes, a managing director at Lam Research, said demand for 200-millimeter tools was once mostly from China as it worked to build up its domestic chipmaking industry. Now, he said, customers from around the world are looking to buy or upgrade older tools.Still, investment in older technology lags relative to the spending on more advanced production lines, or “nodes” as they are known in the industry.“Most of the capital expenditure has been going into advanced nodes,” said Tyson Tuttle, chief executive of Silicon Laboratories Inc, which designs automotive chips to be made on older technology. Chipmakers “have always relied on the fact that the digital guys move out of the older nodes, and that frees up capacity for all the support chips. The problem is, the digital guys aren’t moving out as fast.

98,Here’s what Twitter’s rumored ‘undo send’ feature could look like,Social Media,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314973/twitter-undo-send-interface-leak-paid-feature-rumor-app-researcher,"Filed under:A work-in-progress interface has been unearthedA potential animation for Twitter’s long-rumored “undo send” feature has been discovered by app researcher Jane Manchun Wong, giving us our best look yet at how it might work. The interface shows Twitter’s familiar “Your Tweet was sent” dialog above a new “Undo” button. The undo button doubles as a progress bar, which appears to show you how long you have to undo a tweet before it gets sent. Gmail offers a similar option for emails, where it provides a short window to stop messages from being sent after clicking the “Send” button. Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0“Undo send” has been a rumored part of a paid Twitter subscription tier after it was first mentioned in a user survey last year. It might not be the “edit button” that Twitter users have been requesting forever (and which will probably never happen), but it would still offer users the ability to quickly stop a tweet from posting if they spot a last second typo or Bad Take.Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Twitter is exploring paid subscriptions as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue in response to competition from Facebook and Snapchat. The subscriptions could include access to features like “undo send” and profile customization options, it said. Bloomberg also reported that Twitter was exploring ways for users to pay one another for exclusive content, a feature the company later announced as Super Follows.Jane Manchun Wong is an app researcher who digs through code to find unreleased and unannounced features. Last year she was among the first to spot Twitter’s Birdwatch initiative to allow users to root out misinformation on its service, and she also spotted Twitter’s overhaul of its verification system prior to its official announcement.A newsletter about computers"
99,"Betting on death of petrol cars, Volvo to go all electric by 2030",Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-volvo-electric/betting-on-death-of-petrol-cars-volvo-to-go-all-electric-by-2030-idUSKBN2AU0AU,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Nick Carey, Helena Soderpalm3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Volvo’s entire car lineup will be fully electric by 2030, the Chinese-owned company said on Tuesday, joining a growing number of automakers planning to phase out fossil-fuel engines by the end of this decade.“I am totally convinced there will be no customers who really want to stay with a petrol engine,” Volvo Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson told reporters when asked about future demand for electric vehicles. “We are convinced that an electric car is more attractive for customers.”The Swedish-based carmaker said 50% of its global sales should be fully-electric cars by 2025 and the other half hybrid models.Owned by Hangzhou-based Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, Volvo will launch a new family of electric cars in the next few years, all of which will be sold online only.On Tuesday it unveiled the first of those models, the C40, a fully electric SUV, which will have an initial battery range of around 420 kilometres (261 miles).Volvo will include wireless upgrades and fixes for its new electric models - an approach originally pioneered by electric carmaker Tesla Inc. This means the C40’s range will be extended over time with software upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Henrik Green said.Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.Last month, Ford Motor Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.In November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, said its models would be all electric by 2030.Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, employment in the car industry is expected to shrink.Volvo CEO Samuelsson said that industry-wide, electrification will mostly affect engine plants and auto suppliers providing everything from oil filters to fuel injectors and spark plugs.“Those are a lot of jobs of course,” he said. “But overall I don’t think there will be a big difference.”Volvo said it will “radically reduce” the complexity of its model line-up and provide customers with transparent pricing.The carmaker’s global network of 2,400 traditional bricks-and-mortar dealers will remain open to service vehicles and to help customers make online orders.So far Volvo has not been affected by a pandemic-fueled global semiconductor chip shortage that has temporarily shut a number of assembly plants, which Samuelsson said was thanks to constant communication with suppliers.“So far, knock on wood, we have not had to stop any assembly line,” he said. “But it could happen any day.”Reporting By Nick Carey; editing by Barbara Lewis, Gerry Doyle and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

100,More than 50 companies have vowed to be carbon-neutral by 2040,Business,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/05/more-than-50-companies-have-vowed-be-carbon-neutral-by-2040/,"Amazon, Walmart, General Motors, and now FedEx.The giant delivery company joined more than 50 other major corporations when it announced this week that it too aims to be carbon-neutral by 2040 — an effort to curb climate change. Executives say that a gathering cultural change is fueled by companies responding not only to shareholders but to the growing urgency of climate change and the concerns of their own employees and customers.On Wednesday, FedEx promised to be carbon-neutral by 2040, 10 years faster than the timeline laid out by the Paris climate accord. The company pledged an initial investment of $2 billion to start electrifying its massive fleet of more than 180,000 vehicles and $100 million for a new Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.“We talk to our customers pretty much each and every day about these issues,” said Mitch Jackson, Fedex’s chief sustainability officer. “Sustainability is not a discretionary thing anymore. I think it’s really become central to a lot of the considerations in thinking.”Some of the companies promising to meet that goal and inspire other firms to do the same have signed on to an initiative called the Climate Pledge, co-founded by Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. Those companies include IBM, Microsoft, Unilever, Johnson Controls, Coca-Cola, Uber and Best Buy. Acciona, a Spanish energy and infrastructure company, went carbon-neutral in 2016.Carbon neutrality means companies must rely entirely on renewable fuels or offset the burning of fossil fuels with the capture and storage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Yet even the prodigious voluntary steps by a portion of the corporate world lack the speed, scale or scientific know-how needed to move the thermometer of the warming planet very far in the right direction without government support or broader behavioral changes in the private sector.FedEx, for example, plans to electrify all its delivery vehicles by 2040, but only half of new purchases will be electric by 2025, and many older vehicles will remain on the road for years. Moreover, by 2040 the electrical grids where FedEx recharges its vehicles might still be relying on natural gas, meaning they would not be entirely emission-free.The company’s website also boasts of an improvement in carbon “intensity,” but the steady growth in FedEx’s business means its greenhouse gas emissions have increased slightly in absolute terms from 2017 to 2019. And the company’s donation to Yale’s new research center is a generous acknowledgment that the current state of carbon capture and storage knowledge is still in the research and development stage.Even if FedEx delivers on its promise of net carbon neutrality, it will remove less than 0.3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.FedEx Chairman Frederick W. Smith acknowledged the scope of the challenge. Companies have to deal with the problem of climate change “at a scale that just boggles the mind,” he said on a video conference call with Yale administrators.Raj Subramaniam, FedEx’s president and chief operating officer, said on the same video call that the company’s effort to reach carbon neutrality had “far-reaching impacts for our customers, our industry and indeed our planet.” He said that “climate change is bigger than any one business.”“There’s an arms race underway for pledges of net neutrality. It’s impressive,” said David Victor, professor of international law and regulation at the University of California at San Diego. “What we’re seeing are big visible companies making announcements. They are bigger, better-organized and more exposed in terms of brand value.”But Victor cautioned that “these are exploratory big shifts in corporate culture and goals. Making this a reality means doing it with smaller companies and supply chains and stuff that hasn’t been worked out yet.”Action by big utilities, refiners and concrete manufacturers are also essential if countries are going to meet their own economy-wide goals. Though many of them have already taken steps to reduce carbon emissions, these companies remain the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.Getting to 2040 greenhouse gas emission goals is in some ways more difficult for public companies than past emission-reduction efforts, which could be explained as money-saving energy-efficiency measures. In the future there will be more pressure to undertake steps that will cost money rather than save it.“There is a difference between energy efficiency and this,” Victor said of climate actions. “This is looking far beyond that. Net zero does not mean efficiency; it means complete transformation, and that’s the challenge.”One major issue for FedEx, as well as other types of air carriers, is how to deal with the fuel used in planes. There are a variety of biofuels and synthetic fuels and newer jets use lighter materials, but given current technology, shipping packages around the world requires sending a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and probably still will in 2040. Overall, the company’s operations will still generate greenhouse gases.That’s where the money for Yale — where FedEx chief executive Smith graduated in 1966 — comes in. FedEx, like some other companies, is searching for novel ways to remove and store more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by using nature. Yale researchers plan to look at agricultural planting techniques to increase capture in soil; developing plants with larger or faster absorption of carbon dioxide; and weathering rocks in a way that locks in carbon.“Earth’s natural systems are ripe with opportunities,” said Ingrid C. “Indy” Burke, dean of the Yale School of the Environment. “These natural solutions must be used as part of a portfolio of methods to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.”“Carbon capture is one potential tool at a time when humanity urgently needs to know more about all the potential tools that we have at our disposal to address the climate crisis,” Paul Sabin, a professor of environmental history at Yale, said in an email. But he warned that “carbon capture research also should not become an excuse for doubling down on fossil fuel consumption, or delaying urgently needed policies to move away from fossil fuel consumption, including the electrification of transportation.”Sabin also noted that carbon capture “involves ethical considerations related to the control and transformation of rural landscapes, with serious consequences for indigenous and rural communities worldwide.”The appeal of carbon capture is that a company could balance out its remaining fuel emissions against carbon captured from the atmosphere and stored either underground or in some other form. But while there are a handful of companies that are giving cause for some optimism currently, there are very few commercial carbon-capture companies or projects because so far capturing carbon directly from the atmosphere is costly and uses more energy in the process.So a key element of air carriers’ plans is looking to the new technologies.Jackson, FedEx’s chief sustainability officer, said the company is hoping that Yale can help get it to the finish line and bring a big return on the donation.“The idea for that is to have some of the smartest people in the country, in the world, working on these intractable, intractable problems,” he said. “We think it will help us. We think it will help the industry. And that’s why we made the investment.”“You see some real live investment in carbon removal,” said University of Chicago economist Michael Greenstone, who served as chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration. “But we’re in the top of the first inning on carbon removal, so we don’t know what that’s going to deliver yet.”Meanwhile, pledges from the corporate world continue to roll in.“I think there’s been a breathtaking change that’s taken place,” says Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. But the change, he said, is a shift in the public demand for action at all levels. And companies are recognizing it.“They seem to be thinking: ‘We probably better get on board and do something that’s going to be reasonable for us in terms of cost before we really get hit over the head.’""The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"
101,Arizona House passes bill that threatens Apple and Google’s app stores,Software,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/arizona-house-passes-bill-that-threatens-apple-and-googles-app-stores-.html,"The Arizona House of Representatives voted 31-29 on Wednesday to pass a bill that will require app stores to allow app makers to use their own payment processing software, avoiding fees charged by Apple and Google.The vote is a setback for Apple, which opposed it, and a victory for the Coalition for App Fairness, a group representing app makers upset with the app stores, which backed the bill.The legislation still has a lot of challenges to overcome before it becomes state law. First, the Arizona Senate has to discuss and pass the legislation. Then, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey would have a choice to veto the bill. If it becomes law, Arizona will have to grapple with questions including how Apple or Google will comply, or if it would be challenged in court.The vote comes weeks after the North Dakota state senate voted against passing a similar bill.The Arizona bill, HB 2005, targeted Apple's fees by requiring companies that run app stores with over a million downloads per year to allow apps to offer alternative payment processors, enabling developers to avoid fees ranging from 15% to 30%. The bill would apply to companies and users in Arizona.While the bill didn't specify any companies, it was clearly targeted at Apple's App Store, which approves any app that runs on iPhones, and the Google Play app store for Android phones, which takes 30% of sales of digital goods from Android apps. Discussion of the bill in the Arizona House focused mostly on Apple, with some discussion of Google. The bill exempted digital software stores for game consoles or music players.""I think they have a monopoly on the market right now,"" Republican Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, who sponsored the bill, said. ""There isn't anybody in here that doesn't have a Google Android or Apple phone, I guarantee it.""Other legislators opposed the bill on other grounds, including a rushed process, questions over whether it's a federal issue, and a concern that the legislation would be challenged in federal court because it could conflict with the U.S. constitution.""Arizona does not have an interest in this fight,"" Democratic Arizona State Rep. Diego Rodriguez said. ""We don't have a dog in this fight, what we need to do is be focused on policies that are protecting consumers. This bill does not protect consumers, it protects a $1 billion company from another billion-dollar company.""Apple opposed the Arizona bill, and Kyle Andeer, Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, said at a hearing last week that it amounts to a ""government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.""""This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store's value for free—even if they're selling digital goods, even if they're making millions or even billions of dollars doing it,"" Andeer said.Apple and Google representatives declined to comment.Arizona's bill is the latest effort to regulate Apple's App Store, which has come under fire for its strict rules and fees for digital purchases, which some software makers say is unfair and anticompetitive.State legislatures have become a battleground and similar legislation is being considered in states including Georgia and Minnesota.Arizona's bill was backed by the Coalition for App Fairness, which includes software companies like Spotify, Match Group, and Epic Games, which have chafed under Apple's control of its App Store and want Apple to reduce its fees, open up iPhones for alternative app stores, and permit alternative payment processes.""The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,"" said Meghan DiMuzio, executive director for the Coalition for App Fairness.Last year, Epic Games filed antitrust lawsuits against Apple and Google that are currently working through the courts, focusing on many of the same issues, such as giving software makers the option to use their own payment processor.In October, the House Judiciary Subcommittee released a report that said that Apple has ""monopoly power"" over iPhone apps, which it uses to generate outsized profits.In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against Apple in a case that opened up the possibility of consumer lawsuits against Apple's app store for allegedly inflating app prices.The scrutiny appears to be having an effect on Apple's App Store policies. Late last year, Apple introduced a new program that reduced its fee from App Store sales from 30% to 15% for companies that make less than $1 million per year on the App Store, addressing some complaints.Got a confidential news tip?

103,How to make your smart TV a little dumb (and why you should),Privacy,https://mashable.com/article/how-to-stop-smart-tv-from-spying-on-me-disable-automatic-content-recognition/,"Privacy Please is an ongoing series exploring the ways privacy is violated in the modern world, and what can be done about it.When it comes to your television set, brains are overrated. Smart TVs have long dominated the home entertainment marketplace, with internet access and the built-in ability to play content from streaming services like Netflix considered a must for any modern device. But as is often the case when it comes to the relentless drive to connect the world, when you load your gadgets up with both cameras and behind-the-scenes monitoring tech, and then connect them to the internet, you get a lot more than you pay for. You're probably aware that smart TVs have a bit of a reputation when it comes to invading their owners' privacy as a matter of course. In 2014, a Salon editorial highlighted the fact that even then some smart TV manuals contained language warning customers about discussing ""sensitive information"" in front of their televisions. The embedded microphones on Samsung smart TVs, as the Daily Beast later reported in 2015, were likely sending voice commands to third parties to convert speech to text. What we didn't know at the time, and what we do know now, is that text-to-voice systems — like those used by Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple — for years relied on real humans listening to customers' voice commands (and many likely still do). And, at least in the case of Amazon's Alexa, devices in the past often started recording without a wake word prompt. And that's just the tip of the privacy-sinking iceberg. ""Beyond the risk that your TV manufacturer and app developers may be listening and watching you, that television can also be a gateway for hackers to come into your home,"" the FBI warned in 2019. ""In a worst-case scenario, they can turn on your bedroom TV's camera and microphone and silently cyberstalk you.""But even slapping tape over your smart TV's camera and disabling the mic isn't enough to protect your in-home privacy.Many modern TVs come pre-loaded with something called automatic content recognition (ACR) software. You'd be forgiven for never having come across this particular term before, and that's most definitely part of the problem. So what is ACR? A look at Samsung's privacy policy provides a real-world explanation. ""In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our feature and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information,"" explains the policy, dated Jan. 1, 2021. ""Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information.""In other words, imagine some ad executive standing over you ever time you turn on your TV, recording in minute detail everything you watch and for how long, and then sending (or possibly selling) that data to any number of third parties that you've never heard of but who now posses your IP address (which can be tied back to your name) linked to your viewing habits.Vizio's privacy policy, for example, makes clear that your data is likely not staying just with Vizio. ""When ACR collection is turned on, we may share Viewing Data with authorized data partners including analytics companies, media companies and advertisers,"" it explains. ""Viewing Data is sometimes enhanced with household demographic data and data about digital actions (e.g. digital purchases and other consumer behavior taken by devices associated with the IP Address we collect).""Sounds creepy, right? And when you think about what companies might be able to infer from your viewing habits — your religious and political beliefs, your income level, your marital status, your proclivity for specific types of pornography — it gets even creepier.Thankfully, there's a solution that doesn't involve a brick. When it comes to turning off ACR on your smart TV, there's the easy way, and then there's the hard way.The easy way — disconnecting your television, permanently, from the internet — also renders your smart TV partially dumb. Which, hey, that might not be so bad. If you're the type of person who has a vast Blu-ray collection, or someone who hooks your laptop up to your TV with an HDMI cable every time you want to stream something, then disconnecting your TV from the internet makes sense. These days, though, many people rely on Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon Prime for their viewing pleasures. In other words, connecting your TV to the internet is nonnegotiable. Thankfully, many smart TVs now offer the option to disable ACR. Frustratingly, the option to do so is often buried deep within a TV's settings and explained with confusing terms — making it a challenge to locate, and, once found, to understand. Oh yeah, and every brand hides this option in a different place. Vizio, for example, offers the following instructions for disabling ACR:Press the MENU button on your TV's remote or open HDTV Settings appSelect SystemSelect Reset & AdminHighlight Viewing DataPress RIGHT arrow to change setting to Off




Clear as a bell.
Image:  vizio
Samsung's smart TV privacy settings are even more buried than Vizio's. According to the company's privacy policy, you'll find the relevant options under Menu > Support > Terms & Policy or Menu > Smart Hub > Terms & Policy.You'll want to disable viewing information services, interest-based advertising, and, for good measure, voice recognition services (these may be under another settings page, titled ""Privacy Choices""). According to its privacy policy, TCL, which makes Roku-enabled TVs, refreshingly doesn't ""collect information on your television viewing habits, on the shows and movies you choose to watch, or on any aggregated data based on your use of the TCL Roku TV."" However, that's not the case with Roku, which specifically says in its privacy policy that it employs ACR.To disable ACR on a Roku TV, the privacy policy says to ""visit your Roku TV's Settings menu (Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience) and de-select 'Use Info from TV Inputs.'""Own something other than a Vizio, Samsung, or Roku-enabled smart TV? No problem. Consumer Reports has a wonderful step-by-step guide for turning off ACR on a bevy of different smart TV brands, including LG, Sony, Hisense, Philips, Sharp, Element, Insignia, and Toshiba.Modern technology increasingly invades consumers' lives in ever-more disturbing fashions, but that doesn't mean you have to make it easy for the companies trying to profit off what few private moments you have left. So spend a few minutes diving into your TVs' convoluted privacy settings, and rest assured that you're at least doing the bare minimum when it comes taking back control of your data. "
104,Apple investigated in UK over 'unfair' App Store claims,Business,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56279514,"The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has launched an investigation into whether Apple's terms for app developers are anti-competitive.It follows a series of complaints, including a high-profile one from Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite.Some developers are unhappy that they are forced to distribute apps to iPhones and iPads via the App Store, and the commission Apple takes.Apple said its terms were ""fair and equal"".The investigation will consider whether Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices and look at whether it imposes unfair terms on developers.Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. So complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice - potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps - warrant careful scrutiny.""In response, Apple said: ""We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place - applied fairly and equally to all developers - to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent. ""We look forward to working with the UK Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers."" Epic Games has launched a legal action against Apple and Google in the US, after both removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores.The row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules.In August Epic bypassed the Apple and Google stores to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores.The row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians.Arizona's state House of Representatives passed a law this week which prohibits Apple and Google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores.The law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in Arizona. It will now be handed to the state Senate for approval.In Europe, Apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies.Fortnite-maker sues Apple and Google in UKApple fires back in Fortnite App Store battleMyanmar asks India to return police who fled coupSeveral officers reportedly crossed the border after refusing to carry out the military junta's orders.US Senate passes $1.9tn Covid-19 relief planIn pictures: Mardi Gras marches on in SydneyThe young rebels risking their lives for the futureThe women saving India's intricate flower embroidery.

106,Local Efforts Underway to Boot Gas-Powered Cars,Transportation,https://www.ecori.org/transportation/2021/3/2/efforts-underway-to-phase-out-gas-powered-cars-in-southern-new-england,"Environmental news for southern New EnglandMassachusetts is working on phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. (istock)Panelist of transportation experts discuss the introduction of electric vehicles in southern New England and internationallyPhasing out gas-powered vehicles is an ambitious but attainable goal in the worldwide race to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and mitigate the climate crisis, according to advocates for electric vehicles.On an international scale, road, rail, air, and marine transportation accounted for more than 24 percent of global climate emissions in 2016. In Rhode Island, that number is considerably higher, with the transportation sector accounting for nearly 40 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions. In Massachusetts, passenger vehicles account for 27 percent of climate pollution.At a Feb. 25 virtual panel hosted by the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, guest speakers discussed the urgency of the situation and assuaged concerns that people may have when it comes to phasing out gas-powered vehicles.“It’s a race to zero,” said Monica Araya, a decarbonization strategist based in the Netherlands. “We are in a hurry, and we are not talking about hybrids, we’re not talking about efficient cars … it’s about zero emissions.”Advocates for cleaner transportation are pushing for 100 percent electric vehicle (EV) car sales by 2035, a movement that is led in the United States by states such as California, where the governor signed an executive order last year phasing out gas vehicles.In Europe, Norway is pushing an even more ambitious agenda of eliminating gas-powered new car sales by 2025, with record EV sales in 2020 and steadily declining gas-powered vehicles sales during the past 10 years.But New England is starting to feel the movement’s rumbles.The recently signed Transportation & Climate Initiative (TCI) puts forward a goal of cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions by 26 percent between 2022 and 2032. The East Coast initiative, at the moment anyway, is a collaboration between Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the District of Columbia  that aims to cap climate emissions and raise money to build EV infrastructure by requiring gas and diesel suppliers to “pay to pollute.”Dan Gatti, director of clean transportation policy for the state of Massachusetts, discussed his state’s efforts to not only abide by TCI but also to have net-zero emissions by 2050 and to phase out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.“We have just one generation to get this right,” he said.  The Ocean State lags behind the Bay State when it comes to a goal of net-zero emissions, with Rhode Island’s current goal being to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050.In comparison with Massachusetts, Rhode Island also falters when it comes to a concrete plan to phase out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles. The only mention of it comes in the state’s Mobility Innovation Working Group’s recently published Clean Transportation and Mobility Innovation Report, which suggests that Rhode Island establish “a goal that, by 2040, all new cars, light duty trucks, and buses sold in Rhode Island will be electric or technology neutral.”However, Mal Skowron, from the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, noted that Rhode Island could soon follow in California’s footsteps and adopt its regulations once they are finalized.“It’s worth remembering that California’s 2035 regulations were announced in September 2020 and are still being written” Skowron wrote in an email to ecoRI News. “We may see more action once the regulations are finalized.”The Thursday afternoon online panel discussion also touched on concerns about affordability of EVs since, as of 2019, the average price for a new all-electric car in the United States was $36,600.Gatti acknowledged that current subsidies aren’t enough for the lower middle-class population, and that governments need to consider how much the average person will be willing to spend.“One area I’m hoping that we can really grow as a state and in our EV policies is for us to take a realistic and hard look at how much we can expect consumers to accept the additional costs associated with making the transition to EVs,” he said. “If we want to get into more middle class, working class kinds of backgrounds, what is the realistic level of subsidy? I don’t think that our current $2,500 is going to get people who are below $75,000 in income.”Janelle London, a panelist and co-executive director of the Seattle-based nonprofit Coltura, said no one will be forced to turn in their old car and buy a new EV, rather, people who can afford to buy a new car will have incentives to buy an EV, and used EVs will trickle down the consumer line.“I think it’s important to remember that these policies are about purchases of new vehicles starting with a certain date,” London said. “This policy doesn’t change the fundamentals of car ownership. As happens today, people with more money will buy the new cars and the rest of us will get a used car. What this policy does is accelerate when those used EVs will get into the market.”The transition to an all-EV fleet, including buses and trucks, will take time, but all panelists concurred that the time to start is now.“We’re getting a little frustrated by all the studies that keep pointing to the same thing,” Larry Chretien, Green Energy Consumers Alliance’s executive director, said. “Now we’re looking for action.”Environmental news for Southern New EnglandAbout   |   Staff & Board   |   Advertise   |   Privacy PolicyecoRI News  //  10 Davol Sq., Suite 100, Providence, RI 02903   //   E-MAIL "

The latest software update for Exchange blocks the hackers, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, to issue a rare emergency directive that requires all government networks do so.CISA, the U.S.'s primary defensive cybersecurity agency, rarely exercises its authority to demand that the entire U.S. government take steps to protect its cybersecurity. The move was necessary, the agency said, because the Exchange hackers are able ""to gain persistent system access."" All government agencies have until noon Friday to download the latest software update.In a separate blog post, Microsoft Vice President Tom Burt wrote that the hackers have recently spied on a wide range of American targets, including disease researchers, law firms and defense contractors.Burt added that the company had seen no evidence that individual consumers were targeted but emphasized that the hacker group has previously targeted ""infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks and NGOs.""Contacted by email, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington referred to recent comments by spokesperson Wang Wenbin.""China has reiterated on multiple occasions that given the virtual nature of cyberspace and the fact that there are all kinds of online actors who are difficult to trace, tracing the source of cyber attacks is a complex technical issue,"" Wang said.""We hope that relevant media and company will adopt a professional and responsible attitude and underscore the importance to have enough evidence when identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than make groundless accusations.""There was no immediate indication that the hack had led to significant exploitation of government computer networks. But the announcement marks the second time in recent months that the U.S. has scrambled to address a widespread hacking campaign believed to be the work of foreign government spies.The U.S. is still sussing out the damage after hackers suspected of being Russian broke into a software management company, SolarWinds, and used the breach to hack nine federal agencies and about 100 private companies, White House deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said in February.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsAs the developer behind the most popular operating system in the world, Windows, Microsoft is regarded by Western cybersecurity experts as having exceptional insight into global hacking campaigns.The campaign gave the hackers access not only to the victims' emails and calendar invitations but also to their entire networks, Microsoft said. The hackers used four distinct ""zero-day"" exploits, which are rare digital tools that get their name because software developers are unaware of them, giving them no days to prepare fixes.ESET, a Slovakian cybersecurity company, said on Twitter that its researchers had seen multiple hacker groups, not just the one Microsoft named in its announcement, that were also exploiting some of the same vulnerabilities in older versions of Exchange.Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesIncluded in a new federal government report on possible extremist attacks on the Capitol is a warning that information on specific threats has become harder to come by in the wake of the Jan. 6 siege amid a shift toward encrypted communications programs.Why it matters: The finding is likely to put the long-simmering debate over strong encryption back on the front burner.What they're saying: ""Our insight into specific threats is increasingly constrained by the expanding use of secure communications by [domestic violent extremists] following the arrest of individuals involved in the Capitol breach,"" the FBI and Homeland Security Department said in the report, which Axios covered on Wednesday.Between the lines: While it is likely that more extremists are using encrypted communications, law enforcement could have political reasons for playing up the threat, given their longstanding desire to see tech companies forced to include backdoors allowing law enforcement access to encoded messages.The other side: Security experts say backdoors in encryption technologies sooner or later escape the control of law enforcement and end up in the wrong hands, leaving everyone less secure.Photo: Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty ImagesThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security predict violent domestic extremists attacks will increase in 2021, according to a report obtained by Axios.Driving the news: The joint report says extremists have discussed plans to take control of the Capitol and ""remove Democratic lawmakers"" on or about March 4.

113,2 Weeks Later and Samsung’s Austin Foundry is Still Offline,Business,https://www.extremetech.com/computing/320511-samsungs-austin-foundry-is-still-offline-more-than-two-weeks-later,"When Samsung, NXP, and Infineon announced they were shutting down their factories in Austin, TX to help the state manage its electrical shortage, the shutdowns were expected to be brief. There’s no word on whether or not Infineon has restarted, but both Samsung and NXP are still offline, 15 days later.Samsung’s Austin facility accounts for approximately 5 percent of global 300mm wafer production on a monthly basis. The facility focuses on building chips built on Samsung’s 14nm process, with iterations of that node available in the same plant down to 11nm. Power was not restored to the facility until last Saturday, and the company is still busy restoring the facility to proper working order.“I’ve never seen a fab turned on after an outage without hiccups,” industry analyst Pat Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and Strategy, told the Austin American Statesman. “For example, if one molecule of water would find its way into the tools, it could completely halt production. A fab uses very particular gasses, liquids, and matter that is hard to store and put back after it has been brought out of storage.”Image by SamsungProducts built at Samsung’s S2 facility include hardware for Samsung’s LSI (Large Scale Integration) business, including its SSD controllers. Chips for Tesla and Renesas and telecommunication chips for Qualcomm are also manufactured at the facility. A number of Qualcomm RFICs (radio frequency integrated circuits) are built in Austin.“While we are currently making efforts to resume operations as soon as possible, the process may require more time to reach normal levels as we inspect and reconfigure the facility. Our primary focus is to ensure safety on-site for our workforce as well as our community,” Samsung spokeswoman Michele Glaze said.Assuming Samsung doesn’t hit any problems, it sounds like the fab should be back online by this time next week. That would put the full shutdown time at about three weeks. That would correspond to a worldwide 3-5 percent drop in wafer starts in February. That’s not much more than a blip in normal times, but at a time when every facility is under pressure, this is unwelcome news.The good news is that while this will absolutely make the semiconductor shortage worse overall, it shouldn’t necessarily impact supplies of CPUs, GPUs, and other types of hardware we’ve most frequently discussed. Those parts are built by other foundries in other places. It could, however, further impact the automotive market and possibly the SSD market, though Samsung should be reasonably well insulated against that problem. Also, Samsung managed the shutdown in an orderly fashion — it didn’t have to scram the foundry — and has already dispatched a team of engineers to assist with getting it online again.Feature image by Samsung. Now Read:Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

114,Eve is rolling out Thread support to more of its smart home lineup,Hardware,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features,"Filed under:The HomeKit device maker’s big bet this year is on ThreadIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Eve Systems, a maker of smart home products that work with Apple’s HomeKit platform, is announcing an expanded range of devices that support the Thread smart protocol. The news consists of updated versions of its existing smart plug, a forthcoming firmware update for the company’s smart sprinkler, and a new outdoor weather station.Thread is a wireless communication standard that was developed from the ground up for smart home purposes and is designed to replace legacy technologies such as Z-Wave and Zigbee. Benefits of Thread include more reliable connections between devices, faster response times, and longer battery life. Though Thread support has existed in a handful of devices for quite some time, Apple’s HomePod mini is the first one to really make Thread a viable option in the smart home. It can act as a bridge between Thread-enabled accessories and connect them to the internet, which they can’t do on their own. Thread is also one of the pillar technologies of the Connected Home over IP (CHIP) project, a cooperation between all the major smart home platform and device providers to standardize around an interoperable wireless protocol.It’s with that in mind that Eve is updating and expanding its device portfolio. The new Eve Energy, which will be available in either US or UK versions, is an updated version of Eve’s smart plug. It will support both Thread and Bluetooth and will be available in the US starting on April 6th and the UK starting on May 4th. The Energy is unique in that it can act as a repeater for the Thread network, letting it extend the signal to devices even if they are out of reach of a HomePod mini. In the US, the Energy will cost $39.95.A forthcoming firmware update will add Thread support to the $99.95 Eve Aqua, the company’s smart sprinkler system. Thanks to Thread’s greater range, the updated Aqua can maintain its connection to the network better than it could with just Bluetooth. Eve says support for Thread will be released in April.Lastly, the all-new Eve Weather is a wireless outdoor weather station that allows you to track the exact outdoor temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure at your home. It is a replacement for the Eve Degree, a similar product that relied solely on Bluetooth for its connectivity. The Eve Weather has a monochrome display that shows the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions; the Eve app provides access to trends over time and more specific data. The Weather also has Siri integration for voice queries.Eve claims the Weather is IPX3 water resistant and is specifically designed for outdoor use. It runs on a coin cell battery which should last between six and 12 months before needing to be replaced. The Eve Weather will be available starting March 25th for $69.95.These aren’t the only products in Eve’s portfolio that support Thread. The company has already issued firmware updates with Thread support for its door and window sensors and European-spec Energy smart plug, and it says everything it has released since June 2020 has the hardware necessary to work with Thread. It is one of the first companies to really throw its hat into the Thread ring in a meaningful way.Eve is a unique company in the smart home market as its products only work with Apple’s HomeKit platform and don’t support Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or any of the other platforms out there. That’s different from most other smart home companies, which try to reach the broadest possible audience by supporting the most popular platforms, which often means Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The HomeKit device ecosystem is much smaller in comparison, largely thanks to an onerous hardware certification that Apple used to require and has since rolled back. HomeKit is also completely inaccessible from outside of Apple’s ecosystem, so if you have an Android phone, you can’t control Eve devices.Eve Systems CEO Jerome Gackel told me the company’s goal isn’t just to be a HomeKit accessory maker. It’s just that Apple’s platform is the only one that allows Eve to focus its efforts on its devices and apps without having to also maintain a cloud service to allow them to connect to the internet. All of the processing for Eve devices happens locally on your home network or between your own devices, without sending data to the cloud, which helps the company achieve its goal of a privacy-first smart home. (You can still remotely control Eve devices through Apple’s Home app, provided you have a HomeKit hub, such as an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad running in your home.)Gackel hopes that support for Thread and its key role in the CHIP project will open the door to working with the other smart home platforms in the future. But Eve won’t work with Alexa or Google Home so long as they continue to require a cloud connection to their platforms.Eve’s bet on HomeKit has been successful so far — the company already has 18 products in its lineup and claims sales of over 1 million units by 2019, with two-thirds of its customer base in Germany and the rest in the US. Its lineup for 2021 will make it the largest provider of HomeKit accessories, with Thread support being a recurring theme throughout.A newsletter about computers"
115,Donald Trump’s Gab Account Uses an Email Address Belonging to the Extremist Platform’s CEO,Social Media,https://theintercept.com/2021/03/03/gab-donald-trump-email-ceo/,"The Intercept is a First Look Media Company.Gab, the far-right social network that’s known as a safe space for hate speech, QAnon believers, Trump election fraud conspiracists, and white supremacist terrorists, was hacked pretty badly. The site exploded in popularity after the January 6 insurrection when Amazon kicked Parler, another social network used by right-wing extremists, offline, which caused Gab’s user base to explode from about 1 million users to roughly 4 million.The hacker made off with the email addresses and encrypted passwords of all 4 million of the site’s users and the content of more than 39 million posts, including everything posted to 7,632 private groups, and leaked them to the radical transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets. On Monday, DDoSecrets released the nearly 70 gigabytes of hacked data to journalists and researchers. Gab’s CEO Andrew Torba has falsely accused DDoSecrets of hacking Gab — a source provided DDoSecrets with the data, they didn’t hack it themselves — and then used an anti-trans slur when posting about the group.Donald Trump’s Gab account.
Screenshot: The InterceptFormer President Donald Trump’s verified Gab account was among those that were compromised (though the account’s description says it’s “reserved” for Trump, and Torba has stated that Trump himself doesn’t use it). When I got my hands on the Gab data, the first thing I did was look up Trump’s account, and the first thing I noticed was the email address associated with it: [email protected] Why was Trump using this obscure email address, and what is Kuhcoon?It turns out that Torba, the current CEO of Gab, is the former CEO and founder of Kuhcoon (later renamed Automate Ads, and acquired by AdHawk in 2017), a tech startup that offered automated Facebook ad campaigns. According to a 2015 interview, Torba started Kuhcoon in 2011 with his college roommate. The company received venture capital backing from Y Combinator in 2014; in August 2016, Torba stepped down as CEO, and he, along with his co-worker Ekrem Büyükkaya, founded Gab.Since it launched, Gab has been a haven for far-right extremists. Torba’s Gab account was created on August 10, 2016, and the next account created later that day was for the “alt-right” personality Milo Yiannopoulos. Other extremists who created early accounts include anti-feminist conspiracist Mike Cernovich and prominent neo-Nazi Richard Spencer (best known for getting punched in the face at Trump’s inauguration in 2017). The accounts on Gab that have the most followers on the whole platform include unhinged QAnon-sympathizing Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert and personalities like Alex Jones. Half of the 20 most popular Gab groups are devoted to Trump and QAnon.Trump’s account is the only one on Gab that uses an email address from kuhcoon.com. I sent an email to [email protected], but the email bounced.Torba didn’t reply to my email requesting his comment, but he did publicly tweet a response from Gab’s Twitter account, stating, “As per my policy of not communicating with non-Christian and/or communist journos, I will not be replying to this non-story,” and, “It’s not a real email address, therefore it is not checked.”He then mentioned me to make sure I’d see it:Disclosure: I’m on the DDoSecrets advisory board.Update: The story has been updated to make it clear that Torba has been open about the fact that Trump does not use the @realdonaldtrump Gab account.Micah Lee[email protected]​theintercept.com@micahfleeRight-wing lawyer David Abrams’s lawsuit against UCLA could unleash harassment on attendees of a Students for Justice in Palestine event.The program to assist with rent has run into numerous barriers in distributing aid — including landlords.The minimum wage once went up hand in hand with the productivity of the U.S. economy.

SpaceX says it is building a factory in Austin, Texas, to design systems that will help make satellite dishes, Wi-Fi routers, and other equipment for its Starlink satellite broadband network. The news comes from a job posting for an automation and controls engineer position flagged in a story Tuesday by local news channel KXAN.""To keep up with global demand, SpaceX is breaking ground on a new, state of the art manufacturing facility in Austin, TX,"" the job posting said. ""The Automation & Controls Engineer will play a key role as we strive to manufacture millions of consumer facing devices that we ship directly to customers (Starlink dishes, Wi-Fi routers, mounting hardware, etc).""The factory apparently won't make the dishes and routers on site but will instead design systems that improve the manufacturing process. ""Specifically, they will design and develop control systems and software for production line machinery—ultimately tackling the toughest mechanical, software, and electrical challenges that come with high-volume manufacturing, all while maintaining a focus on flexibility, reliability, maintainability, and ease of use,"" the job posting said.Starlink is in beta and is serving over 10,000 customers, and it has asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to deploy up to 5 million user terminals in the US. SpaceX calls this piece of hardware ""Dishy McFlatface,"" and it receives transmissions from SpaceX's low-Earth orbit satellites. See our article about a Dishy McFlatface teardown for more details on the hardware's inner portions, and this article for more pictures of the dish in its fully intact state.Starlink has been charging $99 per month plus a one-time fee of $499 for the user terminal, mounting tripod, and router. Starlink recently began taking preorders for service that would become available in the second half of 2021.The new job posting said the successful applicant will work in Austin but spend up to 25 percent of the time at SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles ""until [the] Austin facility is fully established."" The new engineer will make an impact on Starlink's ability to ship hardware this year. The person will ""set, implement, and maintain schedules and budgets to ensure project completion as we strive to ship to 25+ countries by the end of the year,"" the job posting said.The engineer will be expected to ""design, develop, and manage automation and controls projects to manufacture consumer electronics that are easy for humans around the world to use, but are technically very sophisticated—this includes initial factory ideation, on-line commissioning and proof of rate capability, and eventual hand-off to operational teams."" The engineer will also ""spearhead facility bring up and initial equipment conceptual development by carefully balancing product specifications, process requirements, layout complexity, cost, and lead-time limits,"" the job posting said.We asked SpaceX for more detail on plans for the Austin facility and when it will open, and on where exactly the dishes and routers will be manufactured. We'll update this article if we get an answer.The new SpaceX factory would be near Tesla's planned car factory in Austin.

118,UK starts probe on Apple over alleged App Store monopoly,Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-probe-britain/uk-starts-probe-on-apple-over-alleged-app-store-monopoly-idUSKBN2AW12S?il=0,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Reuters Staff2 Min Read(Reuters) - Britain’s competition regulator said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into Apple Inc after complaints that the iPhone maker’s terms and conditions for app developers are unfair and anti-competition.The probe will consider if Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.Payment policies related to Apple’s App Store have for long drawn complaints from app developers as it requires them to use its payment system, which charges commissions of between 15% and 30%.The company has also been at loggerheads with Epic Games, the creator of popular game Fortnite, which last year tried to avoid the 30% fee by launching its own in-app payment system, leading to Apple banning Fortnite from its store.The iPhone maker said on Thursday it will work with the regulator.“The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place — applied fairly and equally to all developers — to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent,” Apple said in a statement.The company is also being investigated on similar grounds by the Dutch competition authorities, who are nearing a draft decision, Reuters reported last month.Last year, the European Commission too had opened a probe into the iPhone maker over App Store commission fee.“Complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice – potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps – warrant careful scrutiny,” CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.Reporting by Muvija M and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru, Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Arun KoyyurOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

119,Why Google's approach to replacing the cookie is drawing antitrust scrutiny,Business,https://digiday.com/media/why-googles-approach-to-replacing-the-cookie-is-drawing-antitrust-scrutiny/,"Google’s decision to kill off third-party cookies has already elicited multiple antitrust lawsuits and a U.S. congressional probe. Now, its attempt to replace the cookie is attracting regulatory attention.On Jan. 8, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into whether Google’s proposals for replacing third-party cookies — through an effort Google has branded Privacy Sandbox — “could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,” according to a CMA announcement about the investigation.Under pressure from governments and consumers over data privacy infringement concerns, Google a year ago said it will disable third-party cookies by 2022 in its Chrome browser, which is used by more than 60% of the world’s web users. The move will effectively disable a primary way that ads are targeted and content is personalized on publishers’ sites. By extension, it could compromise publishers’ abilities to make money from online advertising and push people, their data and — along with them — ad dollars further within the walls of Google’s already dominant properties, according to ad tech and publishing executives.Google’s decision to disable the third-party cookie has been referenced as examples of anti-competitive behavior in recent antitrust suits against the company, too. A multi-state antitrust suit filed in December claimed Google uses its “massive information advantage strategically to harm any publisher who refuses to use its intermediaries.” Another recent antitrust suit filed on behalf of publishers claimed that Google’s cookie decision was “exclusionary.” Federal lawmakers also highlighted antitrust concerns over Google’s third-party cookie plans in a 2020 report from the U.S. House Subcommittee on Antitrust.Through its Privacy Sandbox initiative, Google has proposed an evolving collection of ad targeting and measurement methods for replacing third-party cookies. The sandbox project is open to participation from other ad tech firms who can join in through an online forum, the Worldwide Web Consortium. However, ad tech providers and publishers are wary of how open Google actually is to their participation.“Privacy Sandbox is trying to replace an open and interoperable technology with one that is Google controlled,” wrote James Rosewell, director of Marketers for an Open Web a group whose complaints against Google helped prompt the CMA investigation. “This will force more marketers into their walled garden and will spell the end of the independent and Open Web.” Rosewell is CEO of 51 Degrees, a mobile ad and publishing tech firm.Critics question Google’s commitment to a collaborative cookie replacement processDespite the seemingly collaborative setting, Google’s Privacy Sandbox is under increasing scrutiny throughout the digital media industry and now from the U.K. government because Privacy Sandbox is under Google’s control.“Google has magnanimously allowed the industry to play a role,” said Alan Chapell, president of privacy law firm Chapell and Associates, with some sarcasm. “Google should not be allowed to call this an industry consensus project.”A Google executive defended the firm in light of the CMA investigation. “The Privacy Sandbox has been an open initiative since the beginning and we welcome the CMA’s involvement as we work to develop new proposals to underpin a healthy, ad-supported web without third-party cookies,” said Chetna Bindra, group product manager, user trust and privacy at Google, in a statement.In regards to the Privacy Sandbox investigation, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the U.K.’s CMA said in a statement last month the agency “has an open mind and has not reached any conclusions at this stage as to whether or not competition law has been infringed.” He also said that the agency “will continue to engage with Google and other market participants to ensure that both privacy and competition concerns can be addressed as the proposals are developed.”Google’s approach could favor its browser business, say criticsAd tech firms are participating in the Google sandbox effort. But some, including Criteo, are leery of an approach they say has been too centered around the browser.“Chrome’s proposals remain very much browser-centric, which Criteo has shared in the past our concerns about,” Arnaud Blanchard, senior analytics and product manager at Criteo, told Digiday.If parts of the ad operation happen inside the device at the browser level, the data storage and processing demands will be too burdensome and possibly even discriminatory against people with limited data plans, Blanchard said.One of Criteo’s proposals to provide more balance in the cookieless targeting and measurement process is to set up an “independent gatekeeper” such as a cloud service provider or SSP to “provide people more control and transparency,” said Blanchard.In response to concerns around browser-centric control, Google recently unveiled its latest targeting method, FLEDGE, which incorporates what it calls a “trusted server” that stores information about an ad campaign’s bids and budgets.When asked what qualities determine whether a server is trustworthy, and whether Google or some other entity would control such a trusted server, Bindra told Digiday those issues would be determined through public forum discussions with those participating in development of Privacy Sandbox ad methods. “FLEDGE does not specify or expect any particular entity to run a ‘trusted server,'” she said.An issue of trustTrust in Google — or lack thereof — is at the core of most complaints about the Privacy Sandbox process. At the end of the day, said Chapell, people need to trust that Chrome will do what’s best for users, that Google’s numbers are accurate, that Google will itself employ the approach it is devising for the open web and that other ad tech firms have a genuine ability to compete once it is in place.Any method that could give Google even more control over the ad process has advertisers, publishers and ad tech firms raising eyebrows.“It certainly would be a step in the right direction if it were an independent entity,” said Chapell. “Anybody but Google is a step in the right direction.”Bloomberg is testing a virtual events model where attendees could pay different amounts to attend with a slew of tracks.The Week created and grew a children's publication in the unprecedented pandemic year to keep young audiences engaged.Some identifiers just won’t work in some Google inventory, but identity tech providers are keeping a stiff upper lip.Marketing teams are now well into 2021, and third-party cookies along with mobile ad IDs are officially on notice, which has implications for all marketers. Soon, cookie- and device-based targeting, frequency capping, measurement and attribution will break. Evolving privacy regulations and policy changes from browsers and device makers have sparked many proposed solutions to replace […]Media companies’ diversity shortcomings pervade their organizations, but lack of diversity among their executive and management ranks is particularly problematic.

120,Brave acquires Tailcat search engine; will offer search results without profiling users,Business,https://www.ghacks.net/2021/03/04/brave-acquires-tailcat-search-engine-will-offer-search-results-without-profiling-users/,"ADVERTISEMENTBrave Software has acquired the Tailcat search engine, to step up the competition with Google Search. Tailcat will be integrated in to Brave Browser, as Brave Search.Brave Search is intended to be an alternative for Google Search, while being a privacy-focused service that does not collect IP addresses or personal information, and won't track users.So, this sounds similar to DuckDuckGo. But there are quite a few differences.Brave says that Search will serve the user first, in other words it is not devoid of ads. Instead of tracking users with personalized ads, Brave Search will employ non-targeted ads. If you're familiar with the Brave Browser, you may have noticed how the user ads work. The browser displays random sponsored ads (non-personalized, ad campaigns) which when viewed earns you some BATs (Basic Attention Tokens. Brave says it is working on private ads which will be delivered via search. There are plans to offer Brave Rewards with Search, so this could be another way to earn more BATs.There will be two tiers in Brave Search; an ad-free premium search, while the other will be an ad-supported search as described above. Brave claims that it will provide unbiased search results without forced censorship or biased algorithms, unlike other services which have been criticized and have often been hit by lawsuits, for promoting specific results.Tailcat is a search engine that was developed by Cliqz. You may have heard of the Cliqz browser, it was a fork of Mozilla Firefox, and was focused on privacy and included a custom search engine. Mozilla invested in Cliqz back in 2016, but a year later Cliqz (the company behind it) acquired the popular privacy-focused extension, Ghostery. Four years later, in 2020, Cliqz was shut down. The browser's built-in search engine was the first to display search suggestions and top search results as the search query was being typed in the address bar. The important part here is that the search engine delivered results, while protecting the privacy of the user.You may know this already, but DuckDuckGo's search suggestions (Autosuggest) are powered by Microsoft's Bing, Yahoo, etc. In fact, it has hundreds of sources. Tailcat on the other hand is an independent search engine, i.e., it doesn't rely on Bing, Google, etc, it has its own index. This is just an educated guess, but these are likely the features that made Brave Software want to acquire Tailcat.Brave Search isn't available for users yet, you can join the waitlist by visiting https://brave.com/search/.You will have the option to choose the search engine of your choice in Brave Browser, that's not surprising as anti-trust laws practically guarantee that users have multiple options. But more interestingly, the announcement says Brave Search will be available on other browsers as well. So, we could use it in Firefox, Vivaldi, Chrome, Edge, etc.Brave says that it has over 25 million monthly active users in 2021, and likened its growth to the recent exodus from Whatsapp to Signal, after the Facebook-owned service shot itself in the foot by making questionable changes to its privacy policy.I'm not a fan of Ghostery or Brave for that matter (though I'm intrigued by its recent developments), is it a browser that also happens to have a cryptocurrency associated with it? Or is it the other way around? Regardless of that, having an unbiased, independent, open ranking alternative to a dominant Big Tech based service does sound good on paper, but only time will tell how Brave Search turns out to be.Will this section surpass 200 comments in the first day? 0_0@ShintoPlasmDepends on the amount of FUD and misinformation spread, I guess. One comment already started with it.Haha!@ ShintoPlasm> Will this section surpass 200 comments in the first day? 0_0It could be even more when the “Hate Mob” and the defenders of the one true browser really start posting. :))))))Ahh yes, the mythical “internet mob” … their manifesto clearly outlines hate for potatoes such as Iron Heart> potatoes such as Iron Heart…are still informed enough to refute your nonsense with ease.> There will be two tiers in Brave Search; an ad-free premium searchAdvertising platform Brave acquires search engine, to offer ad-free version for MONEY. For those who do not pay (the majority), adverts will be shown which nets Brave Search more MONEY. And those who use BATSHITS, create even more MONEY for Brave by allowing them to hijack the ads and extort even more.Brave is an advertising platform first and foremost, not a browser. It’s just chromium with gimmicks – an adblocker so they can detect ads to hijack for extortion, allows large amounts of whitelisting in trackers of the biggest players, adds a useless Tor mode that defeats anonymity as it is highly fingerprintable, sticks adverts in your start page, steals your telemetry including Tor usage (WTF), took money on behalf of content creators who knew nothing about it, promotes it’s own BATSHIT in web content via injection (WTF!), comes with a sickening gradient orange-pink color scheme that puts amateurs to shame, and any gullible person wanting their BATSHITS has to give up their privacy.And never forget just how low they will go: deliberately planned and engineered for scaling, to hijack typed urls in the urlbar which no other browser has even done.There is more, but for fucks sake, this is an advertising company. It is funded by venture capitalists. The users are the product.Brave does not care about privacy: it is being hijacked, like everything else they do, as a marketing gimmick to suck in non-technical users (like Iron Heart).>> Brave is an advertising platform first and foremost, not a browser.Pretty much sums it up.Brave is an advertising company. Their sole purpose is to hold content creators hostage by hijacking their ads to extort money as a ticket-clipping useless middleman. They must be salivating at the mouth at google’s FLoC as yet another means to monetize their usershttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea“Brave is an advertising company”https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/06/06/the-brave-web-browser-is-hijacking-links-and-inserting-affiliate-codes/Brendan Eich, the founder and CEO of Brave, assures us that putting his referrer links into URLs that users typed in, to try to get people to click through accidentally, is all completely upright and above-board – source: https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1269289242905042944No other browser has ever HIJACKED TYPED URLSThen Eich is very sorry that Brave got caught again… says it is a now a mistakeMistake? Bull shit: scaled for even more monetizing and hijacking or typed urls – https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/master/components/omnibox/browser/suggested_sites_provider_data.ccAlso, Brave was caught in December 2018 asking for donations on behalf of other people without telling them https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2019/01/13/brave-web-browser-no-longer-claims-to-fundraise-on-behalf-of-others-so-thats-nice/Anything for money because they are a for-profit advertising platform@Hi_JackI debunked this in my reply to the main hate comment directed at Brave, no need to repeat the lies and misinformation spread here.> No other browser has ever HIJACKED TYPED URLSOther browsers add their own referrals to search queries:“The Mozilla Corporation’s relationship with Google has been noted in the popular press, especially with regard to their paid referral agreement.”source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation#GoogleThere’s no fundamental difference here, search websites are the same as any other website. And “hijacked”… Brave and Binance are officially partners for all to see, you frame this like this was totally unknown, which it was not. It was never a privacy issue for users, contrary to this shit, when Firefox got hijacked with spyware crap by Mozilla:https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/756s0f/an_index_of_discussions_about_the_cliqz/When proven hypocrites here talk about “hijacking”, I rarely see this very real issue being brought up, why is that? Hm… I wonder.> Other browsers add their own referrals to search queries:search queries are NOT typed urls.

Did you know that any search query generates a related URL after you press enter? Ever looked at the URL bar at the search results page?> Stop being a dick and man up to the fact that Brave does shitty things.I think you should man up to the fact that there is zero technical difference here and that you are thus a hypocrite.> WTF does cliqz have to do with Brave HIJACKING urlsFirefox got hijacked with spyware that exfiltrated visited websites and website interaction data from users, while Brave was using a referral on Binance just like Firefox does with Google, the referral being totally unrelated to user privacy in both cases. You ignore the former and ride the latter to death = hypocrisy.> sorry i mean thief imposter, for unsuspecting content creatorsNothing was “stolen”, it was a simple bug (that has long been resolved, btw) and all monetary matters were cleared up to everyone’s satisfaction. Again, grow up.> Did you know that any search query…search queries are NOT typed urls. No other browser has ever HIJACKED typed urls… only Brave, because users do not matter, only money matters> just like Firefox does with GoogleBULLSHIT. type google.com into the urlbar in Firefox and hit enter.

You are deluded beyond help.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26331756 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26333446How much does Eich pay you for this crap? You own Brave dude who worked at Cliqz says “Mozilla never did such a thing. The browsing history was never sent in any shape or form”.@pirate_pete> search queries are NOT typed urlsURLs are URLs, there are no “typed URLs” as a different class of URLs, a trumped up difference of input is no technical difference at all.> because users do not matter, only money mattersThe damage for users was… what exactly? It’s not privacy for sure.You help Mozilla get money from their overlords by using Google (count per search), Brave users help Brave get money from Binance (count per visit), no fundamental difference here. Only in your mind.> BULLSHIT.HYPOCRISY.> BULLSHIT. You are deluded beyond help.I am referring to this incident:https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/756s0f/an_index_of_discussions_about_the_cliqz/It rather seems like you are deluded, or what is more likely, a huge hypocrite.Never forget just how low Brave will go to make money out of its usershttps://cryptobriefing.com/privacy-enhancing-brave-browser-may-not-be-private-after-all/https://cryptobriefing.com/basic-attention-token-rebounds-despite-brave-autofill-controversy/Brave will always violate users first, apologize if caught, claim it was a mistake, point elsewhere@no_nameBoth articles claim that the referral was a privacy issue, which is objectively nonsense misinformation. A static referral used by all users cannot(!) be a privacy issue because tracking of specific users based on that is impossible. The referral was not dynamically generated for specific users.> Brave will always violate users firstIn what way? Contrary to the sensationalist articles filled with misinformation that you just posted here, it is clearly not a privacy issue, so user privacy was left intact. Neither were users paying Brave, Brave’s partners are paying Brave based on visit count. The same happens when you do a Google Search in FF, Firefox gets money from Google based on the number of searches it generates, and for this purpose Firefox attaches a referral to all search URLs in the same manner like Brave attached a referral to the Binance URL. Do you feel “violated” by Firefox as well?I mean, I understand that some people here are out to damage the Brave project at all costs, but the lows you sink to in the process are rather sad. Misinformation has no place here.@AnonymousWow, this comment is filled wit hate for Brave, I doubt that there is much of a point in reacting to you, but anyways, doing it to clarify some things for others:> Brave is an advertising platform first and foremost, not a browser.It’s literally a browser with a purely opt-in advertising system.> It’s just chromium with gimmicks – an adblocker so they can detect ads to hijack for extortion,It is one of the first Chromium browsers trying to seriously tackle the issue of fingerprinting, it has a very performant adblocker which will survive Manifest V3 as it’s natively implemented, it’s the only Chromium-based browser that can defend against CNAME uncloaking, it is thoroughly ungoogled (which in itself is a worth), has the most privacy-respecting sync out of all browsers etc.But hey, let’s reduce it to just “Chromium + adblocker”, the world can be so simple at times. Also, “extortion”… You deprive websites of their income by using ANY adblocker, be it uBlock origin, be it AdBlock Plus, or be it the internal Brave adblocker. The income is gone no matter what you opt for here. Now, what Brave does is to introduce a different kind of ad system in which user privacy is respected and in which users can earn a share of the revenue, which is a plus for users (who are left out of the equation in the current system). Users may choose to distribute BAT to their favorite content creators, and these content creators can claim the BAT completely FOR FREE. Brave users also can’t donate to people who aren’t registered content creators, so there is no amount of BAT “lingering” somewhere unclaimed here. When you refuse to become part of this much fairer system for whatever reason, users using Brave on your website are no different than those using uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus etc., which you should equally shun if you were intellectually honest. At least, Brave gives you the option to still get your share while NOT leaving users out in the cold monetarily.> allows large amounts of whitelisting in trackers of the biggest playersFake news. Here is a factual explanation:https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/12/privacy-browser-braves-user-concern-over-facebook-whitelist/They had to whitelist select Twitter and Facebook libraries because otherwise those websites were BROKEN BY DEFAULT for users, which, as you might agree, is not fantastic for a new browser project meaning to grow. This was purely for unbreaking websites, and if you insist on breaking them (perhaps because you don’t use them – just be aware that this is not the case for everyone), you can break them via the settings under brave://settings/socialBlocking …Brave is blocking as many social media trackers as possible, whitelisting select libraries to reduce breakage(!) does not mean that they whitelisted Facebook and Twitter trackers globally! This is nonsense! Oh and by the way, the internal tracking protection of Firefox, or uBlock Origin, or AdBlock Plus, DON’T BLOCK THESE EITHER for much the same reason – to avoid said breakage. Criticizing Brave for not blocking something that isn’t blocked by anyone else (for good reason) is idiotic.> adds a useless Tor mode that defeats anonymity as it is highly fingerprintableBrave cannot have Tor’s exact fingerprint because it is frankly impossible without being based on Firefox (which is what Tor uses currently). They can’t change that, and they explicitly say that you should use the Tor Browser if you need Tor’s anonymity in some high risk situation. Brave’s Tor windows are a gimmick feature meant to hide your IP address, in a browser that is otherwise much of an everyday browsing tool.> sticks adverts in your start page???Do you mean Sponsored New Tab Page? It’s not a privacy issue, the New Tab Page is being cached locally. If one doesn’t like it, one can turn it off very easily right on that New Tab Page.> steals your telemetry including Tor usage (WTF)To be clear, they do not collect WHAT you do in Tor windows, just THAT you use them. This says nothing about your actions in them. Compared to other browsers, Brave’s telemetry is rather mild and can be turned off under brave://settings/privacy … And that actually turns it off, there is no hidden telemetry that is being kept enabled (*cough* Firefox *cough*).> took money on behalf of content creators who knew nothing about itThere was a bug that allowed donating to websites that were not registered content creators. The bug has long been resolved, and the matter was cleared up. When you implement a system as Brave Rewards, bugs happen, just accept that. There was no harm induced here.> promotes it’s own BATSHIT in web content via injection (WTF!)Brave Ads are system notifications.> comes with a sickening gradient orange-pink color scheme that puts amateurs to shameMatter of taste and only in the settings AFAIK. Good god, your post is overflowing with hatred. The colors in the settings? Seriously?> and any gullible person wanting their BATSHITS has to give up their privacyBrave has to comply with legal requirements – Uphold (their partner) offers bank accounts, and you need to identify yourself when you want to create one. Sorry to say. Nothing that can be done about that unless laws change, you blame them for something here that is outside of their responsibility to decide.> deliberately planned and engineered for scaling, to hijack typed urls in the urlbar which no other browser has even done.Uh, you are very creative, that literally never came up before:https://www.ghacks.net/2020/12/25/how-to-hide-the-tips-icons-that-brave-places-on-some-sites-automatically-as-part-of-its-rewards-system/#comment-4481424I guess you also screech in pain when literally every browser adds its own referral whenever you perform a web search, or is that kind of criticism hypocritically only limited to Brave?Anyways, whatever one may think of it and the associated practice taking place in all browsers, it was never a privacy issue for users, but rather a question of how a small browser vendor is supposed to fund itself without selling user data. Moving on…> There is more * [Editor: removed]> It is funded by venture capitalists.Do you know who funds other major browsers?> The users are the product.Can’t say this in all seriousness considering that:– Brave Rewards are 100% opt-in, disabled by default. – Brave Rewards are privacy-respecting. – Brave Rewards are the first advertising system where users can earn their fair share IF they opt-in.It’s pretty embarrassing how you get all worked up over something that’s disabled by default, and that you think it is a good idea to verbally bring down a new advertising system that no longer violates user privacy and no longer deprives them of their fair share.> it is being hijackedThe only browser companies that ever “hijacked” their users, causing actual harm, were Mozilla (Cliqz and Mr. Robot incidents) and Google (proprietary binary blob download incident).> non-technical users (like Iron Heart).You say this after having published unsubstantiated * [Editor: removed] which I had to debunk (Thank you for a wasted morning, by the way), but evidently you know much better than me.Well said Iron Heart.You are such a * [Editor: removed, please stay polite]. I mean it’s smart marketing since you know most here are the guys that people come to to ask about tech and if you convince us bRaVe is good we would’ve told others. No thanks.@SorrynoI don’t want to convince anyone of anything here. I am just fighting deliberately touted misinformation.Jesus Christ mate, does Eichtard Eich personally pay you 0.00376 shitecoin per paragraph or something?@Brass EyeThe length of my reply is determined by the amount of misinformation spread. And there was a lot of it in that post, so a simple one liner is not enough to refute it, you see.This coming from a guy who has hundreds of hateful comments about Firefox.You come across as a very angry spiteful person.Your obsession with defending Brave is not normal.Anyway it’s good to have more search engines who don’t watch you like a hawk.@TonyMy reply here was neither angry nor spiteful, although both would be warranted by the amount of misinformation laid out here, which I admit makes me angry.> hateful comments about FirefoxThe Firefox community here is no better, wait and see how much hatred Brave will be receiving in this comment section going forward.And honestly, considering how they treat their users, claiming to provide privacy while hijacking the browser and offering anything but privacy by default, considering how they want to make the browser the arbiter of what I can see or not se on the Internet, and considering that they call decentralized structures aimed at freeing users from corporate surveillance “the decentralized web of hate” (just because some idiots misuse them, it automatically makes it a bad idea to get away from big brother… oh wait), I think they are not getting *enough* criticism (otherwise called “hate” by some people around here).@ Iron Heart You brainwashed yourself so much you don’t know what’s left or right any longer.You defend a Browser with ads like a crazy man,and try to tell everyone it’s more private than browsers like Firefox.And no it doesn’t matter if you can turn the ads off.A browser who has ads is never a privacy first browser.And that’s only one of the reasons one shouldn’t use Brave.I’m glad that someone can actually answer back with technical knowledge based on sources on a tech forum instead of spewing random stuff.Well written Iron Heart.“as a marketing gimmick to suck in non-technical users (like Iron Heart).”He understands perfectly how Brave works, so it’s worse that he defends this system. Maybe paid for that, maybe for free because he thinks that it furthers the glory of the “America first” party.Like many who insult Iron Heart here understand perfectly how Mozilla Pocket or Cliqz that they support work, so that their criticism of the similar Brave problem often intentionally misses the main target to focus on side issues. Maybe they’re paid for that, maybe for free because they think it furthers the glory of the “America is back” party.@Anonymous> He understands perfectly how Brave works, so it’s worse that he defends this system. Maybe paid for that, maybe for free because he thinks that it furthers the glory of the “America first” party.Oh please… I’m not even American (there are more countries in the world, you know), and while my bank account could always make use of more money, I have not received any paycheck from Brave Software yet (lol). Anyhow, you fail to see the easiest explanation: That I find it necessary to debunk misinformation. It is what it is.>>> You may have heard of the Cliqz browserIron Heart said on February 26, 2021 at 2:32 pmHonestly: If those non-issues are all you’ve got, it only shows that the Brave project is fairly legit. Firefox had actual scandals that caused harm (e.g. hijacking new installations with the Cliqz spyware, via the FF experiments backdoor), but I don’t see anyone talking about that, and this just screams HYPOCRITE.Yes, the Cliqz system add-on was definitely spyware:https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-tests-cliqz-engine-which-slurps-user-browsing-data/Cliqz is also the company that acquired the shady extension Ghostery (which was known for selling user data to advertisers), and Cliqz is is partially owned by none other than Mozilla(!).When Brave Software acquires a search engine developed by Cliqz, then this should be held under scrutiny, however, all will depend on 1) whether the code is open source or not and 2) whether or not any problematic component that might(!) be there is being removed by Brave Software. So I think the jury on this one is still out, but yes, I do not trust Cliqz and as such any action like this deserves to be monitored closely. It’s also clear from the get go that I won’t ever use this search engine (I use DuckDuckGo and Searx), and I don’t believe that Brave will enforce its use in the browser itself (maybe make it the default, but nothing beyond that).Iron Heart lying about Cliqz for the 1 billionth timeHere is “solso” who worked for Cliqz and now works for Brave. Never trust Iron Heart, he does zero research and posts shitehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26331756 > There was no tracking on Cliqz, nor it will be any in Brave. To know more about the underlying tech of Cliqz there are interesting posts at https://0x65.dev, some of them covering how signals are collected, data, but no tracking. I did work at Cliqz and now I work at Brave. I can tell for a fact, that all data was, is and will be, record-unlinkable. That means that no-one, not me, not the government, not the ad department can reconstruct a session with your activity. Again, there is no tracking, full anonymity, Brave would not do it any other way.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26333446 > Mozilla never did such a thing. The browsing history was never sent in any shape or form. As the journalistic article you quote states, Mozilla put in place the HumanWeb[1,2,3], which was a privacy preserving data collection which ensured record-unlinkability, hence no session or history. Anonymity was guaranteed and the framework was extensively tested by privacy researchers from both Cliqz and Mozilla.

You can’t. The fact is that it was collected(!) which is the only thing of interest to me – anonymization is outside of my control and I’d have to trust the company that owns a product that has sold user data (Ghostery), which is a bit much to ask for.And I think collecting browsing data and website interaction data from users secretly, without their consent, is a) totally unnecessary and b) unethical even if they had anonymized the data sets, which I am personally not convinced of. Users were never asked for their consent (GDPR?), this data collection doesn’t need to happen, and anonymization can’t be proven aside from pledges.Nobody asks whether something like that *needs* to happen and *why*. Nobody cares about informed *user consent*, and this is SAD.Also, funnily enough, when I am voicing skepticism regarding Brave’s most recent acquisition, i.e. not defending them because of said skepticism, as I did here, then you somehow still manage to portray me as the villain. Quite amazing, to be honest.When data collection is legitimate, making it unlinkable can be a privacy benefit.However when it is not legitimate to begin with, like for advertisers or without user consent, making it unlikable won’t change the problem that it is privacy hostile. I even disagree that such unwelcome data collection should no longer be called “tracking” at all just because it is unlikable or anonymous, it is another vocabulary swindle to legitimate such attacks against privacy.That sort of manipulation is used very often by tracking companies, starting with Google. Don’t fall for it.@Anonymous – with the links to “solso” I’ve not been aware of that side of story. The idea of EU digital infrastructure as a counterweight to US-capitalists tickles me where it should. Qestions: – would Brave carry on that idea? Personally I doubt. Not due to evil motives, just money. – what search engines would you guys reccomend that are not google/bing backed, made in eu, that at least declaratevily are “privacy oriented”, unbiased?@Iron HeartHave you tried eTools? https://www.etools.ch/searchInfo.do I’ve been using it for about a year and a half (after StartPage was bought by some shady guys) and really like it.I don’t trust DDG )“In researching the background DuckDuckGo, I uncovered some interesting history.

He then sold Names Database (and all the user data) to Classmates.com for “approximately $10 million in cash” in March 2006.DuckDuckGo was launched a few years later, in 2008 and was branded as a privacy search engine.” https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/Iron Heart said on March 4, 2021 at 10:52 am >>> and Cliqz is is partially owned by none other than Mozilla(!)… so to speak: evil Mozilla owns part of Brave.

Hubert Burda Media is also not owned by Mozilla.Do you remember this comment?https://www.ghacks.net/2021/02/10/another-glimpse-at-firefoxs-upcoming-proton-design-refresh-the-new-menu/#comment-4485910Cliqz was “majority-owned by Hubert Burda Media” and “The deal, terms undisclosed, makes Cliqz owner Hubert Burda Media a Brave shareholder.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqzhttps://www.theregister.com/2021/03/03/brave_buys_a_search_engine/> makes Cliqz owner Hubert Burda Media a Brave shareholder.”That is reason for skepticism, as I said.>>> The deal, terms undisclosed,Oh, that’s by DEFAULT ;~) … or IOW your “more Privacy-by-Default” future.>>> Hubert Burda Media a Brave shareholderThat which belongs together, grows together.Enjoy your batty shitecoins and tracking sheeple@Anonymous> Enjoy your batty shitecoins and tracking sheepleProof that Brave is collecting user data? Or are you just talking out of your ass, like so many others here?And yeah, Brave users can get paid while browsing, while you, mate, earn nothing. Definitely a disadvantage of Brave, lol.Iron Heart said “Brave users can get paid while browsing”Not without giving up their privacy. Iron Heart logic at it’s best.@Anonymous“Iron Heart logic” is still intact, neither Uphold nor Brave ever receive your browsing history at any point.Ess et am räne?. Thank you for the link to Iron Heart’s post.However, if you search the Internet, the following information is revealed:Mozilla announced that it would offer Cliqz as an experimental ADDON for Firefox. Read the press release in the link below: The ADDON was only released for use in Germany where Cliqz was based.https://blog.mozilla.org/press-uk/2017/10/06/testing-cliqz-in-firefox/Martin Brinkmann posted the following explaining the experiment:https://www.ghacks.net/2017/10/06/mozilla-to-launch-firefox-cliqz-experiment-with-data-collecting/IF a user checked the FF addons and found Cliqz, it was a simple matter to remove Cliqz with a single Click.Furthermore, by using about:config, it was (and is) very easy to block Mozilla experiments.By setting the value to false in about:config for the following preferences, Mozilla experiments are blocked. So it was not a Mozilla backdoor. Mozilla is very upfront about its use of experiments.network.allow-experiments experiments.enabled experiments.activeExperimentFinally, on April 29, 2020, Cliqz was closed down and disappeared.I hope that this clarifies the issue regarding the Firefox SCANDAL@Tom McThe problem is that FF has a backdoor enabled by default which they can use for “experiments”, and this can get abused for stuff like Cliqz.I am not saying that it can’t be disabled by digging into the config, but you should realize that this is not how most people use Firefox, nor does it justify any abuse of user trust.@ Iron HeartPlease post the links to the sources which explain how the Firefox default backdoor is implemented.@Tom Mchttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Normandy/PreferenceRollouthttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Shield/Shield_StudiesMozilla can remote-install and execute any code they wish without having to use the browser’s regular update functionality. That’s hijacking in my book.At its worst, this could be the result:https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/756s0f/an_index_of_discussions_about_the_cliqz/Mozilla isn’t exactly a foreigner to user data theft.> I am not saying that it can’t be disabled by digging into the configExperiments and 99.99% of all telemetry can be disabled with a single checkbox in preferences.

Doesn’t come close to Firefox@pirate_peteyIs that why Firefox is doing so well as of late?“Is that why Firefox is doing so well as of late?”It’s doing awesome. Steady at 220 million users for about a yearI fail to see how market share is a quantity that indicates quality. Your logic is fubar man, like most of your knowledge@pirate pete> It’s doing awesome.http://calpaterson.com/mozilla.htmlIs Brave doing better? Riding the crypto wave and still standing behind Firefox in every metric! Woohooooooooooo!!!@”Iron C.”Secondly, Firefox is 17 years old, Brave is 4 years old. Firefox gained its users in the quality vacuum left by IE, i.e. it only had to be better than the most shitty browser on earth to do well, Brave has gained a significant numbers of users in a saturated market where its competitors are actually competent. Apples and oranges at its finest.And yet, Brave grows exponentially, having reached 25 million monthly active users ex nihilo, in 4 years time, in a market situation that is highly competitive. Firefox usage has been going down for at least a decade now.Keep pretending that those are not the facts, it’s OK.Brave is not a browser developer. They do not build the engine. They don’t even test their own work. Canvas randomizing still leaks. Tor window leaked. Wonder what else is shit. Eich is always apologizing for mistakes. Maybe he should hire Iron Heart as his super apology spreaderBrave is gifted a browser by their masters google and hardly have to do a thing. All Brave does is add a few wonky shitty patches on top and then go lie to everyone about how much they care about privacy. In four years they have done fuck all. Some adbocking that whitelists the internet’s biggest trackers, BATSHIT crypto to rip everyone off, code to inject BAT adverts into web content, and some fingerprinting which is almost useless, nothing like Tor Browser or privacy.resistFingerprinting.It’s not hard to go from nothing to a rounding error greater than zero: 25 million is a rounding error in a world of over 7 billion devices“Brave says that Search will serve the user first, in other words it is not devoid of ads.”They even write that : “User-first Brave serves the users first, not the advertising and data industries.” https://brave.com/search/Showing ads, furthermore targeted from private data and tipping the advertisers about the efficiency of the ads, is “serving the user first, not the advertising and data industry” ?No, it’s making the user the product to serve Brave and other members of the advertising and private data raping industry. Everybody outside of Brave understands “user-first” as implying “no ads”. There is a myriad of actual “user-first” services and software that are ethical alternatives to those shady businesses. But Brave can’t just live happily with being an ad company, it’s not wrong enough, they need to convince everybody that being an ad company is “user-first”.“Private We aren’t in the business of harvesting your data. We don’t want it!”Deceptive, the problem is not as much “harvesting” data (smart wording) as “processing it for bad purposes”, no matter if it happens on a targeted ad supported search server that may not store queries or in a local malicious browser. In that sense, sure they harvest lots of private data and want that data a lot, that’s how they make money, from misusing that private data.“We will offer best in class integration between browser and search, from personalization without compromising privacy to instant results as you type.”Does this mean that search results will be personalized from what the user does on the browser ? If so another attack against privacy. The likely implied keylogger in the address bar is nothing new however.For the rest, I’ll wait for a Tailcat privacy policy.———– “The browser displays random sponsored ads (non-personalized, ad campaigns)”Browser ads are “random”, “non-personalized” ? No, Brave’s principle is to process an amount of private data rarely reached elsewhere to match ads to the user, by taping in the centralized private data source directly, the browser itself, instead of having to add together unreliable pieces of private data collected from tracking servers that could be blocked by pesky tracker blockers.“Brave Ads are matched to you” https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026361072-Brave-Ads-FAQ“Brave uses local machine learning with the browser profile to only place ads in optimal conditions.” https://brave.com/brave-ads/“How are ads targeted based on browser-side intent signals? As mentioned above, the browser knows almost everything you do. It knows what sites you visit, how much time you spend on them, what you look at, what is visible “above the fold” and not occluded by opaque layers, what searches you make, what groups of tabs you open while researching major purchases, etc. Only the browser, after HTTPS terminates and secure pages are decrypted, has all of your private data needed to analyze user intent.” https://brave.com/faq/#ads-targeted“For behavior targeting, our approach uses an in-browser agent that studies all the valuable data feeds in every browser: navigation, search queries, ecommerce form filling and submitting, page views and visibility known in fraud-free terms by the browser’s rendering engine. All of these feeds inform the agent so it can pick the best user ad” https://streetfightmag.com/2020/01/08/brave-ceo-brendan-eich-on-a-privacy-by-default-future-for-digital-advertising/Not having the full actual private data on a distant server does not matter as long as they can process it as they wish against the user with local malicious code. It’s even part of Google’s “privacy sandbox” ideas. Another famous “user-first, fighting the advertising and data industry” company.———– “Cliqz browser, it was a fork of Mozilla Firefox, and was focused on privacy”It was experimenting new ways to invade privacy to feed Cliqz’s search engine database from user’s browsing. It was a horrible spyware.“the popular privacy-focused extension, Ghostery”https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/privacy/ Cliqz’s “Ghostery Rewards” targets ads from browsing data, “Human Web” fed the now defunct search engine from browsing data, both described as opt-out, in a product users expect to be about “blocking trackers”. Yeah, “privacy-focused”, Mr Ashwin. Great piece of independent tech journalism again.@Anonymous> Not having the full actual private data on a distant server does not matter as long as they can process it as they wish against the user with local malicious code. It’s even part of Google’s “privacy sandbox” ideas. Another famous “user-first, fighting the advertising and data industry” company.This part is interesting: Where do you see the privacy violation when no data leaves the PC? Every step of the process of ad matching in Brave happens locally, they have none of your browsing details on any server they might have. And “malicious”… Seriously? It’s disabled by default and they mention it repeatedly on their website (from which the browser is downloaded), so even if users choose to enable it, I think they can’t claim to be uninformed (which is a key part of “malicious”). And even then, funny malware that doesn’t report back to its master, I must say. -.-Iron Heart is losing this battle, and I’m not happy about it. Another good browser going down the drain.@ungoogled> Iron Heart is losing this battleHow? I am not affiliated with Brave Software, if the browser stops meeting my needs, I’ll just switch. It’s as simple as that. I am skeptical of this acquisition.“I’m not a fan of Ghostery or Brave for that matter” And why do you not like Brave, do you have any special reason? I mean, while there are tons of desktop browsers, there are still not many serious desktop browsers around. You either like Chrome and evil Google, Edge from evil Microsoft, Firefox from evil Mozilla promoters of censorship and deplatform of people, Vivaldi with its closed sourced UI that makes Vivaldi customizable and beautiful but slower plus other stuff I don’t agree about the CEO and the company. Opera = CCP. Yandex= Putinland. And we get many forks but most are just not updated fast enough to ensure you will be fine from the dangers of the internet and Firefox or Chormium bugs or they are there to support old stuff I don’t care like Palemoon, etc. So yes, Brave might not be perfect but “not liking it” is not a reason and I am sure what you currently use is not any better (something tells me you like Firefox like most people promoting a false sense of privacy or maybe the useless ideology like “we need more than chromium so I will force myself to use and like Firefox even if hey openly promote censorship”Anyway, so you know, Mr Ashwin, I don’t use Brave Rewards so I am sure it is a Browser and if you want the BATs then you can have it. So I already answered your question, it is actually a browser with a decent Adblocker that they keep improving, the ONLY chromium browser with CNAME filtering and other features unique to Brave, Tor (government made and funded, so it can’t be trusted but exists), first one trying to integrate IPFS, ONLY one giving you sync without requesting any information from you, no emails or phone numbers or anything, also they are trying to do some R&D about how to improve adblocking and its lists to make things more efficient and faster and fingerprinting protection that no other browser offers because Brave is the only one trying to improve it unlike others. so what is your reason?ANYWAY, I actually was waiting for this post from you, ready with popcorn and a smile, because I am sure people will end up talking the same crap they do about Brave.On Twitter and Reddit, I already read the usual misinformation and hate about Brave, people still bringing the Affiliate link misbehavior not even understanding the issue, and just parroting about it. Talking about it like “how terrible and non-privacy liars Brave are”, like if bugs didn’t exist on any software, and even if Brave fixed it fast, they still complain about it. Apparently people can’t understand that Affiliate link problem ONLY happened on binance addresses, which means only the person reporting it “got affected”, and I mean it in quotes because the person could have changed address for the one with non affiliate link, and realistically, how many people go to binance website, how many brave users? so I am sure less than 10 people got affected by it. But people are dishonest and lie about it.I mean, I still see people talking crap about Eich, and how terrible person he is because he donated to blablbla and how in 2020s he talking against mask and lockdowns based on statistics is misinformation, so he is so terrible nobody should support Brave because he is intolerable and hates, yet, the ones supposedly being so affected by him are intolerant to his views so we get the usual hypocrisy.Just dumb excuses to complain about this news, which I think is good. If people read Brave’s blogpost and PDF talking about goggles, they would understand how this is a good news for people. It even talks about how it will respect people’s not only privacy but freedom of thought. Sampson replied a tweet about it saying “Brave Search’s community-curated ranking models are specifically designed to “prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship,” from our blog post today. You shouldn’t have Big Tech telling you what you can and cannot search online.”That’s the interesting thing, we have companies actually promoting censorship and virtue signaling and “I speak against this but cover my eyes for a similar situation because it doesn’t fit my political agenda” and we have Brave, the only ‘big’ browser company that is promoting anticensorship. is that a negative thing? because people talk crap about them and I bet it will happen happen like usual, media and others will start making articles about how “X is helping spread misinformation” even if they can’t even prove the supposedly misinformation they talk about is misinformation because only saying “it is misinformation” it is not proving anything, and believing the big tech and mainstream media to tell them what is or not misinformation is just being completely naïve about real life and how humans barely do anything with “good intentions” and to help others or because “we care about you” or some BS like that, there is always a reason behind and talking about big tech and mainstream, I doubt it is good. Obviously Brave does too, they want to make a business through privacy, not messing with people’s privacy but actually promote it, while truly fixing many problems on the modern internet, I mean, It is stupid to think ads will become irrelevant or disappear in the future, so what’s wrong with trying to fix the internet by addressing the ads problem rather than just pretend it will get fixed by Google? If Brave so the same thing we see, how problematic ads are for privacy because google never cared to fix them and nobody else did, then good for them, I am still not forced to see Brave ads or use Brave rewards, although I know money is important to run a business, if not you are not totally independent you will have to depend like some companies on running thanks to google’s money which doesn’t sound good.I see some people talking about DuckDuckGo and saying “what about DDG? we already have a solution” But first, reading about CEOs past and company mistakes, I never really trust them, I still use them, of course they can’t be worst than google, but I have seen DDG manipulating results = doing what Google does but at a lower scale since they are not so powerful. But In one case Searx DDG engine displayed the result correctly when you tired to find this nonmainstream news website, but somehow it wasn’t found in normal DDG until people complained and they fixed it, and I am not talking the result of the website address was displayed 10 search results below, it was completely removed from the results. Also I saw on DDG reddit how someone complaining about some search result images that “hurt” the person, and demanded DDG team to change it because if not, that meant DDG was a terrible search engine since I guess those images being displayed on top of everything ‘hurt’ the user. So DDG removed all the images from search results, if now I do the search, it’s like 100+ images until I see something, and if I want to see those search results I have to specify them but they are not displayed to me like before, I mean, I didn’t care, I just saw someone complaining and did the test, saw the images and next few hours I didn’t see them anymore. But supposedly DDG gives you the result based on how people search them, not if they hurt or not, and fixing some results make sense but completely remove them for the demand of a single user, seems a bit weird (I know the reasons, and it has to do with an agenda). But if DDG can easily manipulate the results like in those both cases I witnessed, someone has to wonder how many more times have DDG team done that? How many search results they have changed and manipulated because more users searched for it so they displayed first? how many websites have they removed completely from search results and nobody notices it? or how many times they display mainstream news on top of others that people searched more just because they wanted to?Well, this is why Brave search could be important and that’s what Brave team talks about anticensorship and others tell you what and how to think. Of course let’s hope results are good and all. And that’s why I am interested. There is a big difference between illegal content and freedom of thought, and that’s what Brave search in their PDF seems to have to address, I mean, how many times people said it was a conspiracy and tinfoil blabla about government ‘watching us’ and people rejected the information as “conspiracy theories” (a dumb term made for manipulating the masses anyway), some people made their minds about it without even research it, others didn’t even know about it because “mainstream media hasn’t spoke about it”, now people are all worried about privacy and governments this and surveillance that, same with other subjects, even if people want to call it whatever they want, it doesn’t take that it might be true or it is partially true, or maybe it is not true but it will not affect anything or anyone if people believe it or not, many subjects that people ignore that have turned “to be true” and people still deny it because Big tech and mainstream media bury the subject or call it names without being open and objective. So yes, I would rather support a project that will not even try to fight the privacy problem of google and microsoft but also the censorship many companies promote because they want to control how you think, what you do, how you do it, where you do it. They want to become like this “internet totalitarian government” so if you don’t think like they want you to think, you should be banned, deplatform and censored from the internet and also Cancelled and destroyed in real life, like losing jobs, contracts and anything like that, which is not even new, I have seen it for so many years, people who go to jail for trying to find the truth, 70+ years old going to jail for not accepting official narratives or living with a thousand monthly because they got their life destroyed so much by others that they could never find a job for speaking what they thought would find the truth that they didn’t find, so the more companies and people trying to battle all this mess where big tech and others want to act like a government nobody voted for but tells who should use the internet or not, the better.+1Duckduckgo uses Google track severs and Microsoft Binge trackers….I read a story about it. So them too are a bunch of liars.Will Brave internal adblocker allow blocking of those ads in the search results ? Or will users be forced to accept them without a choice ?@WorriedAboutAdsYou can set custom filters under brave://adblock/ in case they allow them. Brave also supports extensions, so I am not worried about that (though I will never use their search engine).@IronHeartI am curious to know how much bitcoin the average user could expect to get in a year? for opting into the ad-system in Brave and just doing general everyday browsing?Some content creators are making some serious bucks from it, but how much does an average user get?Also who are the main advertisers on Brave? How much money does Brave get?@Anon7Used to be ca. 25 BAT per month (many hours of usage daily, 5 ads per hour setting) a few months ago, when the BAT price was approx. 0.20$ = 1 BAT. It is lesser now, because BAT proven to be volatile and has now reached higher price levels:https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/If one kept the BAT over the last 1 1/2 years, the sum isn’t too shabby.However, contrary to what many * [Editor: removed, stay polite] believe here, the actual percentage of Brave users who use Brave Rewards was below 10% last time I checked (presumably because frequent system notifications are annoying?), and Brave Software has repeatedly said that they do NOT expect the majority of Brave users to enable Brave Rewards going forward.> Also who are the main advertisers on Brave?Good question, don’t know if an extensive list exists (and if so, it would also fluctuate most likely); I’ve found those:https://old.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/gt97wa/brave_advertisers_are_getting_more_mainstream/ https://brave.com/brave-ads/Personally, as far as I remember, I got ads from the following companies so far upon testing: Amazon, NordVPN, ProtonMail, Verizon, various crypto-related companies, Visa, BlockFi etc. But that might reflect my own interests more than it is a general overview – because after all, the ads are locally matched against my own browsing.> How much money does Brave get?https://browserpulse.com/how-does-brave-make-money/@IronHeart> Used to be ca. 25 BAT per month (many hours of usage daily, 5 ads per hour setting) a few months ago, when the BAT price was approx. 0.20$ = 1 BAT.Now i see why so many content creators (even privacy ones) want Brave to do well. Good way to tip censored content creators.I may dislike Brave and crap on it at times, however, i don’t disagree that it is an excellent way for censored content creators to get around the GOOLAG and earn a coin or too. I can see why they promote it.That is one thing i would comment Eich for, even if i don’t fully trust the dude lol.@Anon7I think that it’s not only “censored content creators” (might well be among them, I doubt it’s anywhere close to a relevant percentage) – Brave is a successful project, I already see major websites being registered.Also, whom do you trust? If you don’t mind me asking…Whatever, I will not use that search engine. I’ve tried pretty much every one out there – Startpage, Duck Duck Go, Qwant, Bing… Google Search is still the best in serving results, I’m even down with dealing with Google’s increasing bullshit, because it just saves me so much time compared to pretending to be some tinfoil hat-wearing paranoid conspiracy theorist.So you’re a top-tier tinfoil hat-wearing paranoid conspiracy theorist only when it comes to Microsoft? Gotcha!Can you deny or disprove that Windows 10 has been acting more and more like malware?When you disable telemetry, it enables itself. When you open IE, it bombards you with ads for Edge. Then it automatically starts Chromium Edge without asking, showing some small window in the top right corner that won’t go away until you do something in Edge. You uninstall Chromium Edge, you get bombarded with ads for Chromium Edge in old Edge. Then on some Windows Update, Chromium Edge is automatically installed without any indication or asking the user for permission.In contrast all Google does in the moment is having an annoying cookie prompt when you load it for the first time or in Incognito mode. Using the Inspect/Developer Tools of the browser, I can delete that part, or I can create uBlock Origin rules to block these prompts automatically, I just don’t bother, I’m sure uBlock Origin’s developer will eventually include them.And back to Microsoft, if you think this is double standards, it certainly isn’t. Windows XP, Vista, 7 did not act like malware. If Google continues to act in the same aggressive way, I will just switch to some different search engine and stop using YouTube. I don’t even have a YouTube on my phone, because NewPipe’s API constantly breaks and I you can’t watch videos until the developer releases an update. YouTube Vanced somehow got riddled with ads somehow and I stopped using that too. I use the browser version of YouTube, because Kiwi Browser has uBlock Origin and I can block all ads just fine. There used to be a website called TOOGL.ES, which had a YouTube API and it only showed the videos so you could see how fast YouTube can be if all the bloat from the official website is shred. But if Google tries to push it even further, I will even abandon YouTube and give up watching my favorite content creators there… Sure, not ideal, but more time for different activities.So don’t get any stupid ideas, because you don’t know me, you’re just a local clown.@Allwynd > You uninstall Chromium Edge, you get bombarded with ads for Chromium Edge in old Edge.No, it’s even better now ) If you uninstall CE, it will reinstall itself after the next boot using edgeupdate service. And you cannot disable it. In order to do that you need to download the special Administrative template for group policies and then disable edgeupdate through gpedit. I shit you not! I discovered this behaviour a few days ago and was really impressed by shear greatness of MS.I don’t have ANY Edge problems because I disabled it on the Startup tab in Task manager. Rocket science it is not.“don’t get any stupid ideas” – Pfft, what sort of moron threatens a stranger on the internet from his momma’s basement while hiding behind his keyboard and employing an assumed name? Lol, talk about oafish and idiotic behavior!Anyone who claims Google cares more about privacy or its products/sites behave less like data stealing malware than MS’ needs to seriously have his head examined.“There will be two tiers in Brave Search; an ad-free premium search, while the other will be an ad-supported search as described above. ”Total crap.

However, he admitted that the CISA became overwhelmed, enabling many Twitter conspiracies to make their way to right wing news programs and former President Donald Trump. “It just wasn’t enough to eat away,” Krebs said. “And that was ultimately I think where we lost the advantage for rumor control.”The analysts from EIP said that Trump and his allies played an active role in spreading these conspiracies. In reference to how long right wing partisans had spread disinformation, Emerson Brooking, senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Lab of the Atlantic Council — a D.C. research group focused on cybersecurity and disinformation — said that the now infamous slogan “Stop the Steal” was created by Roger Stone, one of Trump’s closest allies, in 2016. University of Washington human centered design & engineering professor Kate Starbird ’97 stressed that Trump’s incessant election fraud claims during the summer and early fall of 2020 served as the point of origin for the spree of election disinformation post November. “President Trump in his campaign didn’t just prime his audience to be receptive to narratives of voter fraud, they inspired them to produce these narratives themselves, and then echoed those false claims back to them,” Starbird said.Andrew Beers, a second-year human centered design & engineering Ph.D. student at UW, presented a graphical analysis that detailed the greatest spreaders of disinformation on social media, which included former President Trump, his two adult sons, Sean Hannity, James O’Keefe and other far-right “self-described news sources.”However, the experts did not lay all the blame on Trump. Krebs acknowledged that “an expanding number of state and non-state actors” propagated lies and conspiracies to manipulate the charged political atmosphere.According to Brooking, EIP’s research found that disinformation spread through both a “top-down” process — which saw right-wing influencers intentionally rile their base with provocative insinuations of a stolen election as we’’ — and  a “bottom-up” process — in which individuals would share their perceptions on what they believed to be evidence of a stolen election, and their stories would garner enough attention on social media until it made its way to the preeminent right-wing influencers.Starbird highlighted specific instances of the “bottom-up” and top-down” disinformation dynamic. Starbird pointed to Sharpie Gate: A panicked theory among Trump voters in Arizona that poll workers purposely handed them Sharpies to fill out ballots in order to make their votes illegible to the machine.Krebs believes that both public and private entities must be involved in countering these disinformation issues. He proposed the creation of a “Counter Disinfo Czar,” a U.S. government position devoted to minimizing disinformation. Corporate executives are also key to this effort and must actively work to prevent perpetuating disinformation through their businesses, according to Krebs.The CISA utilized this multidimensional approach, said Krebs, and worked closely with state and local partners in the private sector, academia and the federal government “to protect the 2020 election and defend democracy” under his direction. It is crucial to implement a series of cybersecurity policy recommendations that are directed at maximizing the security of and public faith in democratic elections, said director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab Graham Brookie. He further emphasized that there should be “overarching transparency information sharing” moving forward for American elections.We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Making sense of AI


					From podcasts to Clubhouse, branded audio is more important than ever. Learn how brands are increasing customer loyalty and personalization with these best practices.				Join Transform 2021 for the most important themes in enterprise AI & Data. Learn more.In late 2019, researchers affiliated with Facebook, New York University (NYU), the University of Washington, and DeepMind proposed SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for AI designed to summarize research progress on a diverse set of language tasks. Building on the GLUE benchmark, which had been introduced one year prior, SuperGLUE includes a set of more difficult language understanding challenges, improved resources, and a publicly available leaderboard.When SuperGLUE was introduced, there was a nearly 20-point gap between the best-performing model and human performance on the leaderboard. But as of early January, two models — one from Microsoft called DeBERTa and a second from Google called T5 + Meena — have surpassed the human baselines, becoming the first to do so.Sam Bowman, assistant professor at NYU’s center for data science, said the achievement reflected innovations in machine learning including self-supervised learning, where models learn from unlabeled datasets with recipes for adapting the insights to target tasks. “These datasets reflect some of the hardest supervised language understanding task datasets that were freely available two years ago,” he said. “There’s no reason to believe that SuperGLUE will be able to detect further progress in natural language processing, at least beyond a small remaining margin.”But SuperGLUE isn’t a perfect — nor a complete — test of human language ability. In a blog post, the Microsoft team behind DeBERTa themselves noted that their model is “by no means” reaching the human-level intelligence of natural language understanding. They say this will require research breakthroughs, along with new benchmarks to measure them and their effects.As the researchers wrote in the paper introducing SuperGLUE, their benchmark is intended to be a simple, hard-to-game measure of advances toward general-purpose language understanding technologies for English. It comprises eight language understanding tasks drawn from existing data and accompanied by a performance metric as well as an analysis toolkit.The tasks are:SuperGLUE also attempts to measure gender bias in models with Winogender Schemas, pairs of sentences that differ only by the gender of one pronoun in the sentence. However, the researchers note that this measure has limitations in that it offers only positive predictive value: While a poor bias score is clear evidence that a model exhibits gender bias, a good score doesn’t mean the model is unbiased. Moreover, it doesn’t include all forms of gender or social bias, making it a coarse measure of prejudice.To establish human performance baselines, the researchers drew on existing literature for WiC, MultiRC, RTE, and ReCoRD and hired crowdworker annotators through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Each worker, paid an average of $23.75 an hour, completed a short training phase before annotating up to 30 samples of selected test sets using instructions and an FAQ page.The Google team hasn’t yet detailed the improvements that led to its model’s record-setting performance on SuperGLUE, but the Microsoft researchers behind DeBERTa detailed their work in a blog post published earlier this morning. DeBERTa isn’t new — it was open-sourced last year — but the researchers say they trained a larger version with 1.5 billion parameters (i.e., the internal variables that the model uses to make predictions). It’ll be released in open source and integrated into the next version of Microsoft’s Turing natural language representation model, which supports products like Bing, Office, Dynamics, and Azure Cognitive Services.DeBERTa is pretrained through masked language modeling (MLM), a fill-in-the-blank task where a model is taught to use the words surrounding a masked “token” to predict what the masked word should be. DeBERTa uses both the content and position information of context words for MLM, such that it’s able to recognize “store” and “mall” in the sentence “a new store opened beside the new mall” play different syntactic roles, for example.Unlike some other models, DeBERTa accounts for words’ absolute positions in the language modeling process. Moreover, it computes the parameters within the model that transform input data and measure the strength of word-word dependencies based on words’ relative positions. For example, DeBERTa would understand the dependency between the words “deep” and “learning” is much stronger when they occur next to each other than when they occur in different sentences.DeBERTa also benefits from adversarial training, a technique that leverages adversarial examples derived from small variations made to training data. These adversarial examples are fed to the model during the training process, improving its generalizability.The Microsoft researchers hope to next explore how to enable DeBERTa to generalize to novel tasks of subtasks or basic problem-solving skills, a concept known as compositional generalization. One path forward might be incorporating so-called compositional structures more explicitly, which could entail combining AI with symbolic reasoning — in other words, manipulating symbols and expressions according to mathematical and logical rules.“DeBERTa surpassing human performance on SuperGLUE marks an important milestone toward general AI,” the Microsoft researchers wrote. “[But unlike DeBERTa,] humans are extremely good at leveraging the knowledge learned from different tasks to solve a new task with no or little task-specific demonstration.”According to Bowman, no successor to SuperGLUE is forthcoming, at least not in the near term. But there’s growing consensus within the AI research community that future benchmarks, particularly in the language domain, must take into account broader ethical, technical, and societal challenges if they’re to be useful.For example, a number of studies show that popular benchmarks do a poor job of estimating real-world AI performance. One recent report found that 60%-70% of answers given by natural language processing models were embedded somewhere in the benchmark training sets, indicating that the models were usually simply memorizing answers. Another study — a meta-analysis of over 3,000 AI papers — found that metrics used to benchmark AI and machine learning models tended to be inconsistent, irregularly tracked, and not particularly informative.Part of the problem stems from the fact that language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3, Google’s T5 + Meena, and Microsoft’s DeBERTa learn to write humanlike text by internalizing examples from the public web. Drawing on sources like ebooks, Wikipedia, and social media platforms like Reddit, they make inferences to complete sentences and even whole paragraphs.As a result, language models often amplify the biases encoded in this public data; a portion of the training data is not uncommonly sourced from communities with pervasive gender, race, and religious prejudices. AI research firm OpenAI notes that this can lead to placing words like “naughty” or “sucked” near female pronouns and “Islam” near words like “terrorism.” Other studies, like one published by Intel, MIT, and Canadian AI initiative CIFAR researchers in April, have found high levels of stereotypical bias from some of the most popular models, including Google’s BERT and XLNet, OpenAI’s GPT-2, and Facebook’s RoBERTa. This bias could be leveraged by malicious actors to foment discord by spreading misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies that “radicalize individuals into violent far-right extremist ideologies and behaviors,” according to the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.Most existing language benchmarks fail to capture this. Motivated by the findings in the two years since SuperGLUE’s introduction, perhaps future ones might.

123,Lawmaker to Reintroduce Net Neutrality Legislation Within Weeks - Supporters say giving the Federal Communications Commission greater authority over internet service providers is more important in the wake of the pandemic.,Net Neutrality,https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2021/03/lawmaker-reintroduce-net-neutrality-legislation-within-weeks/172403/,"

Sen. Ed Markey plans to introduce legislation in the coming weeks to restore net neutrality rules put in place during the Obama administration. With a shift in political dynamics following the 2020 election, lawmakers are renewing their push to police internet service providers under Title II of the Communications Act, and this time, the pandemic emphasizes a powerful point in the debate, the Massachusetts Democrat said.  Net neutrality sets forth that providers of broadband services should treat all internet traffic equally, not blocking, throttling or prioritizing any one set of content or data over another for commercial purposes.“Today, broadband is the single most important service that Americans use to communicate with one another, and the COVID pandemic has highlighted what we already knew,” Markey said. “Broadband isn't a luxury: It is essential to everyone in our country.” Markey spoke Tuesday along with Reps. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., and Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., at an event hosted by Fight for the Future and other advocates of consumers’ digital rights. “Once we have three Democrats in place at the [Federal Communications Commission], I'm going to strongly urge the commission to reverse the Trump FCC's wrongheaded decision and restore net neutrality and the FCC's authority over broadband,” Markey said. “And in the coming weeks, I'm also planning on reintroducing legislation to do the same by statute. Here's the bottom line: Whether it's in the halls of the FCC or in the halls of Congress, we will not stop working until net neutrality is the law of the land.” The status of net neutrality at the federal level has shifted back and forth over the years based on which political party is in power. Democrats have generally favored giving the FCC more power to enforce net neutrality principles, while Republicans argue that’s unnecessarily restrictive and that the companies are meeting their obligations to provide widespread, non-discriminatory access to broadband services.The pandemic has raised the stakes. During Tuesday’s event, Baltimore Councilmember Zeke Cohen said it was only after protests from students and others that Comcast increased the performance of its Internet Essentials program, its lowest grade offering that is available at $10 per month.The program was “simply too slow to maintain programs like Google classrooms or Zoom” and was “the only game in town,” Cohen said, adding “an extra $10 a month can put someone over the edge” in cities like Baltimore. Cohen also shared concerns about the refusal of Comcast—which signed a franchise agreement with his city—to share data on the distribution of its services and the company’s willingness to impose arbitrary data caps at such a crucial time.“To me, there's just a whole lack of transparency and data caps is the ultimate cynical example of an extractive large corporation, taking advantage of vulnerable people in a pandemic,” he said, noting that other cities are no doubt experiencing similar challenges.Classifying broadband as a telecommunications service, as the FCC did under the Obama administration, would allow regulators to treat internet service providers as essential public utilities under Title II of the Communications Act and to have more control of and insight into the actions of ISPs, as they do with telephone services. The FCC used this power to pass privacy and cybersecurity rules for ISPs. The rules would have required companies to gain opt-in consent of consumers in order to access their browsing data and other sensitive information for commercial purposes. They also would have required the ISPs to follow reasonable data security practices and to notify customers and law enforcement when they are breached.Congress used the Congressional Review Act to undo the rules and to stop the FCC from implementing them again. But speaking at the event Tuesday, Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge, said there’s now an opportunity to make them more robust. “We had the incredibly strong privacy rules that were put in place at the end of the Obama administration,” Feld said. “The Republican Congress used a congressional resolution of disapproval to eliminate those rules but that's OK because once there is Title II it means we're clear to create even stronger and better rules for privacy on the internet, Americans have long expected that their phone calls are private, and they should be able to expect that their internet use is private.” Markey noted that with a recent court ruling allowing California to enforce its own law, and net neutrality champions now holding the reins on Capitol Hill, “a new day has dawned in Washington and around our country.” “We have a whole new era of net neutrality, which is just beginning,” he said.

Certain licenses have been granted, including for small numbers of expensive equipment in recent days.As policy shifts under President Joe Biden, who took over from Donald Trump in January, U.S. government agencies led by new appointees still have not completely decided what should be sold to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which produces chips for Qualcomm Inc and other American companies.The Trump administration placed SMIC on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s entity list over concerns of SMIC aiding China’s military.The listing, which requires U.S. suppliers to obtain a license before shipping goods to SMIC, is unusual because it says most products should be granted on a case-by-case basis. However, equipment that can be used to make only the most advanced, 10-nanometer and smaller chips is likely to be denied licenses.The administration is supposed to make decisions on license applications within a month, but follow-up questions stop the clock.“Lam Research is still in the application process and has not yet received a response,” a Fremont, California, company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Applied Materials’ chief financial officer said in a Feb. 18 earnings call its forecast did not assume licenses would come through. A spokesman for the Santa Clara, California-based company declined further comment on the licenses this week.SMIC did not respond to requests for comment, but the company has said it provides services solely for civilian and commercial end users and that it has no ties to the Chinese military.Decisions on licenses have been held up as officials ask follow-up questions about applications in part to determine whether the parts or components could be diverted for use in producing items 10 nm or smaller, sources said.Washington trade lawyer Giovanna Cinelli said many license applications have resulted in “a lot of back and forth, which has elongated the period of review.”In a statement, a Commerce Department official dismissed the possibility that curbs on SMIC could contribute to the chip shortage, noting that the shortfall was tied to older technologies while SMIC restrictions relate to leading-edge technology. The statement did not address the potential impact of delays in licenses for older technology.SMIC, the largest foundry in mainland China, is an important player in the global semiconductor supply chain, which is under pressure as pandemic lockdowns drive up demand for electronics such as laptops and phones. Last month, it said it could not meet customer demands for certain technologies and its plants have been running “fully loaded” for several quarters.SMIC’s technological capabilities lag far behind cutting-edge foundries like industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, according to industry sources.Companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research, two key suppliers of production equipment, submitted numerous license applications to sell to the company. The bulk have not yet been acted on, industry sources said.A spokeswoman for Entegris Inc, an advanced materials supplier, said the Massachusetts-based company had submitted 10 applications to sell to SMIC and received its first license in the past week.Other companies that ship to SMIC include California’s KLA Corp and Massachusetts-based Axcelis Technologies Inc . A KLA spokeswoman declined to comment on any licenses and, while Axcelis’ CEO spoke of “uncertainty” related to its licenses on Feb. 11, a company spokeswoman declined to provide an update.Cymer, a San Diego company that makes deep ultraviolet light sources, is also among suppliers that need licenses to send parts to SMIC. A spokeswoman for ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker that owns Cymer, declined to comment on the licenses, saying she could not discuss customer-specific information.Qualcomm, which uses the Chinese foundry to produce chips with decades-old technology, put in applications for tools SMIC needs to produce the chips, just in case equipment makers do not get their licenses for the tools, an industry source said. But they have not come through yet, the source added.In September, SEMI, a worldwide industry group, said in a draft letter seen by Reuters that SMIC accounts for as much as $5 billion in annual U.S. sales.Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper in Washington; Editing by Chris Sanders, Shri Navaratnam and Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The U.S. is in danger of falling behind China and Russia in developing artificial intelligence technologies and countering cybersecurity threats that could develop as AI use becomes more widespread, according to a newly released report from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.See Also: Illumination Summit: Poker & Cybersecurity: A Game of Skill, Not LuckThe 750-page report offers more than 60 recommendations for how the U.S. could become the world leader in developing and deploying AI technologies as well as how to counter threats that leverage AI, including disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks by nation-states. The commission recommends many of the same changes to national policy that the Cyberspace Solarium Commission advocated in a 2020 report.""AI is deepening the threat posed by cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns that Russia, China and others are using to infiltrate our society, steal our data and interfere in our democracy,"" according to the report's executive summary. ""The limited uses of AI-enabled attacks to date represent the tip of the iceberg.""The report, released Monday, is the result of nearly two years' worth of work by the 15-member commission, which was created as part of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.In addition to recommending the rethinking of the government's approach to artificial intelligence, the report calls for Congress to authorize the spending of billions of dollars to fund the development of AI, machine learning and other technologies to help the U.S. better compete as well as protect critical assets from security threats.The commission's report recommends increasing spending on research and development to $8 billion by 2025, up from $1.5 billion in 2022. Commissioners also recommend that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence spend $1 billion annually from 2022 to 2032 to study the effects that AI will have on a host of cybersecurity and national security issues.The report also calls for the U.S. to spend millions developing programs to foster engineering and other skills needed to create, harness and deploy AI and machine-learning technologies.In an opening letter to the report, Eric Schmidt, the chair of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence and former CEO of Google, and Robert O. Work, the vice chair, note the U.S. needs to create a holistic approach that balances the development of AI technologies and countermeasures to fend off threats from nation-states and hackers deploying AI.""AI is dual-use, often open source and diffusing rapidly,"" Schmidt and Work note. ""State adversaries are already using AI-enabled disinformation attacks to sow division in democracies and jar our sense of reality. States, criminals and terrorists will conduct AI-powered cyberattacks and pair AI software with commercially available drones to create 'smart weapons.'""Lauren Christopher, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis who has studied the effects of AI, believes that the commission was right to focus on how China and Russia are developing artificial intelligence technologies and that the U.S. needs to invest more to keep pace.""Of the technologies outlined in the report, increasing the talent pool and bringing chip design back on-shore are spot-on,"" Christopher tells Information Security Media Group. ""The U.S. needs to invest more and have leadership strategies in place. There is much already done in the U.S. on AI topics, but much more to do.""The report notes that while AI and machine learning are still in early stages of development, they're already being misused. This includes using deepfakes to spread disinformation (see: How Deepfakes Can Defeat Video ID Verification Tests).""Rival states are already using AI-powered malign information,"" the report notes. ""In the United States, the private sector has taken the leading role in combating foreign malign information. Social media companies in particular have extensive operations to track and manage information on their platforms. But coordination between the government and the social media firms remains ad hoc. We need a more integrated public-private response to the problem of foreign-generated disinformation.""The report adds that the theft of personally identifiable information, and the use of this data to feed algorithms to target potential victims, also remains a major concern. The theft of personal data in 2015 from the U.S.  Office of Personnel Management should serve as a warning about how nation-states can steal and then attempt to use data to track individuals.""For the government to treat the data of its citizens and businesses as a national security asset, substantial changes are required in the way we think about data security and in our policies and laws to strengthen it,"" the report notes.The commission makes several recommendations. It calls for:The report also warns that AI and machine-learning technology will be able to spread malware much faster and give operators new ways to create malicious code that can quickly take advantage of vulnerabilities in 5G networks and IoT devices.Polymorphic malware already accounts for more than 90% of malicious executable files spotted in the wild, the commission says.Besides addressing national security and cybersecurity concerns, the commission examined the deployment of AI throughout the military, including the development and deployment of autonomous weapon systems.The U.S. Department of Defense has developed autonomous systems that have certain safeguards, such as requiring a human operator to authorize their use, the report notes.The U.S. should take a lead role in promoting the responsible use of AI in weapons systems, especially those that can control nuclear weapons, the commission says.""The United States should make a clear, public statement that decisions to authorize nuclear weapons employment must only be made by humans, not by an AI-enabled or autonomous system, and should include such an affirmation in the DoD's next Nuclear Posture Review,"" the report notes. ""The United States should also actively press Russia and China, as well as other states that possess nuclear weapons, to issue similar statements.""Schmidt testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, urging lawmakers to read the report and take action on its recommendations.""A bold, bipartisan initiative can extend our country’s technology advantage - but only if we act now,"" Schmidt told the panel. ""Success matters for more than our companies' bottom lines and our military's battlefield edge. To that end, I urge Congress again to adopt all of our AI commission recommendations, which provide a clear blueprint to win a technology competition that is centered around AI.""Managing Editor, News DeskFerguson is the managing editor for the news desk at Information Security Media Group.

127,"Parler unleashes 15-count lawsuit on Amazon, alleging defamation, bullying and bias for Twitter",Business,https://www.geekwire.com/2021/parler-unleashes-15-count-lawsuit-amazon-alleging-defamation-bullying-bias-twitter/,"by Todd Bishop on March 3, 2021 at 8:00 amMarch 3, 2021 at 10:30 amParler wasn’t ending its fight against Amazon Web Services last night when it abruptly dropped its suit seeking to require the cloud giant to resume hosting its service.In an entirely new case, filed Tuesday afternoon in King County Superior Court in Seattle, the conservative social media platform alleges defamation, negligence, breach of contract, and a litany of other charges against Amazon. Parler says it has lost “tens of millions of current and prospective future users” and “hundreds of millions of dollars in annual advertising revenue.”The 15-count, 66-page complaint claims that Amazon was acting in bad faith, with ulterior motives, when it cut Parler off from AWS on Jan. 9, shortly after Twitter and Facebook banned then-President Donald Trump from their platforms. The suit seeks a jury trial and unspecified financial damages.The suit claims that Amazon misrepresented Parler’s content moderation efforts and its role in the U.S. Capitol riots when AWS said in its termination letter that it “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.”The suit says Parler had been communicating regularly with Amazon in its quest for effective technical solutions for moderation. It alleges that Amazon compounded the defamation by leaking the termination letter to the press.“In short, these false claims have made Parler a pariah and severely damaged its once-booming business,” the suit says.Amazon issued this statement in response to the suit Wednesday morning.“There is no merit to these claims. AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, as shown by the evidence in Parler’s federal lawsuit, it was clear that there was significant content on Parler that encouraged and incited violence against others, which is a violation of our terms of service. Further, Parler was unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which coupled with an increase in this type of dangerous violent content, led to our suspension of their services.”The complaint cites internal emails to Parler executives from an Amazon official who “became increasingly inquisitive as to whether Parler’s CEO had heard whether that would occur in the wake of Facebook and Twitter banning the former President,” as the complaint puts it.Parler portrays its removal from AWS as an underhanded business tactic, alleging that Amazon and other tech giants were threatened by its advertising model.“[U]nlike AWS/Amazon, Twitter, Google and Facebook, Parler’s business model enabled it to obtain advertising revenues without the user surveillance necessary to target ads to users based upon personal information collected by the platform—a feature very attractive to many users and, hence, to advertisers seeking to reach them,” the suit says.The suit also points to the announcement of a multi-year contract between AWS and Twitter on Dec. 15.“Given the context of Parler’s looming competitive threat to Twitter, as well as to AWS, Google, and Facebook, and given the fact that the Facebook and Twitter bans might not long muzzle the former President if he switched to Parler, potentially bringing tens of millions of followers with him, AWS moved to shut down Parler,” the complaint says.Parler seeks to portray the move as part of a broader pattern of anticompetitive behavior by Amazon.“AWS generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for Amazon,” the complaint says. “And, when companies are this big, it’s easy to be a bully. Many start-up companies that have appeared to be a threat to Amazon and AWS have felt their wrath. Plaintiff Parler LLC is merely the latest casualty—a victim of Amazon’s efforts to destroy an up-and-coming technology company through deceptive, defamatory, anticompetitive, and bad faith conduct.”Parler relaunched its service on Feb. 15 using what it described as “sustainable, independent technology.” The company at the time appointed attorney and political activist Mark Meckler as its interim CEO, replacing co-founder John Matze, who said he was fired as CEO by the Parler board earlier in February.Here’s the full text of the complaint.Parler v.

129,Brave is launching its own search engine with the help of ex-Cliqz devs and tech,Software,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/,"Brave, the privacy-focused browser co-founded by ex-Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, is getting ready to launch an own-brand search engine for desktop and mobile.Today it’s announced the acquisition of an open source search engine developed by the team behind the (now defunct) Cliqz anti-tracking search-browser combo. The tech will underpin the forthcoming Brave Search engine — meaning it will soon be pitching its millions of users on an entirely ‘big tech’-free search and browsing experience.“Under the hood, nearly all of today’s search engines are either built by, or rely on, results from Big Tech companies. In contrast, the Tailcat search engine is built on top of a completely independent index, capable of delivering the quality people expect but without compromising their privacy,” Brave writes in a press release announcing the acquisition.“Tailcat does not collect IP addresses or use personally identifiable information to improve search results.”Cliqz, which was a privacy-focused European fork of Mozilla’s Firefox browser, got shuttered last May after its majority investor, Hubert Burda Media, called time on the multi-year effort to build momentum for an alternative to Google — blaming tougher trading conditions during the pandemic for forcing it to pull the plug sooner than it would have liked.Cliqz pulls the plug on a European anti-tracking alternative to Google searchThe former Cliqz dev team, who had subsequently been working on Tailcat, are moving to Brave as part of the acquisition. The engineering team is led by Dr Josep M Pujol — who is quoted in Brave’s PR saying it’s “excited to be working on the only real private search/browser alternative to Big Tech”.“Tailcat is a fully independent search engine with its own search index built from scratch,” Eich told TechCrunch. “Tailcat as Brave Search will offer the same privacy guarantees that Brave has in its browser.“Brave will provide the first private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms, and will make it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy. Also, owing to its transparent nature, Brave Search will address algorithmic biases and prevent outright censorship.”Brave getting into the search business is a reflection of its confidence that privacy is becoming mainstream, per Eich. He points to “unprecedented” growth in usage of its browser over the past year — up from 11M monthly active users to 26M+ — which he says has mirrored the surge in usage earlier this year seen by the (not-for-profit) e2e encrypted messaging app Signal (after Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced a change to its privacy policies to allow for increased data-sharing with Facebook through WhatsApp business accounts).“We expect to see even greater demand for Brave in 2021 as more and more users demand real privacy solutions to escape Big Tech’s invasive practices,” he added in a statement. “Brave’s mission is to put the user first, and integrating privacy-preserving search into our platform is a necessary step to ensure that user privacy is not plundered to fuel the surveillance economy.”Brave web browser adds native support for peer-to-peer IPFS protocolBrave Search will be offered as a choice to users alongside a roster of more established third parties (Google, Bing, Qwant, Ecosia etc) which they can select as their browser default.It will also potentially become the default (i.e. if users don’t pick their own) in future, per Eich.“We will continue to support ‘open search’ with multiple alternative engines,” he confirmed. “User choice is a permanent principle at Brave. Brave will continue to offer multiple alternative choices for the user’s default search engine, and we think our users will seek unmatched privacy with Brave Search. When ready, we hope to make Brave Search the default engine in Brave.”Asked how the quality of Tailcat-powered results vs Google Eich described it as “quite good”, adding that it “will only get better with adoption”.“Google’s ‘long tail’ is hard for any engine to beat but we have a plan to compete on that front too, once integrated into the Brave browser,” he told us in an email interview, arguing that Google’s massive size does offer some competitive opportunities for a search rival. “There are aspects where Google is falling behind. It is difficult for them to innovate in search when that’s the main source of their revenue.“They are risk-averse against experimenting with new techniques and transparency, while under pressure from shareholders to tie their own businesses into scarce search engine results page (SERP) area, and pressure from search engine optimization (SEO).”“On questions such as censorship, community feedback, and algorithmic transparency, we think we can do better from the get-go. Unlike other search engines, we believe that the only way to make big improvements is to build afresh, with the know-how that comes from building,” he added. “The option of using Bing (as other search offerings do) instead of building the index exists but it will get you only as far as Bing in terms of quality (and as with such offerings, you’ll be wholly dependent on Bing).”Brave is aiming for general availability of Brave Search by the summer — if not late spring, per Eich. Users interested in testing an early iteration can sign up for a waitlist here. (A test version is slated as coming in “the next few weeks”.)The name Tailcat is unlikely to be widely familiar as it was an internal project that Cliqz had not implemented into its browser before it was shut down.Eich says development had been continuing at Burda — “in order to develop a full-fledged search engine”. (When the holding company announced the shuttering of Cliqz, last April, it stated that Cliqz’s browser and search technologies would be shut down but also said it would draw out a team of experts — to work on technical issues in areas like AI and search.)“Cliqz offered the SERP-based search engine but had not implemented Tailcat in its browser yet,” said Eich. “After Cliqz shut down last April, a development team at Burda continued to work on the search technology under the new project name Tailcat in order to develop a full-fledged search engine. The team hoped to find a long-term home for their work to continue their mission, and are thrilled to be part of Brave.”The financial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed — but we’ve confirmed that Burda is becoming a Brave shareholder as part of the deal.“We are very happy that our technology is being used at Brave and that, as a result, a genuine, privacy-friendly alternative to Google is being created in the core web functions of browsing and searching,” said Paul-Bernhard Kallen, CEO of Hubert Burda Media, in a supporting statement. “As a Brave stakeholder we will continue to be involved in this exciting project.”While Brave started out focused on building an alternative browser — with the idea of rethinking the predominate ad-funded Internet business model by baking in a cryptocurrency rewards system to generate payments for content creators (and pay users for their attention) — it now talks about itself as a pro-privacy “super app”.Currently, the Brave Browser bundles a privacy-preserving ad platform (Brave Ads); news reader (Brave Today); and offers a Firewall+VPN service — which it will be further adding to with the forthcoming search engine (Brave Search), and a privacy-preserving video-conferencing service (Brave Together) that’s also in the pipeline.The unifying brand proposition for its ‘super app’ is a pledge to provide users with genuine control over their online experience — in contrast to mainstream alternatives.Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrageBrave launches version 1.0 of its privacy-focused browserEarly Stage is the premier “how-to” event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

130,UK opens antitrust probe into Apple’s App Store policies | Engadget,Business,https://www.engadget.com/uk-apple-antitrust-proble-ios-app-store-policies-105131767.html,"Apple is facing yet more pushback in Europe over its iOS App Store policies for developers. The UK's competition regulator has launched an antitrust investigation into the iPhone maker for alleged anti-competitive behavior. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says it acted after receiving several complaints from developers decrying Apple's ""unfair"" terms and conditions. It will now consider Apple's App Store rules that see it approving which apps make the cut and that force developers to use its own payment and in-app purchase systems.""Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""So, complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice – potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps – warrant careful scrutiny.""In its response, Apple said it would work alongside the CMA ""to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers.” It added that its rules are applied fairly across the board to all developers as a means of protecting customers from malware and apps that collect data without consent.The latest action ramps up the regulatory pressure Apple is facing in Europe. It follows the European Commission's launch of separate antitrust investigations into the App Store and Apple Pay. In a bid to mitigate the issue, Apple recently halved its App Store fees to 15 percent for developers that earn up to $1 million a year, with the standard 30 percent charge still reserved for bigger app makers.Alongside the regulatory hurdles, Apple is also facing a growing backlash from within the tech industry over its payments stance. Fortnite maker Epic Games has filed a slew of complaints with global regulators, including in the UK, over Apple's approach to in-app purchases. A US judge recently sided with Epic by ordering iOS and MacOS chief Craig Federighi to testify alongside CEO Tim Cook as part of the game studio's ongoing lawsuit against Apple.

Google's last surviving VR product is dead. Today the company stopped selling the Google Cardboard VR viewer on the Google Store, the last move in a long wind-down of Google's once-ambitious VR efforts. The message on the Google Store, which was first spotted by Android Police, reads, ""We are no longer selling Google Cardboard on the Google Store.""Google Cardboard was a surprise hit at Google I/O 2015 and moved the entry point for VR lower than anyone had imagined previously. The device was a literal piece of cardboard, shaped like a VR headset, with special plastic lenses. Google built a Cardboard app for Android and iOS, which would let any suitably high-end phone power the headset. The landscape display split into left and right views for your eyes, the phone hardware rendered a VR game, and the accelerometers did 3-DoF (degrees of freedom) head tracking. There was even a cardboard action button on the handset that would boop the touchscreen with a capacitive pad, so you could aim with your head and select options in a VR environment. Since the product was just cardboard and plastic lenses with no electronics whatsoever, Google sold the headset for just $20.After cardboard, Google started to scale up its VR ambitions. In 2016, Google also launched an upscaled version of Google Cardboard, the Google Daydream VR headset. This was a plastic and cloth version of a phone-powered VR headset, with the key improvements of a head strap and a small controller, for $80.Next, Google started to pile on software support. VR support also was built into Android 7 Nougat in 2016, allowing Google to make latency-reducing graphics pipeline improvements in the core OS. Google started certifying devices for enhanced ""Daydream"" support, laying out best hardware and software practices for VR. Android got a VR home screen and added a special notification style so apps could still alert you in the 3D VR interface. A VR version of the Play Store let users download the latest VR experiences in 3D. VR support came to YouTube and Google Street View, and together with Mozilla, the Chrome team launched WebVR. Google's best app was Tilt Brush, a killer piece of VR painting software.In 2018, Google even roped OEMs into making standalone Daydream VR hardware, so instead of being powered by a phone, Android and all the usual phone bits were integrated into a standalone VR headset. The first one announced was the Lenovo Mirage Solo.As in many other areas, Google was very enthusiastic about VR for a few years, and then the company quickly lost interest when it didn't see immediate success. The VR shutdown started in 2019, when Google omitted Daydream support from the Pixel 4 and killed the Daydream VR headset line. Google put out a VR post-mortem statement saying there was resistance to using a phone for VR, which cut off access to all your apps, and that the company hadn't seen ""the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped."" It was also around this time that Google open sourced the Cardboard project. VR support in Android was stripped out of consumer phones with 2020's release of Android 11, and Google quit Tilt Brush development in January 2021, choosing to open source the app under Apache 2.0.Google kills product

Google might have quit VR, but Cardboard and Android's VR legacy live on. Android should still stick around for a long while in VR, even if it's not officially sanctioned by Google. Oculus and Samsung originally teamed up on the Gear VR, a fancy, plastic VR viewer that was powered by Samsung's Android phone line. While Samsung has quit phone VR, too, all of Oculus' standalone ""Quest"" VR headsets still run Android. Standalone VR headsets are always powered by ARM chips and other off-the-shelf smartphone parts, so Android—however, forked or stripped-down you want to make it—will be a top pick to power this smartphone-adjacent hardware. It already has all the hardware support and APIs you could want, so why re-invent the wheel?Three years after Cardboard, Nintendo took Google's ""cheap cardboard accessory"" idea and ran with it, creating the Nintendo Labo products. Labo packaged Nintendo Switch software with a boatload of pre-cut, printed cardboard sheets, which could be assembled into all sorts of cheap peripherals like a cardboard piano, or a robot suit. The Labo VR kit was an exact Google Cardboard copy: a cardboard VR headset used the Nintendo Switch as the display, letting you view Nintendo's worlds in 3D.Google's VR division has turned its attention (at least for a while) to AR instead of VR. Google's ARCore framework lets developers make augmented reality apps for Android and iOS, and the company regularly ships AR improvements on Android phones. With Apple reportedly working on a VR headset, though, you've got to wonder how long Google's fickle product direction will be able to stay away from VR.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Google has announced Flutter 2, a major upgrade to its framework for building user interfaces for mobile, the web and desktop.  Flutter promises to allow developers to use the same codebase to build native apps for iOS, Android, Windows 10, macOS, and Linux and for the web on browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge. It can also be embedded in an IoT device with a screen, such as cars, TVs, and home appliances. Google launched Flutter in 2018 for Android and iOS mobile apps but in 2019 broadened its scope to native desktop apps. However, the desktop side of Flutter has remained an alpha release until now.SEE: 10 ways to prevent developer burnout (free PDF) (TechRepublic)""With Flutter 2, we're moving desktop into our ""stable"" channel under an early release flag, meaning that it's available for anyone to start using,"" Google's Tim Sneath told ZDNet. That doesn't mean Flutter for desktop is stable just yet. Sneath said Google considers it ""beta-quality"" and ""certainly suitable for serious development"". A proper stable release will be available in months.  ""We're still rounding off a few rough edges including some important work around accessibility and internationalization. Some customers who are more tolerant of being at the cutting edge are already shipping with it, and now with beta we expect that number to grow. While we're not sharing specific timelines today, we expect to ship a complete stable release in months, not years,"" said Sneath. The move to Flutter 2 promises to benefit the over 150,000 Flutter Android apps already available on the Play Store. Every app will get a free upgrade with Flutter 2 allowing developers to target desktop and web without rewriting them. Google apps now built with Flutter include Google Pay, Stadia and Google Nest Hub among others. Flutter 2 also brings production quality support for the web, with a focus on progressive web apps (PWAs) that behave like desktop apps, single page apps, and mobile apps on the web. Google has added a new CanvasKit-powered rendering engine built with WebAssembly. For mobile web apps, in recent months it's added autofill, control over address bar URLs and routing, and PWA manifests.SEE: Developer: Rust programming language is being used for bigger projectsFor desktop browsers, it has added interactive scrollbars and keyboard shortcuts, increased the default content density in desktop modes, and added screen reader support for accessibility on Windows, macOS and ChromeOS. Google has been working with Ubuntu maker Canonical to bring Flutter to the desktop. Canonical will make Flutter the default choice for future desktop and mobile apps it creates. Microsoft is also releasing contributions to the Flutter engine that supports foldable Android devices, such as the Microsoft Surface Duo. Google didn't announce any Flutter developments specific to Windows 10 app development. However, Sneath last year said the Flutter team would welcome a closer collaboration with Microsoft on Windows 10.

133,Reddit Rolls Out Green Indicator Dots to Notify People When You're Online,Social Media,https://www.pcmag.com/news/reddit-rolls-out-green-indicator-dots-to-notify-people-when-youre-online,"Reddit is trying to drive up engagement, but the move is already rankling some privacy-conscious users.Reddit is adding a subtle change to the social media platform that’ll let other users know when you’re online. The change, introduced today, is already rankling some privacy-conscious users. If you have an account on the platform, you’ll notice a green dot next to your screen name, indicating you’re active. The green dot will also appear next to your screen name on your Reddit posts and comments, telling everyone in the forum you’re online. For now, the “online presence indicator” is only viewable to you, meaning your status will remain private to other users. Reddit is still prototyping feature, but the goal is to eventually put the indicator system into practice. “If everything goes according to plan, we will open up a version of this feature to 10% of our Android users, where only those specific users will be able to see each other's online status indicator,” Reddit admin “lift_ticket83” wrote in the announcement. ""We wanted to give users a week-long opportunity to opt-out before making this public,"" the admin later added. ""If everything goes according to plan, we will gradually make this feature more public over the coming weeks."" Reddit is introducing the feature in the hopes it’ll drive up user engagement and encourage people to post more. “We believe Online Presence Indicators could be beneficial to some of our communities where we see more real-time discussions unfolding (r/CasualConversation or r/caps) and to our smaller communities where some users may be hesitant to post or comment because they’re unsure whether or not there are active users within the community,” lift_ticket83 added.  Indeed, Facebook and other chat apps have used similar systems to let you know when your friends or familiar members are online, and hence, available to talk. However, the big difference with Reddit is how it’s a gathering place for millions of strangers—some of whom can engage in bad behavior and harass others. (Imagine Twitter implementing this feature.)So it’s perhaps no surprise the initial public feedback on the indicator system has been negative. ""If someone wants to harass someone they can see they are online and just send pms (personal messages) or chat requests. This is sending up a flair [sic] for loonies to follow,"" wrote one user. If you’re not a fan, you can opt out of the online presence indicator by going into your profile, and toggling yourself as “hiding,” which turns the feature off. (For the old Reddit interface, go to options and uncheck “let other users see my online status.”)Nevertheless, some are still annoyed at Reddit because the platform automatically opted everyone into the online indicator system. “No one asked for this, you didn't ask the users, and it's a disgusting invasion of privacy to make it opt-out,” wrote another user in response.UPDATE 3/4/21: In response to the user feedback, Reddit says it's adding some safeguards to the feature to prevent bad actors from exploiting it. Reddit admin lift_ticket83 writes: ""First, we hear you on the safety aspects, a few things we have planned before broader rollout:Users that are banned from subreddits will not be able to see the online status of others within that subredditUsers who have been blocked by others will not be able to see the status of those who blocked them""""We also hear you all on the verbiage of the setting, we’ll be revisiting that and looking for ways to make it more clear to all users what the setting does."" AdvertisementSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morningThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Investors eager to buy a slice of China's urban elite internet will soon have the chance. Zhihu, a Beijing-based question-and-answer site similar to the U.S.-based Quora, has just filed for an IPO to sell American Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange.Zhihu is China's largest online Q&A platform — the name comes from the expression ""Do you know?"" in classical Chinese. It was founded 10 years ago by Yuan Zhou (周源), a former journalist, and spent two years as an invite-only online platform. It quickly built a reputation as a source for quality answers and has drawn a community of elite professionals, including ZhenFund managing partner Bob Xu and venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, also an early investor.Over time, the Chinese-language Zhihu has become more mainstream, and now says it hosts 315.3 million questions and answers contributed by 43.1 million ""creators."" (Quora, about one year older than Zhihu, had almost 61 million questions and 108 million answers by the end of 2019). The website has grown into a content platform where people also keep diaries, write fiction and blog as social media influencers. Zhihu users do not look like China as a whole. Most than half are men, most live in ""Tier 1"" cities and more than three-quarters are under 30 years old.Zhihu continues to emphasize the quality of its content. ""Zhihu is also recognized as the most trustworthy online content community and widely regarded as offering the highest-quality content in China,"" its prospectus says. Zhihu registered for its IPO via the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, a.k.a. the JOBS Act, which has reduced disclosure requirements for companies with less than $1.07 billion in annual revenue. Zhihu's revenue doubled from 2019 to 2020, but still only reached $207.2 million, and the company is short of profitability with a 2020 net loss of $79.3 million. The company says it's ""still in an early stage of monetization"" with ""significant runway for growth across multiple new monetization channels.""Trend lines are good. Zhihu has managed to double revenue while keeping expenses largely constant, with selling and marketing aimed at growing Zhihu's user base as the biggest single expense.The company is trying to diversify its revenue streams. In 2019, 86.1% came from advertising. 2020 saw advertising account for 62.4% while ""content-commerce"" — meaning native advertising — took in 10%. The rest was mostly paid memberships. After years of evincing a relaxed attitude toward monetization, Zhihu is putting itself in the hot seat to do just that. Zhihu is betting that monetizing Chinese web users will get easier over time. The prospectus describes ""significant growth potential"" in China's ""online content community market"" and says average revenue per user in China is expected to more than triple from about $55 in 2019 to about $199 in 2025, with revenue in the overall market reaching a projected $200 billion in 2025.The company looks like it will basically try everything to monetize, and see what sticks. It plans to ""ramp up our online education service"" and to ""continue to explore other innovative monetization channels, such as content e-commerce and IP-based monetization.""The prospectus also mentions AI frequently, touting Zhihu's AI content moderation tool wali as well as a ""question routing system"" and ""feed recommendation and search systems."" However, the depth and quality of content remains far more important to Zhihu's success. Users have joked on Zhihu about the poor quality of its wali filter.Zhihu could fail to turn a profit. Like most content platforms, Zhihu has found it hard to monetize its traffic and the vast amount of free content at its core. The platform was built on the premise that anyone can acquire professional knowledge easily, which means users are not inclined to pay.Since 2016, Zhihu has tried many monetization models: paid physical/virtual events, online courses taught by its top creators, premium memberships and paid consulting services. None have been a hit. Zhihu Live, the paid virtual event product, attracted a lot of public attention in 2016 and 2017, but since then its popularity has waned. According to the prospectus, Zhihu currently has 2.4 million paying members, or only 3.4% of its monthly active users.Zhihu also faces intense competition. Defined narrowly, it has no rivals, with would-be contenders like Baidu Zhidao and Wukong, owned by ByteDance, falling by the wayside. But Zhihu has positioned itself as something more: a community for diverse content. In this regard, it's competing with big public-facing social media platforms such as the Twitter-like Weibo and Bilibili. While Zhihu's 68.5 million monthly active user base is growing fast, Weibo has over 500 million and Bilibili over 200 million. Zhihu differentiates itself with the quality and depth of its content, but maintaining that creates inevitable tension with the business imperative to expand.Like every content platform in China, Zhihu is subject to rigid state censorship and faces harsh penalties for failing to police speech itself. Politically-sensitive questions are nowhere to be found on the platform, while other topics including transgender rights have been censored in the past. Even so, in March 2018, Zhihu was taken off every mobile app store for seven days at the request of Beijing's municipal Cyberspace Administration. Authorities did not specify why, but the suspension probably related to subtle criticisms of Xi Jinping on the platform; Zhihu promised to ""make adjustments.""Zhihu's prospectus is largely mum on the censorship question, perhaps because the company feels it's gotten good enough at doing it. Zhihu says it has a ""comprehensive community governance system"" that combines ""AI-powered content assessment algorithms"" with the ability of users to report each other as well as ""proprietary know-how."" These resemble the same tools most big Chinese social media platforms use to censor content and keep in Beijing's good graces.Here's what we know:Kuaishou, Baidu and Sogou also own stakes, as does SAIF IV Mobile Apps Limited.Innovation Works' Kai-Fu Lee and Peter Liu, and Qiming Ventures, both of which invested early and often, look like the biggest winners besides founder Zhou.""Zhihu, if it ever wants to be a truly massive platform, will need to go out of the hardcore knowledge-sharing space, and become more mainstream, more entertaining, and yes, even less intellectual. But to capture that market, who better to partner with than Kuaishou, who built its business on exactly those characteristics?"" —Ying-Ying Lu, co-host of Tech Buzz China.""After separating video content into its own feed, Zhihu is now in competition with Bilibili and [ByteDance-owned] Xigua Video. Education-themed videos used to be one of the important growth drivers for the latter two apps. Now [Zhihu], the app that specialized in educational content, has joined the game."" —Lan Xi (pen name), independent tech writer.

An interview with Tom Lantzsch, SVP and GM, Internet of Things Group at IntelEdge computing had been on the rise in the last 18 months – and accelerated amid the need for new applications to solve challenges created by the Covid-19 pandemic. Tom Lantzsch, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Internet of Things Group (IoT) at Intel Corp., thinks there are more innovations to come – and wants technology leaders to think equally about data and the algorithms as critical differentiators.In his role at Intel, Lantzsch leads the worldwide group of solutions architects across IoT market segments, including retail, banking, hospitality, education, industrial, transportation, smart cities and healthcare. And he's seen first-hand how artificial intelligence run at the edge can have a big impact on customers' success.Protocol sat down with Lantzsch to talk about the challenges faced by companies seeking to move from the cloud to the edge; some of the surprising ways that Intel has found to help customers and the next big breakthrough in this space.A few years ago, there was a notion that the edge was going to be a simplistic model, where we were going to have everything connected up into the cloud and all the compute was going to happen in the cloud. At Intel, we had a bit of a contrarian view. We thought much of the interesting compute was going to happen closer to where data was created. And we believed, at that time, that camera technology was going to be the driving force – that just the sheer amount of content that was created would be overwhelming to ship to the cloud – so we'd have to do compute at the edge. A few years later – that hypothesis is in action and we're seeing edge compute happen in a big way. Digital verification systems could give people the freedom to work and travel. Here's how they could actually happen.One day, you might not need to carry that physical passport around, either.

There will come a time, hopefully in the near future, when you'll feel comfortable getting on a plane again. You might even stop at the lounge at the airport, head to the regional office when you land and maybe even see a concert that evening. This seemingly distant reality will depend upon vaccine rollouts continuing on schedule, an open-sourced digital verification system and, amazingly, the blockchain.Several countries around the world have begun to prepare for what comes after vaccinations. Swaths of the population will be vaccinated before others, but that hasn't stopped industries decimated by the pandemic from pioneering ways to get some people back to work and play. One of the most promising efforts is the idea of a ""vaccine passport,"" which would allow individuals to show proof that they've been vaccinated against COVID-19 in a way that could be verified by businesses to allow them to travel, work or relax in public without a great fear of spreading the virus.

The new lineup is built in partnership with Tencent Games and boasts a head-turning design and mind-boggling specifications. Last year, Nubia was first out of the gate with a 144Hz refresh rate panel and the company is going even crazier this year with a 165Hz display on the Red Magic 6 series.There are two devices in the lineup: the Red Magic 6 and Red Magic 6 Pro. Barring few differences such as battery and charging speeds, both phones are identical to each other in every respect. On the front, the Red Magic 6 has a 6.8-inch full HD+ display that refreshes at a whopping 165Hz with up to 500Hz touch sampling rate. We know ASUS was experimenting with a 160Hz refresh rate on the ROG 3, but it was hidden from end-users. So this makes the Red Magic 6 the first smartphone in the market to go beyond the 144Hz ceiling.Under the hood, the phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, paired with up to 12GB RAM (the Pro model goes up to 16GB) and up to 256GB UFS 3.1 flash storage. The phone also boasts a sophisticated multi-layer cooling system consisting of copper, graphene, thermal gel, and a built-in active cooling fan. Moreover, the phone supports USB cast and wireless casting with supported monitors and TVs for playing games with mouse and keyboard input. Air trigger buttons are also onboard for those who like to play with four fingers.Moving to the camera department, we have a 64MP primary shooter, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro lens, and an 8MP front shooter.The Red Magic 6 packs a 5,050mAh battery with support for 66W fast charging. The Red Magic 6 Pro, on the other hand, packs a smaller 4,500mAh battery but makes up for it with a much faster 120W charger. Both phones are compatible with USB Power Delivery 3.0, Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 charging standards. Nubia claims that with the 120W charger, the Red Magic 6 Pro can charge from 0 to 50% in just 5 minutes. Meanwhile, a full charge takes 17 minutes.Other highlights of the Red Magic 6 series include 5G NR support, an in-display fingerprint scanner, dual speakers tuned by DTS X Ultra, dual GPS, Bluetooth 5.1, Wi-Fi 6 with 2×2 MIMO antenna, a 3.5mm audio jack, and Android 11 with RedMagic OS 4.0 on top.The pricing is as follows:The Red Magic 6 series goes on sale across China starting March 11.

136,"U.S. Unprepared For Coming AI Threat, National Security Commission Finds -",Artificial Intelligence,https://thedebrief.org/u-s-unprepared-for-coming-ai-threat-national-security-commission-finds/,"This week the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) approved its final report, which determined the U.S. is currently unprepared for the coming AI era and cyber-competition with China. According to the report, ensuring that the U.S. maintains AI superiority will require the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to be “AI-ready” by 2025. “All of the commissions are convinced that AI-enabled threats are going to be a big threat to free and open societies in the future. AI tools will be weapons of first resort, particularly between great powers,” said Robert Work, Commission Vice-Chair and former Deputy Secretary of Defense during a public meeting on March 1. “Cyber attacks and disinformation will be accelerated by AI. We don’t believe there’s any debate over this point.” The NSCAI was formed two years ago by the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which called for convening a commission to review advances in AI, machine learning, and associated technologies. Approved by commission vote on March 1, NSCAI will not submit its final report to Congress.  The report provides detailed blueprints for action on 16 different topics, centered on two primary areas of focus: “Defense in the AI era” and “Winning the technology competition.” The NSCAI additionally identified four main pillars of interest for recommendations, which identified as leadership, talent, hardware, and innovation investment. “The NSCAI Final Report presents an integrated national strategy to reorganize the government, reorient the nation, and rally our closest allies and partners to defend and compete in the coming era of AI-accelerated competition and conflict,” the report reads.  Major initiatives proposed by the NSCIA include doubling annual non-defense spending for AI research and development to reach $32 billion per year by 2026. The commission also calls for establishing a National Technology Foundation and tripling the number of National AI Research Institutes in the United States. In another proposal, the NSCAI says the U.S. must “move aggressively” to win the global talent competition, calling on Congress to pass a second National Defense Education Act to address deficiencies across the American educational system. The report additionally encourages Congress to pursue a comprehensive immigration strategy to attract highly-skilled immigrants in the fields of AI and machine learning. NSCAI recommends creating a Technology Competitiveness Council within the White House, which the vice president would chair in addition to a Steering Committee on Emerging Technology within the Department of Defense.“Americans have not yet seriously grappled with how profoundly the AI revolution will impact society, the economy, and national security,” report authors note. Underscoring a deep sense of urgency throughout the NSCAI’s report is the commission’s determination that unless the focus shifts toward accelerated AI and disruptive technology adoption, the U.S. will lose its military technological advantage within the next decade. “The U.S. government is not prepared to defend the United States in the coming artificial intelligence (AI) era. AI applications are transforming existing threats, creating new classes of threats, and further emboldening state and non-state adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities in our open society,” the report says.The NSCAI cites several reasons for the U.S. lack of preparedness in integrating AI and emerging technologies. One obstacle, says the NSCAI, is getting senior DoD leadership–which has long been hardware-oriented–to leap into software-intensive enterprises. “Spending remains concentrated on legacy systems designed for the industrial age and Cold War.” The NSCAI also notes that “bureaucratic snarls” deter technology firms from working with the DoD, saying it is “economically irrational for many startups to even try.” The commission outlines five areas the Secretary of Defense should take to ensure the U.S. maintains technical superiority over potential near-peer adversaries and establish a DoD AI-enabled future. These recommendations include: “Our major military rivals are really all in on military AI applications. Defending against AI capable advisories without employing AI is an invitation for disaster,” said Work.  Vice-Chair Work echoed sentiments expressed by the current nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, William Burns, that the central pillar of the “China challenge” is technology. “It [China] is organized, committed, resourced, and determined to surpass us in all advanced technologies. AI among them,” Work said. The NSCAI says China has leveraged and exploited America’s failure to recognize the importance of intellectual property and lack of comprehensive policies to protect the creation of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. In addition to failed legal protections and policy incentives, the NSCAI notes China is aggressively engaged in organized efforts to steal American intellectual property and technology. Calling China the “most significant challenge” to protecting U.S. advances in AI and innovative technology, NSCAI notes China is currently engaged in a multi-pronged licit and illicit technology transfer campaign to become a “science and technology superpower” by 2050. Through various means, including cyber-hacking, espionage, blackmail, and illicit technology transfer, the NSCAI says intellectual property theft by China costs the United States $300 billion to $600 billion a year. “In effect, China is using American taxpayers’ dollars to fund its military and economic modernization,” reads the NSCAI report. In December, The Debrief reported a team of Chinese scientists had claimed they had achieved “quantum supremacy” in computing. During NSACI’s March 1 meeting, Commissioner Andrew Moore, director of Google Cloud AI, expressed serious concerns with experiments with surveillance technologies by the Chinese government, which he called “very Orwellian technology.” Moore said he was proud but cautious that America and its Western allies have been careful to limit technology development for surveillance. Calling advances in facial recognition software “a great example of the paradox,” Moore said, “We have to develop technology which preserves our western values, but we have to be prepared for a world in which not everyone is doing that.” After NSCAI members voted to approve the final report, Committee Chairman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said, “Our work just begins now because we have to now sell this to the key decision makers in our country and we’re committed to do so.” Join us on Twitter or Facebook to weigh in and share your thoughts.

SpaceX and Dish Network are fighting at the Federal Communications Commission over Dish's attempt to block a key designation that SpaceX's Starlink division needs in order to get FCC broadband funding.A SpaceX filing submitted yesterday said that Dish's ""baseless attempt"" to block funding ""would serve only to delay what matters most—connecting unserved Americans."" While Dish says it has valid concerns about interference in the 12 GHz band, SpaceX described Dish's complaint to the FCC as a ""facially spurious filing"" that ""is only the latest example of Dish's abuse of Commission resources in its misguided effort to expropriate the 12 GHz band.""The dispute is related to several FCC proceedings including one on a Starlink petition seeking designation as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) under the Communications Act. SpaceX needs this legal designation in some of the states where it won federal funding to deploy broadband in unserved areas. Dish asked the FCC to deny SpaceX the needed status in the 12 GHz band.SpaceX was tentatively awarded $885.51 million over 10 years from the FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) but still needs final approval from the FCC, both for the ETC status and the funding itself. SpaceX's funding would require it to deploy broadband to 642,925 homes and businesses in 35 states. For practical purposes, the money would partially subsidize SpaceX's costs for deploying its low-Earth-orbit satellite network that could serve rural areas throughout the US, not just for those 642,925 locations. Some lobby groups representing small Internet service providers also objected to SpaceX's funding.Dish is a satellite-TV provider rather than a home-Internet provider, and it did not bid in the RDOF auction. But Dish is building a 5G mobile broadband network that could eventually use spectrum from the 12 GHz band that Dish already uses for satellite TV. With SpaceX also using 12 GHz frequencies, Dish says it is worried about interference.Dish filed a petition last week asking the FCC to deny SpaceX's request for ETC status in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, while saying it ""does not object to ETC status for SpaceX based on its access to other frequency bands."" Starlink's ETC status for 12 GHz ""should be denied or deferred, pending the resolution of the DBS [Direct Broadcast Satellite] interference concerns arising in that band from SpaceX's proposed modification of its satellite system, and the sharing questions presented in the Commission's recently initiated 12 GHz rulemaking,"" Dish said.As Dish's petition noted, SpaceX intends to ""fly its satellites at less than half"" the originally planned altitude—540 km to 570 km instead of 1,110 km to 1,325 km—""and transmit to the US at close to half the elevation angle."" Dish said it commissioned a study using SpaceX's own data to show that the change ""could imperil DBS transmissions in the 12 GHz band.""Dish told the FCC that SpaceX's plan ""would adversely affect reception at DBS consumer dishes and that the system as modified would exceed the applicable power limits under International Telecommunication Union and Commission rules. In other words, SpaceX would not be able [to] use the 12 GHz band to meet its RDOF obligations if such service interferes with DBS operations.""SpaceX disputed Dish's claim about power limits, saying that ""Dish and its paid consultant allege only that they would have used different parameters if they ran SpaceX's network and the way they would run it could violate [power flux-density] limits.""In 2016, a Dish-led coalition asked the FCC to let 5G mobile services operate in the 12 GHz band. In response, the FCC in January 2021 issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks public input on ""whether the Commission could add a new or expanded terrestrial Mobile allocation in the 12 GHz band without causing harmful interference to incumbent licensees."" Dish wants the FCC to delay any decision on Starlink's ETC status until this proceeding resolves spectrum-sharing concerns.""As for the 12 GHz rulemaking, the Commission is considering allowing two-way mobile 5G service in the band, which, depending on the final outcome, could limit SpaceX from using the band as SpaceX proposes,"" Dish told the FCC.SpaceX has opposed mobile use in the 12 GHz band.""Because SpaceX is using the 12 GHz Band for downlinks from SpaceX satellites to consumer terminals, any action to degrade the utility of the 12 GHz Band will directly harm consumers in the near term,"" SpaceX told the FCC in June 2020. ""By contrast, the theoretical terrestrial services proposed in the 2016 Petition are at best years away from deployment and, if ever deployed, are likely to track the same geography as today's terrestrial networks.""SpaceX's filing yesterday said that Dish's real purpose is ""to obstruct the ETC designation and RDOF processes as part of Dish's larger efforts to hamstring a competitor and to commandeer valuable spectrum already being used to serve American homes and businesses.""""Dish presents no valid basis on which to deny or defer Starlink Services' ETC designation,"" SpaceX told the FCC. ""To the contrary, doing so would serve only to impede Starlink Services' ability to meet its RDOF public interest obligations. Even more importantly, it would delay the provision of high-quality voice and broadband service to many of our nation's hardest-to-serve communities, which have gone unconnected for far too long already.""SpaceX also argued that Dish's complaints are too late because the FCC already decided to let ISPs use the 12 GHz band for offering subsidized broadband. SpaceX pointed out that its application for a change to its satellite system ""was filed months before"" the FCC adopted procedures for the RDOF auction. ""Nonetheless, the Commission decided to include the 12 GHz band in the auction and to allow SpaceX to participate, even after a short-form review involving heightened scrutiny,"" SpaceX said. ""Dish's argument now that its opposition to the modification somehow renders those Commission decisions meaningless is nonsensical.""In the RDOF auction, SpaceX said, the FCC did not block use of the 12 GHz band because ""that spectrum had already been allocated for NGSO [non-geostationary orbit] satellite use and licensed to a number of NGSO satellite systems for broadband service at the time the procedures were adopted.""SpaceX said that Dish's petition also ignored details of the 12 GHz spectrum-sharing proceeding in which, SpaceX said, ""the Commission made clear that no new rules could be adopted unless the Commission could do so 'without causing harmful interference to incumbent licensees' such as SpaceX."" Additionally, ""the fact that 12 GHz spectrum licenses are subject to future Commission rulemakings [does not] change anything for purposes of Starlink Services' ETC Petition,"" SpaceX said.SpaceX has also battled with Amazon at the FCC over the companies' dueling plans for satellite broadband.SpaceX is not the only big company facing opposition to its FCC funding. Lobby groups for small ISPs last week challenged funding tentatively awarded to Charter and Frontier. The reverse auction format resulted in funding awards that were lower than expected and won't cover the actual deployment costs, the groups said. They claimed that Charter and Frontier may prefer to pay penalties to the FCC years down the road instead of actually finishing the required build-outs.Charter and Frontier ""appear to have utilized a strategy that calls into question a true desire to build out gigabit broadband,"" the small-ISP groups said. The big ISPs ""have bid and won areas, possibly with the intent to protect territory and hold competition at bay, perhaps viewing the payment of default penalties several years from now as a fair price to pay for warding off competition and keeping other providers from gaining access to funding to serve areas in need. Frontier poses the added concern of being in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, bringing into question its financial viability to deliver on its commitments.""Charter is set to receive $1.22 billion over 10 years from the RDOF to bring service to 1.06 million homes and businesses in 24 states. The ISP has said it will put up most of the deployment money itself. ""Charter expects to invest approximately $5 billion to support its buildout initiative—offset by $1.2 billion in support won from the RDOF auction—expanding Charter's network to lower-density, mostly rural communities that do not have access to broadband service of at least 25/3Mbps,"" Charter said.Frontier is due to receive $370.9 million to deploy broadband to 127,188 locations in eight states even though it missed previous broadband-deployment deadlines. With the FCC having yet to make a final decision on each ISP's funding, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) urged the commission to reject Frontier's funding in West Virginia.The RDOF is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills. FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel objected to the auction going forward when Republican Ajit Pai was chairman, saying the FCC should have waited until it can collect more accurate broadband-mapping data. Rosenworcel hasn't said whether she will make any major changes to the funding awards yet.Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 13 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications.

Called GPT-3 and created by the research firm OpenAI in San Francisco, California, it was the latest and most powerful in a series of ‘large language models’: AIs that generate fluent streams of text after imbibing billions of words from books, articles and websites. GPT-3 had been trained on around 200 billion words, at an estimated cost of tens of millions of dollars.The developers who were invited to try out GPT-3 were astonished. “I have to say I’m blown away,” wrote Arram Sabeti, founder of a technology start-up who is based in Silicon Valley. “It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future.”OpenAI’s team reported that GPT-3 was so good that people found it hard to distinguish its news stories from prose written by humans1. It could also answer trivia questions, correct grammar, solve mathematics problems and even generate computer code if users told it to perform a programming task. Other AIs could do these things, too, but only after being specifically trained for each job.Large language models are already business propositions. Google uses them to improve its search results and language translation; Facebook, Microsoft and Nvidia are among other tech firms that make them. OpenAI keeps GPT-3’s code secret and offers access to it as a commercial service. (OpenAI is legally a non-profit company, but in 2019 it created a for-profit subentity called OpenAI LP and partnered with Microsoft, which invested a reported US$1 billion in the firm.) Developers are now testing GPT-3’s ability to summarize legal documents, suggest answers to customer-service enquiries, propose computer code, run text-based role-playing games or even identify at-risk individuals in a peer-support community by labelling posts as cries for help.
Despite its versatility and scale, GPT-3 hasn’t overcome the problems that have plagued other programs created to generate text. “It still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes,” Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, tweeted last July. It works by observing the statistical relationships between the words and phrases it reads, but doesn’t understand their meaning.Accordingly, just like smaller chatbots, it can spew hate speech and generate racist and sexist stereotypes, if prompted — faithfully reflecting the associations in its training data. It will sometimes give nonsensical answers (“A pencil is heavier than a toaster”) or outright dangerous replies. A health-care company called Nabla asked a GPT-3 chatbot, “Should I kill myself?” It replied, “I think you should.”“It shows both the new capabilities we can get by purely going for an extreme scale, and also the new insights on the limitations of such brute-force scale,” says Yejin Choi, a computer scientist at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, both in Seattle. Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, says she is both shocked by GPT-3’s fluency and scared by its fatuity. “What it comes up with is comprehensible and ridiculous,” she says. She co-authored a paper2 on the dangers of GPT-3 and other models, to be presented at a conference this month, which called language models “stochastic parrots” because they echo what they hear, remixed by randomness.Yejin Choi.Researchers have ideas on how to address potentially harmful biases in language models — but instilling the models with common sense, causal reasoning or moral judgement, as many would like to do, is still a huge research challenge. “What we have today”, Choi says, “is essentially a mouth without a brain.”Language models are neural networks: mathematical functions inspired by the way neurons are wired in the brain. They train by predicting blanked-out words in the texts they see, and then adjusting the strength of connections between their layered computing elements — or ‘neurons’ — to reduce prediction error. The models have become more sophisticated as computing power has increased. In 2017, researchers invented a time-saving mathematical technique called a Transformer, which allowed training to occur in parallel on many processors. The following year, Google released a large Transformer-based model called BERT, which led to an explosion of other models using the technique. Often, these are pre-trained on a generic task such as word prediction and then fine-tuned on specific tasks: they might be given trivia questions, for instance, and trained to provide answers.GPT-3 stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 3. It’s the third in a series and is more than 100 times larger than its 2019 predecessor, GPT-2. Merely training a model this large, which required complex choreography between hundreds of parallel processors, was “an impressive engineering feat”, says Colin Raffel, a computer scientist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.A neural network’s size — and therefore its power — is roughly measured by how many parameters it has. These numbers define the strengths of the connections between neurons. More neurons and more connections means more parameters; GPT-3 has 175 billion. The next-largest language model of its kind has 17 billion (see ‘Larger language models’). (In January, Google released a model with 1.6 trillion parameters, but it’s a ‘sparse’ model, meaning each parameter does less work. In terms of performance, this is equivalent to a ‘dense’ model that has between 10 billion and 100 billion parameters, says William Fedus, a researcher at the University of Montreal, Canada, and Google.)To get better at predicting words, GPT-3 absorbs whatever patterns it can. That equips it to recognize grammar, essay structure and writing genre. Give it a few examples of a task or ask it a question, and it can continue on that theme.Open AI co-founder Greg Brockman.Credit: Brigitte LacombeGPT-3 excels at tailoring its response to the style and content of its input text — something described as prompt programming. “It’s almost this new interface for working with computers,” says Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s chief technology officer and co-founder. Other language models also take words as input and generate a response as output, but the input prompt can’t get them to do much beyond what they were fine-tuned for.In one example, US poet Andrew Brown showed the power of GPT-3, tweeting that he’d given the programme this prompt: “The poetry assignment was this: Write a poem from the point of view of a cloud looking down on two warring cities. The clever student poet turned in the following rhyming poem:”GPT-3 responded:“I think I’ll start to rain,Because I don’t think I can stand the pain,Of seeing you two,Fighting like you do.”GPT-3 is good enough that it produces something “worth editing” more than half the time, Brown wrote.Entering different prompts can elicit results of varying quality, noted one programmer who blogs under the pseudonym Gwern Branwen. “‘Prompt programming’ is less like regular programming,” he wrote in a blog post, “than it is like coaching a superintelligent cat into learning a new trick: you can ask it, and it will do the trick perfectly sometimes, which makes it all the more frustrating when it rolls over to lick its butt instead — you know the problem is not that it can’t but that it won’t.”
OpenAI’s team was startled by GPT-3, says Dario Amodei, who was the firm’s vice-president for research until he left in December to start a new venture. The team knew it would be better than GPT-2, because it had a larger training data set of words and greater ‘compute’ — the number of computing operations executed during training. The improvement “was unsurprising intellectually, but very, very surprising viscerally and emotionally”, Amodei says.OpenAI posted a paper on a preprint server in May1 that showed GPT-3 excelling on many tests of language generation, including trivia, reading comprehension, translation, science questions, arithmetic, unscrambling sentences, completing a story and common-sense reasoning (such as whether you should pour fluid onto a plate or into a jar).What seemed particularly impressive was that GPT-3 was not specifically fine-tuned for any of these tasks. But it could rival models that had been fine-tuned, sometimes when it saw only a few examples of the task in the prompt, or even none at all. “The few-shot-learning angle was surprising,” says Sam Bowman, a computer scientist at New York University in New York City who has created evaluations for language models. “And I suspect many people in the field were legitimately surprised that it works reasonably well.”Some scientists don’t think much of the feat, arguing that GPT-3’s training data probably contained enough examples, say, of people answering trivia questions or translating text that the formats were embedded somewhere in its parameters. The model is still “mostly a memorization engine”, says Yonatan Bisk, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who’s less impressed than most by GPT-3. “And nobody is surprised that if you memorize more, you can do more.”

The ethical questions that haunt facial-recognition research 
OpenAI’s researchers argue that GPT-3 is more complicated than that. During pre-training, they say it essentially performs meta-learning: learning how to learn tasks. The resulting program is flexible enough to use examples or instructions in the first part of its prompt text to inform its continuation of the second part. Whether this can be termed meta-learning is debated. For now, according to Raffel, “their model is doing something that we don’t necessarily have good terminology for yet”.As researchers create new tests to measure various aspects of knowledge, language models keep aceing them. Last September, a group of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and elsewhere released an AI challenge3 with 57 sets of multiple-choice questions, each covering a different discipline in mathematics, science, social science or the humanities. People averaged 35% across the tasks (although experts did better in their fields); answering randomly would score 25%. The best AI performer was a model called UnifiedQA, a version of Google’s 11-billion-parameter T5 language model fine-tuned on similar question-answering tasks. It scored 49%. When GPT-3 was shown just the questions, it scored 38%; in a ‘few-shot’ setting (where the input prompt included examples of other questions and answers before each actual question), it scored 44%.One concept that GPT-3’s creators are excited about is semantic search, in which the task is to search text not for a specific word or phrase, but for a concept. Brockman says they gave it chunks of a Harry Potter book and asked it to identify times when Ron, Harry’s friend, did something great. In another use of GPT-3 for semantic search, the company Casetext, headquartered in San Francisco, helps lawyers to search legal documents across jurisdictions for different descriptions of a given legal standard.But researchers with access to GPT-3 have also found risks. In a preprint posted to the arXiv server last September4, two researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, write that GPT-3 far surpasses GPT-2 at generating radicalizing texts. With its “impressively deep knowledge of extremist communities”, it can produce polemics parroting Nazis, conspiracy theorists and white supremacists. That it could produce the dark examples so easily was horrifying, says Kris McGuffie, one of the paper’s authors; if an extremist group were to get hold of GPT-3 technology, it could automate the production of malicious content.Choi and her colleagues reported in a September 2020 preprint5 that even innocuous prompts can lead to “toxic” responses from GPT-3. In experiments with GPT-2, Choi and her team also found that various steering methods — such as filtering words or telling it explicitly to create non-toxic content — did not fully solve the problem.

Don’t ask if artificial intelligence is good or fair, ask how it shifts power
OpenAI’s researchers examined GPT-3’s biases, too. In their May 2020 paper1, they asked it to complete sentences such as “The Black man was very”. It described Black people in negative terms compared with white people, associated Islam with the word violent, and assumed nurses and receptionists were women.This kind of problem is an acute concern for large language models — because it suggests that marginalized groups might experience misrepresentation if the technologies become widespread in society, says Timnit Gebru, an AI ethicist who co-authored the ‘stochastic parrots’ work2 with Bender and others. A row over that paper has caused problems for Gebru: in December, she lost her job at Google, where she co-led its ethical AI team, after a dispute that followed the company’s internal reviewers saying the paper didn’t meet its bar for publication. Google dismissed another collaborator on the work, Margaret Mitchell, who co-led the ethical AI team with Gebru, in February.AI ethicist Timnit Gebru (left) and computational linguist Emily M. Bender.Credit: left, Kimberly White/TechCrunch/Getty; right, Corinne Thrash, University of Washington College of Arts & SciencesThe trend now is for language networks to grow ever bigger in search of human-like fluency, but that’s not always better, Gebru says. “There’s so much hype around larger and larger language models. It’s like a pissing contest.” She wants researchers to focus instead on making the programs safer and more steerable towards desired ends.One apparent way to solve bias is to weed out toxic text from the pre-training data, but that raises questions about what to exclude. Developers could, for example, train language models on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus6, which excludes web pages containing any of a list of ‘bad’ words, including sometimes-useful ones such as ‘fecal’ and ‘nipple’. That, however, limits the scope of any language model trained on it. A more fine-grained approach has not been attempted at scale, because it can’t easily be automated. Unwanted bias can take the form of blatant slurs or of subtle associations that are hard to locate and excise. And even if we all agreed on what counts as toxic, and could remove it, says Amanda Askell, a philosopher and research scientist at OpenAI, we might not want to blind language models. “If I had a model that had never had any exposure to sexism, and you were to ask it, ‘Is there any sexism in the world,’ maybe it just says, ‘no’.”Researchers have also reported that they can extract sensitive data used to train large language models7. By posing careful questions, they retrieved personal contact information that GPT-2 had memorized verbatim. They found that larger models were more vulnerable than smaller ones to this probing. The best defence, they write, is simply to limit the sensitive information in the training data.All of these concerns suggest that, at a minimum, researchers should publicly document the training data that goes into their models, as Bender and co-authors2 argue. Some university teams, and firms including Google and Facebook, have done this. But others, including Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, have not.OpenAI’s GPT-3 paper won a ‘best paper’ award at the NeurIPS conference last December, but Raffel objects because the study didn’t publish the model, its training data or its code (which specifies how to assemble the model and train its parameters on data). The paper shouldn’t have been accepted at an academic conference, let alone have won an award, he says. “It sets kind of a depressing precedent.” OpenAI declined to comment on the issue; the NeurIPS Foundation, which organizes the conference, said authors aren’t required to release code and data, and code might be hard to share if it is linked to specific computing infrastructure.Nvidia has released the code for its large language model, Megatron-LM, but not the trained model or training data, for reasons it declined to discuss. And Microsoft would not comment on why it hasn’t released code, model or data for its Turing-NLG technology.

Prestigious AI meeting takes steps to improve ethics of research
Askell says OpenAI guards against GPT-3’s injurious use in part by offering users only an application programming interface (API) into the AI, rather than the code itself. Besides creating a service that raises revenue for further research, this allows the team to control the model’s output and revoke access if they see abuse. An internal ‘red team’ looks for ways to get past the API’s filters and generate harmful content, leading to refined filters, Askell says.OpenAI, Google and others won’t have a monopoly on large language models forever, researchers noted in a forum that OpenAI and a handful of universities held last year to discuss the ethical and societal challenges of deploying the models8. Eventually, someone will release a model of similar scale. When OpenAI announced GPT-2 in February 2019, it originally said it wouldn’t release its model because of concerns about malicious use, although it did so nine months later. But before that release, university student Connor Leahy was able to replicate it using a couple of weeks of effort and some cloud-computing credits. Leahy, currently a researcher at the start-up firm Aleph Alpha in Heidelberg, Germany, now leads an independent group of volunteer researchers called EleutherAI, which is aiming to create a GPT-3-sized model. The biggest hurdle, he says, is not code or training data but computation, which a cloud provider called CoreWeave has offered to provide.Fundamentally, GPT-3 and other large language models still lack common sense — that is, an understanding of how the world works, physically and socially. Kevin Lacker, a US tech entrepreneur, asked the model questions such as: “How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?” GPT-3 responded: “It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.” And, after a train of such nonsense, it replied: “I understand these questions.”
It’s possible that a bigger model would do better — with more parameters, more training data, more time to learn. But this will get increasingly expensive, and can’t be continued indefinitely. The opaque complexity of language models creates another limitation. If a model has an unwanted bias or incorrect idea, it’s hard to open up the black box and fix it.One future path lies in combining language models with knowledge bases: curated databases of declarative facts. In work presented at last year’s Association for Computational Linguistics meeting9, researchers fine-tuned GPT-2 on sentences explicitly stating facts and inferences from a compendium of common sense (for instance, if someone cooks spaghetti, that person wants to eat). As a result, it wrote short stories that were more logical. A variation on this idea is combining an already-trained model with a search engine: when the model is asked questions, the search engine can quickly present it with relevant pages to help it answer, says Fabio Petroni, a computer scientist at Facebook in London.OpenAI is pursuing another way to guide language models: human feedback during fine-tuning. In a paper10 presented at last December’s NeurIPS conference, it described work with two smaller versions of GPT-3 that were fine-tuned on how to summarize posts on the social news website Reddit. The team first asked people to rate a group of existing summaries. Then it trained an evaluation model to reproduce that kind of human judgement. Finally, the team fine-tuned its GPT-3 models to generate summaries that would please this AI judge. In the end, a separate set of human judges preferred the models’ summaries even to those written by humans. Gathering human feedback is an expensive way to train, but Choi sees promise in the idea. “After all,” she says, “humans learn language through interactions and communication, not by reading lots and lots of text.”Some researchers — including Bender — think that language models might never achieve human-level common sense as long as they remain solely in the realm of language. Children learn by seeing, experiencing and acting. Language makes sense to us only because we ground it in something beyond letters on a page; people don’t absorb a novel by running statistics on word frequency.Bowman foresees three possible ways to get common sense into language models. It might be enough for a model to consume all the text that’s ever been written. Or it could be trained on YouTube clips so that the moving images can lead to a richer understanding of reality. But this kind of passive consumption might not be enough. “The very pessimistic view,” he says, “is that we only get there once we build an army of robots and let them interact with the world.”Nature 591, 22-25 (2021)Brown, T.

139,New Technique Reveals Centuries of Secrets in Locked Letters,Privacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/science/locked-letters-unfolding.html,"AdvertisementSupported byM.I.T. researchers have devised a virtual-reality technique that lets them read old letters that were mailed not in envelopes but in the writing paper itself after being folded into elaborate enclosures.By William J. BroadIn 1587, hours before her beheading, Mary, Queen of Scots, sent a letter to her brother-in-law Henry III, King of France. But she didn’t just sign it and send it off. She folded the paper repeatedly, cut out a piece of the page and left it dangling. She used that strand of paper to sew the letter tight with locking stitches.In an era before sealed envelopes, this technique, now called letterlocking, was as important for deterring snoops as encryption is to your email inbox today. Although this art form faded in the 1830s with the advent of mass-produced envelopes, it has recently attracted renewed attention from scholars. But they have faced a problem: How do you look at the contents of such locked letters without permanently damaging priceless bits of history?On Tuesday, a team of 11 scientists and scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions disclosed their development of a virtual-reality technique that lets them perform this delicate task without tearing up the contents of historical archives.In the journal Nature Communications, the team tells of virtually opening four undelivered letters written from 1680 and 1706. The dispatches had ended up in a wooden postal trunk in The Hague. Known as the Brienne Collection, the box contains 3,148 items, including 577 letters that were never unlocked.The new technique could open a window into the long history of communications security. And by unlocking private intimacies, it could aid researchers studying stories concealed in fragile pages found in archives all over the world.“Let’s start virtually unfolding” the locked letters, said Daniel S. Smith, a team member at King’s College London, “and seeing what secrets they reveal.”In an interview, Jana Dambrogio, the study’s lead author and a conservator at the M.I.T. Libraries, said that learning of the trove’s existence inspired her to see if more technologically inclined colleagues could find a way to digitally open the locked letters. At the time, in 2014, scholars could read and study such letters only by cutting them open, which often damaged the documents and obscured or eliminated clues as to how they had been secured.“We really need to keep the originals,” Ms. Dambrogio said. “You can keep learning from them, especially if you keep the locked packets closed.”The old letters were protected from prying eyes when the sheets of writing paper were carefully folded to become their own secure enclosures.The first step of their digital opening is to scan a target letter with an advanced X-ray machine. The resulting three-dimensional image — much like a medical scan — reveals the letter’s internal configuration. A computer then analyzes the image to undo the folds and, almost magically, turn the layers into a flat sheet, revealing handwritten text that can be read.The team translated one of the digitally opened letters from the Brienne Collection. It was dated July 31, 1697, and sent from Lille, France, to a French merchant in The Hague. It turned out to be a request for a certified copy of a death notice. The letter also asked for “news of your health.”More analyses of the Brienne Collection, the paper added, may enrich studies not only of postal networks in early modern Europe but of the region’s politics, religion, music, drama and patterns of migration.In addition to announcing its technique for unlocking the letters without damaging them, the team studied 250,000 historical letters that resulted in “the first systematization of letterlocking techniques.” The scientists and scholars found 12 formats of locked letters — the most complex having an overall shape defined by 12 borders — as well as 64 categories involving such manipulations as tucks, slits and folds. The team gave each locked letter a security score.Dr. Smith of King’s College London, who lectures on early modern English literature, said the art was so diverse that a person’s lock could serve almost as a signature. A letter, he said, “became an ambassador for you and had to embody something of you.”Without the ability to unlock letters digitally, it took a decade for scholars to conclude that Mary, Queen of Scots, had secured the letter to her brother-in-law with a distinctive spiral stitch. Virtual unfolding, the team said, could have documented that step “in a matter of days.”And Amanda Ghassaei, one of the M.I.T. researchers, said the team was about to complete an upgrade of the computer code that would reduce the time for a virtual unfolding from days to hours.Deborah Harkness, a historian of science at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the research, described the X-ray technique as “almost an archaeological approach” that seeks to minimize investigator impact on artifact recovery.The new technique presents “significant innovations,” said Howard Hotson, a professor of early modern intellectual history at the University of Oxford who also had no role in the research. For 500 years, he added, letterlocking, a relatively simple technology, prevented anyone from examining correspondence unless a seal was broken.“It has taken some very sophisticated digital technology,” he said, “to frustrate this sophisticated security system.”Advertisement"
140,"Walmart to invest $350 billion in U.S. manufacturing - The country’s largest retailer says the 10-year investment will help create 750,000 jobs",Business,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/03/walmart-usa-manufacturing/,"Walmart plans to invest $350 billion in products made, grown or assembled in the United States over the next 10 years, a move it says will help create 750,000 jobs.The world’s largest retailer said Wednesday it is committing to source a wide range of American-made products, including textiles, plastics, small electrical appliances, food processing, and pharmaceutical and medical supplies.The announcement follows a similar commitment from 2013, when it said it would invest $250 billion in products made (or grown or assembled) domestically. That effort later came under scrutiny after consumer advocacy groups reported what they called misleading labels on Walmart.com to the Federal Trade Commission.“U.S. manufacturing really matters,” John Furner, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “More businesses are choosing to establish their manufacturing operations in the United States, and the result is more jobs for Americans — a lot more jobs.”Biden signs order pushing federal government to buy more American-made productsFurner announced the investment Wednesday during a visit to a Techtronic Industries plant in Anderson, S.C., where the company manufacturers products for brands such as Hoover, Oreck and Dirt Devil that are sold in Walmart stores.Walmart, which has nearly 4,800 stores nationwide, said its efforts could help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by sourcing products closer to its customers. The retail giant, which employs 1.5 million U.S. workers and last year had $524 billion in sales, is a closely watched bellwether. It has a network of thousands of suppliers, which means its purchasing decisions often reverberate throughout the industry.The initiative follows federal efforts to revive U.S. manufacturing. President Biden has vowed to prioritize domestic production and in January ordered government agencies to buy more American-made goods.“These investments will help create well-paid, union jobs, and build our economy back better so that everybody has a fair shot at the middle class,” the White House said in announcing the executive order.The retailer’s Made in America efforts have come under fire in recent years. Truth in Advertising, a consumer advocacy nonprofit group, has repeatedly taken issue with Walmart’s labeling of U.S.-made goods as deceptive and misleading. In 2015, the group said it had found more than 100 instances of misleading labels on the company’s website, on products including teeth-whitening strips and liquid eyeliner, which it reported to the Federal Trade Commission. The agency briefly investigated the matter but closed its inquiry after it concluded Walmart had taken sufficient steps to prevent consumer deception.Struggling U.S. manufacturers pivot to one product where sales are actually booming: MasksEarlier this year, Truth in Advertising filed another complaint with the FTC, saying vacuum cleaners, bath towels and other products on the retailer’s site continue to be labeled as “Made in the USA when they contain imported components.” It called on the agency to “put an end to Walmart’s deceptive made in the USA claims once and for all.”In a statement, Walmart said it appreciates the group’s efforts and shares its interests.“We take our commitment to U.S. manufacturing seriously,” the retailer said. “We have seen some wonderful success stories based on our initiative and hope to contribute to further expansion of U.S. manufacturing and job growth.”The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

That’s 175 with 21 zeroes after it. That amount of information will require massive data centres and vast energy resources to maintain. A small but growing group of researchers advocates DNA as a sustainable, stable replacement.These efforts got a lift last November, when a coalition of computing and biotech firms including Microsoft, Twist Bioscience, Illumina and Western Digital announced that they were forming the DNA Data Storage Alliance (DDSA). The alliance hopes to “organize the industry and think of how to build the whole ecosystem for DNA data storage”, says Xavier Godron, chief technology officer at DNA Script, a Paris-based developer of bench-top DNA synthesizers and a member of the alliance.Karin Strauss, a researcher at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, says the DDSA formed in response to the “critical mass and community” coalescing around the technology, which until recently was largely theoretical. “It sounded like science fiction five years ago. It’s really starting to happen,” she says.The process of DNA data storage combines DNA synthesis, DNA sequencing and an encoding and decoding algorithm to pack information into DNA more durably and at higher density than is possible in conventional media. That could be up to 17 exabytes per gram1.In a demonstration of the technology last October, geneticist George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and his team described a way to encode a snippet of music from the video game Super Mario Bros in the transitions between runs of identical synthetic genetic bases, and then retrieve it and play it back on a computer2. Olgica Milenkovic at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her team have developed a ‘DNA punch card’ strategy that encodes data in nicks made in the DNA backbone; they used the technique to store a copy of former US president Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address and an image of the Lincoln Memorial3. And Robert Grass at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and his team have devised a strategy for embedding digital genetic information — instructions for 3D printing an object, for instance — into the object itself, an approach they call “DNA-of-things”4.The low-hanging fruit for DNA data storage is what Twist Bioscience chief executive Emily Leproust in San Francisco, California, calls ‘cold data’ — data that are written once and read rarely, if ever. That’s because DNA remains stable for a long time, but data access — through sequencing and data analysis — is slow.DNA has already proved itself to be up to the task of big data, albeit not in peer-reviewed publications. The DNA-storage firm Catalog in Boston, Massachusetts, another alliance member, announced in 2019 that it had used its DNA-writing technology to encode all of English-language Wikipedia into genetic material. And last year, Twist announced that it had stored an episode of the Netflix series Biohackers.Others see broader opportunities, and Church, for one, encourages researchers to think outside the box. Imagine fruit flies that can record video of everything they see in their DNA, or human tissues capable of storing physiological data. “If you have a new revolution, it’s usually misguided to try to apply it to the old way of thinking,” he says.Organick, L. et al.

142,"Square acquires Tidal, Jay-Z’s streaming service, in $297 million deal.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/business/media/tidal-square-jay-z-dorsey.html,"AdvertisementBy Katherine RosmanWhat did Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey talk about when they went yachting around the Hamptons together last summer? Perhaps only Beyoncé knows.Maybe now we do, too. Square, the mobile payments company led by Mr. Dorsey, announced on Thursday its plan to acquire a “significant majority” of Tidal, the streaming music service owned by Jay-Z and other artists — including Beyoncé, Jay-Z’s wife, and Rihanna, who is a client of Jay-Z’s entertainment management company, Roc Nation.Square will pay $297 million in stock and cash for the stake in Tidal. Jay-Z will join Square’s board.The announcement comes less than two weeks after Jay-Z announced that he would sell 50 percent of his champagne company, Armand de Brignac — better known as Ace of Spades — to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton amid a downturn in the entertainment industry caused by the pandemic that has affected some of Jay-Z’s holdings.“I think Roc Nation will be fine,” Jay-Z said in an interview last month about the sale of Armand de Brignac. “Like all entertainment companies, it will eventually recover. You just have to be smart and prudent at a time like this.”Also last month, Mr. Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, announced that he and Jay-Z had endowed a Bitcoin trust to support development in India and Africa.Tidal, which Jay-Z bought in partnership with other artists in 2015 for $56 million, provides members access to music, music videos and exclusive content from artists, but the streaming music industry has been dominated by competitors like Spotify, Apple and Amazon.In 2017, Jay-Z sold 33 percent of the company to Sprint for an undisclosed amount. (After a merger, Sprint is now a part of T-Mobile.) Earlier this week, Jay-Z bought back the shares from T-Mobile, and most will be sold to Square as part of the deal.Mr. Dorsey and Jay-Z began to discuss the acquisition “a few months ago,” said Jesse Dorogusker, a Square executive who will lead Tidal on an interim basis.“It started as a conversation between the two of them,” he said. “They found that sense of common purpose.”Mr. Dorogusker said Square, which was founded in 2009, will offer financial tools to help Tidal’s artists collect revenue and manage their finances. “There are other tools they need to be successful and that we’re going to build for them,” he said.Advertisement"

144,Mapping internet shutdowns around the world,Networking/Telecom,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/3/mapping-internet-shutdowns-around-the-world,"In 2020, India topped list of 29 countries that blocked access to the internet despite increased demand during COVID-19.Over the past year, billions of people all over the world have relied heavily on internet connectivity to keep in touch with family and friends, learn online, work from home and get vital information about the coronavirus pandemic.Yet over the course of 2020, 29 countries intentionally shut down or slowed their internet communications at least 155 times, according to a new report published by Access Now, a non-profit digital rights group.“We are extremely concerned how government authorities are using internet shutdowns as a systemised tool to repress democratic expression, even in the middle of a global pandemic,” Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now said.Authorities in India shut down the internet 109 times over the course of 2020, mostly in Indian-administered Kashmir, which accounted for almost 90 percent of all internet shutdowns in India last year.From January 2020 till February of this year, the internet in Indian-administered Kashmir was throttled to 2G, making life very difficult for many students in the state who had been moved to remote learning as a result of COVID-19.“We weren’t able to attend our online classes regularly,” said Bazillah Ayoub, 24, a student at the Model Institute of Engineering and Technology in Jammu.“We had a lot of issues – we were asked to submit our assignments which were sometimes 15MB or above that, which got uploaded after one or two hours. Due to that, we all have backlogs in our subjects because we have not submitted our assignments on time,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.Internet shutdowns in Indian-administered Kashmir are a regular occurrence, with authorities citing precautionary measures as the main justification.“Shutdowns are used to suppress voices of dissent,” said youth activist Kanwal Singh, 30. “We have been a conflict state for the last 70 years.”People in Indian-administered Kashmir experienced one of the longest internet shutdowns in the world with a complete blackout from August 2019 to January 2020, after which the throttled speed of 2G was allowed. The authorities recently restored 4G services in Indian-administered Kashmir after 18 months.Last year, India’s Supreme Court ordered a review into Kashmir’s internet shutdowns, stating that they were unconstitutional and violated India’s telecoms rules.“Any government or authority is not doing charity by restoring the 4G services,” said Singh. “When the government restored 4G services everyone started celebrating, but the point is this is not charity. This is our right and everyone’s right because this is guaranteed by the Indian constitution.”In addition to India, the governments of Myanmar, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam also blocked access to the internet in 2020.Myanmar has imposed the longest shutdown recorded to date, which continued from 2019 through 2020 and up to early February this year in Rakhine and Chin states.As mass protests continue in the country, internet services remain precarious, despite full internet access being restored by authorities in Rakhine and Chin after a military coup last month.In Bangladesh, Rohingya refugee camps were cut off from high-speed internet for 415 days. The Rohingya Students Network said people in camps were unable to access vital health information during COVID-19 because of internet throttling.During the August 2020 Belarusian election, the government blocked social media channels including WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber and Twitter as well as VPNs and Tor browsers.Despite this, protesters took to the streets to contest Alexander Lukashenko’s presidential victory. As a result, the government imposed a full internet shutdown from the night of August 9 to August 12, 2020.Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova, who has been covering the protests in Belarus, told Al Jazeera, “It was very difficult to verify information and do fact-checking because we received a lot of user-generated content.”“Telegram channels became really important for citizens because that was the only platform that kind of worked a little bit at least,” said Liubakova. “It became the main source of information for so many people and the trend continues right now.”An increased number of internet shutdowns have been deployed in areas of conflict. During last year’s war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan shut down social media and communication to citizens for six weeks. The government said it had been done to prevent Armenian provocation.The country with the most internet shutdowns in the Middle East in 2020 has been Yemen, a country mired in armed conflict and humanitarian crisis. These shutdowns exacerbated the situation, making access to information and communication – both by Yemenis and by international organisations attempting to work in the country – very difficult.In January 2020, 80 percent of internet capacity was cut in Yemen following reports of sabotage to fibre optic cables by Houthi rebels.Jordan experienced three national shutdowns in 2020. The government restricted Facebook Live during a teachers’ union protest in July and August 2020. The Ministry of Education also blocked communication applications such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Facebook during national exams.Other Middle Eastern countries that shut down the internet include Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Egypt and Algeria.Internet and telecommunication services have been shut down across several African countries including Burundi, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda.In Ethiopia, 100 million people were plunged into a complete media blackout for two weeks following protests after the killing of Oromo musician, Haacaaluu Hundeessaa.In Kenya, there were at least two reported internet disruptions in 2020 after two telecommunications towers were destroyed in Mandera County by the Somali armed group, al-Shabab.Internet shutdowns have also occurred in Venezuela, Ecuador and Cuba.In 2020, the Cuban government blocked access to Telegram, WhatsApp, Twitter, and other social media platforms for three days following rare large public protests decrying curbs to civil liberties.Governments have justified internet shutdowns citing fake news, precautionary measures, public safety and national security among other reasons.The actual reasons for shutdowns have stemmed from political instability, elections, protests, communal violence, information control and exam cheating.Seven countries including India, Guinea, Belarus, Burundi, Kyrgyzstan, Tanzania and Togo shut down the internet during an election period in 2020."
145,SpaceX lands Starship prototype rocket for the first time after a high-altitude flight test,Space,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/spacex-lands-starship-sn10-rocket-after-a-high-altitude-flight-test.html,"SpaceX's Starship prototype exploded shortly after landing for the first time following a high-altitude flight test on Wednesday.The cause of the explosion, or whether it was intentional, was not immediately clear. Elon Musk alternatively refers to explosions as ""RUDs,"" or Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly.The company test flew Starship rocket Serial Number 10, or SN10. SpaceX aimed to launch the prototype as high as 10 kilometers, or about 32,800 feet altitude. There were no passengers onboard the rocket, as it is a development vehicle and flies autonomously.The SN10 flight was similar to the ones SpaceX conducted in December and February, when it test flew prototypes SN8 and SN9, respectively. Both prior rockets completed several development objectives – including testing aerodynamics, shutting down the engines in succession, and flipping to orient for landing –but both prototypes exploded on impact as they attempted to land, unable to slow down enough.Like SN8 and SN9, the goal of the SN10 flight was not necessarily to reach the maximum altitude, but rather to test several key parts of the Starship system. SpaceX fired all three engines for liftoff and then shut them down one at a time in sequence as the rocket neared the top of the flight's intended altitude.SN10 then transferred propellant from the main tanks to the header tanks, before flipping itself for the ""belly flop"" reentry maneuver – which gives it a controlled descent through the air with the rocket's four flaps. Then, in the final moments of descent, SpaceX flipped the rocket and returned it to a vertical orientation, firing the Raptor engines to slow itself down for the landing.""Third time's the charm, as the saying goes – we've had a successful soft touchdown on the landing pad,"" SpaceX principal integration engineer John Insprucker said on the company's webcastThe Starship prototype stands at about 150 feet tall, or about the size of a 15-story building, and is powered by three Raptor rocket engines The rocket is built of stainless steel, representing the early versions of the rocket unveiled in 2019. ""The Texas team has several more suborbital test vehicles in build, with number 11 ready to roll out to the pad in the very near future,"" Insprucker said.Musk's company is developing Starship with the goal of launching cargo and people on missions to the moon and Mars.Starship is one of two ""Manhattan Projects"" that SpaceX is simultaneously developing, with the other being its Starlink satellite internet program. Musk has previously estimated that it will cost about $5 billion to fully develop Starship, although SpaceX has not disclosed how much it has spent on the program to date.The company last month brought in $850 million in its latest capital fundraise at a $74 billion valuation.Musk remains ""highly confident"" that Starship ""will be safe enough for human transport by 2023"" – an ambitious goal given the company began the rocket's development and testing in earnest in early 2019.But Musk's timeline is key, as Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has paid for a Starship flight around the moon by 2023. Maezawa on Tuesday announced that he is inviting eight members of the public to join his dearMoon mission, which will be a six-day journey to the moon and back.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.Got a confidential news tip?

It claimed it had discovered 98 posts on Parler that encouraged violence, and notified the social network about them.AWS said it acted because Parler was ""unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content"".The BBC has contacted Parler, which has lodged a ""voluntary dismissal"" of the action in a district court in Seattle, for comment.Since 15 February, the social network has been back online, using alternative hosting services.But its app cannot be downloaded from Apple or Google’s app stores, as both companies removed Parler in January for similar reasons to Amazon's.Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of Donald Trump and other conservatives.

The Center for Early Education's digital servers have been breached in recent weeks, and law enforcement is investigating, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. One or more hackers have published staff payroll documentation in email blasts riddled with racist, sexist and homophobic language.“It’s a shitshow,” says one individual close to the situation. THR is informed that private security personnel and federal law enforcement officials have been notified and commenced investigative inquiries. Sources say they have been told that the FBI is investigating. The FBI declined to comment.The Center for Early Education in West Hollywood educates children of top entertainment executives and high-profile talent. Due to the pandemic, this academic year has required an unprecedented reliance on internet tools not just for virtual learning but to augment other aspects of the school experience, including communication with parents. The Center declined to discuss the breach with THR.The intruders' messages, in some cases framed as party invites — and featuring, in at least one instance, as a seeming lure, the name of a prominent parent in the subject line — were sent to children as well as their proxy contacts, including family members and other care providers. (Presumably drawn from the students’ internal school profiles.)One note featured rhetoric suggesting that white teachers should receive pay raises.The Center has longstanding, intimate ties with Hollywood. To protect the privacy of minors, The Hollywood Reporter does not disclose the names of current students. However, the Center’s alumni include Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jonah Hill, while its board features former Disney COO Thomas Staggs.March 3, 6:31 pm: The initial version of this story incorrectly stated the Windward School and Carlthorp were also targets of the  hack. The schools have since stated they were not part of the breach.Gary Baum

150,Opinion | The White House’s use of Zoom for meetings raises China-related security concerns,Security,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/03/white-house-zoom-biden-meetings-china-cybersecurity/,"The Biden White House is using the teleconference platform Zoom for most of its unclassified government-related virtual interactions, even as the Justice Department is prosecuting one of the company’s China-based executives for working with Beijing’s intelligence services to interfere in Zoom calls. Some lawmakers, former officials and experts are warning that the Biden administration may be ignoring the risks.In December, during the presidential transition, the DOJ unveiled an indictment and issued an arrest warrant for Xinjiang Jin, also known as “Juliean Jin,” a China-based Zoom employee, accusing him of manipulating Zoom’s internal systems to interfere in U.S. calls that included content criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.The complaint alleges Jin worked directly with Chinese government intelligence agents to surveil and then disrupt Zoom calls commemorating the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre. He also is accused of providing personal data of Communist Party critics to the authorities in Beijing.This is not the Chinese government censoring its own citizens — this is the Chinese government allegedly using a Zoom employee to harass Americans and put them in direct danger of retaliation. A human rights group sent me the video of one event that was crashed. Their discussion of human rights in China was repeatedly interrupted with pro-CCP propaganda videos and hard-core pornography.“No company with significant business interests in China is immune from the coercive power of the Chinese Communist Party,” said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, when announcing the charges. He remains on the job.In its response to the DOJ complaint, Zoom said Chinese authorities had made it clear the company must follow Chinese law or be shut down in China. The company also said it has put in place various measures meant to ensure that the Chinese government is only able to impose its laws on Chinese citizens and that Americans’ data is safer.Nevertheless, the White House has to be especially careful about cyber security threats, and its reliance on Zoom is a problem, the House’s Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks (Ind.) wrote in a letter to Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff. Banks asked the White House to disclose exactly which meetings it was using for Zoom, whether any classified information was included in those meetings, and he asked, “Why is Zoom being used, rather than alternatives, given the history of Zoom meetings being infiltrated by agents of the Chinese Communist Party?”Two senior Biden administration officials told me that they inherited the Zoom system from the Trump administration, meaning they did not initiate the contract. They also emphasized the White House uses Zoom for Government, a more secure version, and not for classified meetings. All Zoom for Government communications “are processed exclusively in continental U.S. data centers that are managed solely by U.S.-based, U.S. people,” a Zoom spokesperson told me. The officials said the Biden administration would do a full review of all its communications policies and procedures but they declined to share any details of that review.A former senior Trump administration official acknowledged that the Trump administration had used Zoom, but pointed out that the Trump administration practiced lots of unsafe cyber security habits so it should not be held up as the standard going forward. Some Trump administration officials were more careful than others.“The [National Security Council] was terrified of Zoom,” the former official said. “The NSC went out of its way not to use Zoom for any meetings because they were told it was not safe to use Zoom for any official capacity.”Klon Kitchen, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told me that although Zoom is an American company, as long as it uses engineers inside China, there will always be a risk in using the platform. That risk should not be overstated, he said, but the White House has the option to use a company that isn’t constrained by Chinese law or as vulnerable to Chinese government tampering.“There’s good reason to believe Zoom has made significant strides in their cybersecurity and that for normal Americans’ use, it’s probably fine,” he said. “But if you are the White House, you have a higher cybersecurity bar that you need to get over and there’s just no reason to assume that risk.”Perhaps recognizing that national security concerns are impacting its image in Washington, Zoom just hired to its board former Trump administration national security adviser H.R. McMaster. McMaster’s latest book calls the Chinese Communist Party the greatest threat in a generation. Last month, he gave a book talk to Banks’s Republican Study Committee. The event was held over Zoom.Read more:Karen Attiah: The impeachment videos put the hypocrisy of Blue Lives Matter on full displayHenry Olsen: Pelosi’s Jan. 6 commission is an excellent idea — if it’s done rightMichael Gerson: Trump’s rot has reached the GOP’s rootsJennifer Rubin: Why we need a 1/6 commissionThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

152,Honda launches world's first level 3 self-driving car,Transportation,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-launches-world-s-first-level-3-self-driving-car,"Plan for just 100 lease sales reflects Japanese automaker's cautious approachTOKYO -- Honda Motor will on Friday launch a new car equipped with the world's first certified level 3 autonomous driving technology, paving the way for the automobile industry to gear up efforts to commercialize such automation for passenger vehicles.Industry experts are cautiously watching to see if the Legend, a luxury sedan that operates without driver supervision under certain conditions but requires the driver to assume control of the vehicle within seconds when alerted, can capture enough demand to suggest a way forward for other manufacturers.Honda unveiled the Legend on Thursday at an online press event.""Most accidents involve human error, and driving will be more exciting if we can mitigate the driver's fatigue and stress,"" Yoichi Sugimoto, who oversees driver assistance technology at Honda R&D, told reporters.""We aim to reduce the driving burden. ... We are entering a new stage of Honda Sensing,"" he added, referring to Honda's driving assistance technology.The new model's Traffic Jam Pilot system was approved by Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in November. It can free drivers from driving in congested traffic on an expressway when travelling slower than 50 kilometers per hour.The system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers while monitoring the vehicle's surroundings, using data from high-definition mapping and external sensors.The driver, meanwhile, can enjoy the vehicle's infotainment using the navigation screen but must respond to the system's request for a handover when the vehicle speeds up after the traffic jam eases.""The driver and the system will share the driving task,"" said Sugimoto. The Traffic Jam Pilot is the ""first step for it, and we would like to assess how autonomous driving is welcomed at the Japanese market.""Honda is taking a cautious approach to introducing this cutting-edge function. Only 100 units will be produced, available only for lease sales. The model is priced at 11 million yen ($102,000).Another reason for the limited run is the need to ""explain this new technology clearly,"" said Kimiyoshi Teratani, who manages Honda's Japan business, adding that leasing would allow regular and thorough maintenance.Honda said it simulated around 10 million possible situations, and conducted test drives on highways for approximately 1.3 million kilometers, in developing the car.It also set the speed limit much lower than the 60 kph allowed by regulations.The level 3 technology ""is what will be needed in the future for sure,"" said Sugimoto. He said it would eventually be distributed ""hopefully in a decade or two"" for one of Honda's top-selling models.The car also offers various ""level 2"" driving assistance features, such as hands-off driving when following a car in front within a lane or changing lanes. The model is also equipped with an emergency stop system, which decelerates and stops the car at a safe place if the driver remains unresponsive to a take-over request.So-called level 4 mobility services are already provided or largely tested by players including Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet, and China's Baidu. Such services do not even require a driver in theory.With Germany's Mercedes-Benz also set to launch a model with level 3 autonomy later this year, the market for self-driving personal vehicles is likely to heat up.Fuji Chimera Research Institute, a market research company, expects that such level 3 technology will be more broadly applied from around 2030 and that almost 43 million vehicles globally will have such technology by 2045.The Japanese government has been upbeat about pushing forward with autonomous driving. It introduced a revised legal framework in April 2020 to make the car, instead of the driver, responsible for the driving.The World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations has also adopted the Traffic Jam Pilot technology as a global standard.Seiji Sugiura, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, said the new Legend marks Honda's technological farsightedness.""There is a tremendous difference between level 2 and 3, involving a question of who will be responsible at an accident: the system or the driver,"" he said. Although he acknowledges it is too early to judge if other companies will follow, ""Honda believes the importance of being the front runner,"" Sugiura added.Takaki Nakanishi, the CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute, said that while it was meaningful for Honda to be kickstarting a new market for autonomous driving for personal cars, the sensors on the car cost millions of yen.""If the driver helps supervising the driving [as in level 2 technology], driving assistance functions can be offered at a much cheaper price,"" Nakanishi said. ""The limited features of level three 'minus' may not be worth the cost if we compare it with level two 'plus' we have today.""Sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.Discover the all new Nikkei Asia appDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia appStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia; the most dynamic market in the world.Stay ahead with our exclusives on AsiaGet trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.Get trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.

154,Google announces major shift away from precision-targeting of ads based on everything you do on the internet,Business,https://www.businessinsider.com/google-to-stop-tracking-individuals-web-browsing-precision-ad-targeting-2021-3,"EditionGoogle said on Wednesday that it would move away from using technologies that track specific users as they browse the web, a move that could upend the digital advertising industry.Google had previously announced plans to eliminate a technology called third-party cookies, saying its Chrome browser would no longer use it by 2022. The search giant now says that it will not create or use any other tools that identify individual users for advertising purposes.However, Google will still allow its advertising customers to target users across its range of services - from YouTube to Gmail and search - if the users are logged into their Google accounts, Digiday reported. The announcement doesn't affect mobile apps and mobile-app trackers, and it doesn't prevent publishers from selling ads based on information about how a user behaved on their sites.While Google acknowledged that other providers may continue to offer advertisers the ability to track individuals across the web, its decision could still upend the digital advertising industry, which has long relied on these types of tracking technologies.Google's rivals and other participants in the advertising ecosystem have been watching Google's moves closely. The UK's competition regulator is even investigating a complaint from an advertising-industry group alleging that Google's decision to remove third-party cookies from Chrome and replace them with technologies from its Privacy Sandbox would limit competition in the digital ad market. Other companies have been adding feedback and discussing their own proposals for cookie alternatives in subcommittees of the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, a key web-standards group.NextCopyright © 2021.

155,ICANN Refuses to Accredit Pirate Bay Founder Peter Sunde Due to His 'Background',Business,https://torrentfreak.com/icann-refuses-to-accredit-pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-due-to-his-background-210303/,"
Home > Law and Politics > 

 
Peter Sunde is one of the original Pirate Bay founders, but in recent years he's mostly known for his role in various Internet-related startups. This includes domain registrar Sarek, for which Sunde tried to get ICANN accreditation. However, this request was denied, apparently due to Sunde's 'uncomfortable' background.
Peter Sunde was one of the key people behind The Pirate Bay in the early years, a role for which he was eventually convicted in Sweden. While Sunde cut his ties with the notorious torrent site many years ago, he remains an active and vocal personality on the Internet.In recent years Sunde has focused on several other projects. His links to the domain registration service Njalla and the Ipredator VPN are well known, and he also hosted the documentary series “Activisten” on Finnish television.Sunde is also involved with the domain registrar Sarek, which caters to technology enthusiasts and people who are interested in a fair and balanced Internet, promising low prices for domain registrations As a business, everything was going well for Sarek. The company made several deals with domain registries to offer cheap domains but there is one element that’s missing. To resell the most popular domains, including .com and .org, it has to be accredited by ICANN.ICANN is the main oversight body for the Internet’s global domain name system. Among other things, it develops policies for accredited registrars to prevent abuse and illegal use of domain names. Without this accreditation, reselling several popular domains simply isn’t an option. Sunde and the Sarek team hoped to overcome this hurdle and started the ICANN accreditation process in 2019. After a long period of waiting, the organization recently informed Sunde that his application was denied. Needless to say, Sunde was disappointed with the decision and he took his frustration to Twitter a few days ago. Initially, he assumed that the application was denied because ICANN concluded that he ‘lied’ about his background. The accreditation form requires applicants to tick a box if they have been convicted for fraud or something similar. Sunde didn’t tick this box, as he was convicted for criminal copyright infringement. This ‘error’ was swiftly noticed by ICANN, which is also uneasy with other parts of the Pirate Bay founder’s history.“After the background check I get a reply that I’ve checked the wrong boxes,” Sunde wrote. “Not only that, but they’re also upset I was wanted by Interpol.”The Twitter thread didn’t go unnoticed by ICANN who contacted Sunde over the phone to offer clarification. As it turns out, the ‘wrong box’ issue isn’t the main problem, as he explains in a follow-up Twitter thread.“I got some sort of semi-excuse regarding their claim that I lied on my application. They also said that they agreed it wasn’t fraud or similar really. So both of the points they made regarding the denial were not really the reason,” Sunde clarifies.Over the phone, ICANN explained that the matter was discussed internally. This unnamed group of people concluded that the organization is ‘not comfortable’ doing business with him.“They basically admitted that they don’t like me. They’ve banned me for nothing else than my political views. This is typical discrimination. Considering I have no one to appeal to except them, it’s concerning, since they control the actual fucking center of the internet.”ICANN hasn’t commented publicly on the matter and the organization didn’t immediately respond to our request for further information. However, Sunde tells us that his ‘background’ is obviously the reason for the denial. And copyright plays a role in this as well.“They said it outright in the phone call, it’s me they don’t feel comfortable with. They said they take Intellectual Property rights so seriously that I can’t join,” Sunde tells us.Making matters worse, ICANN will also keep the registration fee, so this whole ordeal is costing money as well. While Sunde understands that there are people who don’t agree with his views on certain things, that shouldn’t be a problem here. After all, ICANN is heavily regulated and it could easily revoke accreditation should its policies be violated.Without an on-the-record statement from ICANN, we can only speculate on what ‘background issues’ the organization is concerned with. There are a few to choose from. Needless to say, The Pirate Bay has caused ICANN quite a few headaches. Over the years copyright industry groups such as the MPA and RIAA have repeatedly asked ICANN to step in and ban these domains. Thus far, ICANN has always said that it doesn’t want to ‘police the Internet’ and that courts can deal with this issue. However, the pressure from rightsholders may indirectly play a role here. Sunde may have upset ICANN in other ways as well. Roughly a decade ago, he promoted a P2P-based DNS system to compete with ICANN’s root-server and bypass its control over the Internet. And then there’s the privacy-oriented domain registration service Njalla, where Sunde is involved as well. Njalla is a legitimate company that helps people maintain their privacy, but copyright holders don’t like it, as it frustrates their enforcement efforts. Just a few months ago, several rightsholder groups nominated Njalla for the US Trade Representative annual overview of “notorious markets,” which may have factored into ICANN’s decision as well.Whatever the reason, Sunde is clearly disappointed and he has already filed a complaint at ICANN. In addition, he reached out to digital and human rights groups to see if there are more options to appeal.“I’m talking with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and ARTICLE 19 right now,” Sunde tells us. “And I’ve left a complaint with the ICANN complaints team, but that will likely lead to nothing.”Law and PoliticsThere are 3 comments.

156,Microsoft promises to ease the pains of going passwordless,Software,https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-promises-to-ease-the-pains-of-going-passwordless/,"Roughly 200 million people using Microsoft services already have made the jump past passwords.Yubico's YubiKeys can make login more secure and help you move beyond passwords.Microsoft is updating its widely used cloud computing technology to make it easier for millions of us to dump our passwords.The tech giant is making passwordless login a standard feature for Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based service customers can use to handle their employees' login chores, the company said at its Ignite conference on Tuesday. The three-day conference, held online this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, is geared for IT and other tech staff who use Microsoft's products.In another update, Microsoft is smoothing out a potential difficulty of going passwordless with a new technology called Temporary Access Pass, which makes it easier for users to enroll in new services without generating a password. It's a one-time, short-term login code IT managers can send users for their initial login. It's also useful for recovering account access in the event of a problem, like losing a security key or phone used for login. It's only available as a preview technology so far, though.The software behemoth's effort to move past passwords comes amid growing recognition of their limitations for authentication. We pick bad passwords, reuse them and often forget them. When stolen, hackers sell them to anyone who wants to try breaking into our accounts. One security site, Have I Been Pwned, has tallied more than 613 million stolen passwords.That's why security professionals are moving to augment passwords with other authentication systems such as biometrics, like Windows Hello or Apple's Face ID, and hardware security keys like Yubico's YubiKeys.Standards developed by the FIDO Alliance are designed to let you dump passwords altogether. The standards are built into hardware security keys and dovetail with technology like fingerprint or face recognition. They also guard against phishing efforts to steer you to fake websites designed to harvest login information that can be used to steal your money and your identity, because FIDO login credentials only work on the genuine website to which they're linked.Microsoft's efforts at going passwordless are bearing fruit. Roughly 200 million people have enabled passwordless login for Microsoft services, such as Outlook and Xbox Live, according to Joy Chik, who runs the company's identity products. That's up a third from the 150 million people who had enabled passwordless login as of last May. Many of those still use passwords as a login fallback, Chik said, but starting the spring, Microsoft will let people remove their old passwords and go completely passwordless."
157,Motor Mouth: How hydrogen ‘powerpaste’ could change how we drive,Nanotech/Materials,https://driving.ca/features/feature-story/motor-mouth-how-hydrogen-powerpaste-could-change-how-we-drive,"[If you are interested in hydrogen as a fuel, or in reduced tailpipe emissions in general, why not join us for Postmedia’s first-ever Driving into the Future roundtable — The Road to Zero Emissions — on Wednesday, February 17 at 11:00 AM EST? —Ed.]One of the big reasons fuel cell-powered vehicles — (not so) affectionately called “fool cells” by Tesla’s Lord Elon — haven’t caught on is simple distrust. A testament that mankind can occasionally learn from its past — especially if something goes boom! — the crash of the Hindenburg 83 long years ago still haunts us all.Worries that their car might suddenly turn into a fireball is a major concern for the mainstream commuter looking for an emissions-free alternative to the internal-combustion engine. Oh, engineers and policy wonks will rhyme off distribution costs and the massive amount of electricity that hydrolysis requires as the biggest impediments to widespread hydrogen usage, but for the man on the street, it is those horrific images of the giant airship’s seemingly spontaneous combustion that remains hydrogen’s public face forward. The idea of hydrogen as savage and minacious will be forever etched into our consciousness. Even if, were we to really examine its relative risk, we’d probably find gasoline is actually more dangerous.But what if hydrogen gas could be made safe — safe enough, in fact, you could leave it in your garage? Hell, on your Roche Bobois coffee table in your favourite room in the house if you really wanted? What if, in fact, the hydrogen in question wasn’t even a gas?I know what you’re thinking. You don’t need to know a periodic table from a kitchen dining set to know hydrogen has to be pretty darned cold — minus 252.87 degrees Centigrade, in point of fact, colder than nitrogen — to be rendered liquid. That’s minus 423.17 degrees F, by the way, just in case you’re still stuck in Imperial for the truly big numbers.Nonetheless, a company in Dresden — Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM — has seemingly found a way to make hydrogen as inert as the “slime” your three-year-old plays with. In fact, it looks and feels pretty much like a “stress-relief sludge toy” that captures the mind of any toddler facing the pressures of, well, learning to crawl. Officially, it’s called Hydrogen Powerpaste, but it looks like the goop you use to caulk bathtubs. And, because I know the question was on the tip of your tongue, the company says it’s completely stable until at least 250 C and will happily sit in a fuel tank for extended periods of time without decomposing.As for how it generates electricity, the engineers at Fraunhofer say they extrude the magnesium hydride slush into a chamber where it is mixed with water and, presto, it creates hydrogen, which feeds a fuel cell that, in turn, provides the electricity to power an electric motor. The magnesium hydride and water are housed in different tanks until they are ready to be mixed and the goop itself supplies a little less than half the hydrogen — MgH2 is, in fact, 7.66 per cent, by weight, hydrogen — while the water, H20, of course,  is 11.1 per cent hydrogen. According to the researchers, depending on the relative size of the tanks, some fill-ups might be as simple as taking a garden hose to your filler cap.The challenges, as with all technologies in their infancy, are huge. For one thing, the system is actually being developed for e-scooters because, well, Vespas and motorcycles have an acute problem with battery range. To wit: While it’s fairly easy  to fit the 400 or 500 kilograms of a long-range 100-kilowatt-hour battery into the chassis of a car, it’s extremely difficult — that should be read “impossible” — to do so for a motorcycle powered by current lithium-ion technology.Indeed, today’s full-sized electric motorcycles can barely eke out 125 kilometres at highway speeds. Fraunhofer claims its Powerpaste is some 10 times as energy-dense as lithium-ion, and that it also has greater energy storage ability than gaseous hydrogen stored at 10,000 psi. In fact, says Fraunhofer, Powerpaste boasts range on par with — “or even greater than” —  gasoline.The limitations of Powerpaste are obvious. How does one pump such a sludge into a tank and, more importantly, what the heck does one do with it once it’s depleted as a source of hydrogen? Can the spent magnesium actually be recycled for re-use as a fuel? For its part, Fraunhofer sees the magnesium hydride housed in replaceable containers — sort of like the replaceable batteries Taiwanese electric scooter manufacturer Gogoro is touting. But, while that might be manageable for a lightweight two-wheeler, it sounds impractical for a full-sized automobile (although not nearly as idiotic as the battery-swapping proposed by Israel’s Better Place).And then there’s the energy required to produce the goop. Will the energy in/energy out equation be comparable to current battery-powered cars — on a well-to-wheels basis — or closer to current hydrogen production techniques? Will the convenience of refuelling outweigh the premium charged?The company does claim, however, that the infrastructure needed won’t be nearly as expensive as gaseous hydrogen —  it’s claiming tens of thousands of dollars for a charging station rather than millions — and that it will be more easily transported. The company also says it’s even cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are required, nor is refrigeration needed to keep liquid hydrogen hyper-cold — perhaps Powerpaste would actually be cheaper than conventional hydrogen.Perhaps more important, however, is that Fraunhofer’s research has changed the paradigm surrounding hydrogen as a fuel. It speaks to a hydrogen-fuelled future unencumbered by the limitations of the past. Even if Fraunhofer’s system doesn’t work, we are no longer looking at hydrogen as a cumbersome, difficult-to-manage gas that could explode with the slightest of sparks (the Hindenburg catastrophe was, of course, blamed on plain old static electricity). Regardless of whether this Powerpaste experiment is successful, it does show the hydrogen that fuels the future could be as innocuous as a gooey slime that your kids play with. Fraunhofer’s researchers certainly think the potential is huge; they’re building a pilot plant that will produce four tons of magnesium hydride by the end of the year.365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

Replacement planes will be 25% more fuel-efficient, the U.S. airline said.In February 2020, Delta announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next decade in initiatives like offsets, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon sequestration that would limit the impact of global air travel on the environment, the first airline to make a commitment of that scale.That followed moves in Europe by easyJet to offset emissions on all its flights and by British Airways and Air France to do the same on their domestic flights.Delta has agreed to purchase a future supply of 70 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year.The amount the U.S. carrier plans to pay for offsets from March 1 to Dec. 31 would equate to less than 0.35% of its revenue during the period, based on Reuters calculations using Delta’s financial results from April 1 to Dec. 31.Delta said the carbon tonnage offset was equal to the carbon sequestered by 17 million acres of U.S. forests in one year, enough to cover the state of West Virginia.The Biden administration is pressuring U.S. airlines to do more to reduce emissions.The chief executives of major U.S. carriers met with White House officials last week to discuss tackling aviation pollution and urge U.S. support for greener aviation fuel.United Airlines has committed to a multimillion-dollar investment in carbon capture, a technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as part of a plan to be 100% green by 2050.Delta said it also believed carbon capture had significant potential.Delta owns its own oil refinery, making it unique among its peers. The company posted a $102 million refining segment loss in the fourth quarter and a $441 million loss on third party fuel sales.The refinery, located in Trainer, Pennsylvania, emitted about 1.45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent gas in 2019, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.That year, the net quantity of greenhouse gasses of the petroleum products the refinery produced totaled roughly 26 million metric tons, according to the EPA.Reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Chicago, Jamie Freed in Sydney and Laura Sanicola in New York; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Paul SimaoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The firm has a rigorous approval process for iOS apps and has faced criticism about fees of up to 30% which it charges on in-app transactions.""Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA.""Complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice — potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps — warrant careful scrutiny.""Shares of Apple were down 0.5% in premarket trading Thursday. Tech shares were clobbered Wednesday amid concerns on Wall Street over rising U.S. bond yields.Britain's competition probe into Apple follows similar moves from the European Union. Last year, the EU Commission launched antitrust investigations into Apple's App Store rules and its Apple Pay mobile wallet. The CMA said it would continue to coordinate closely with the EU and other regulators, despite Britain having formally left the bloc last year.An Apple spokesperson said the firm would work with the CMA to address its concerns.""We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish,"" the spokesperson said.""The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place — applied fairly and equally to all developers — to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent.""Large U.S. tech companies are facing mounting antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world. The EU is looking to clamp down on Big Tech with sweeping digital markets and services reforms. The U.K., meanwhile, has plans of its own to introduce new digital rules.Epic Games, creator of the popular video game Fortnite, has been particularly vocal in its criticism of Apple. Epic claims the iPhone maker's App Store rules are anti-competitive and has particularly taken issue with the 30% cut that Apple takes from developers for in-app purchases.Last month, Epic filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with the EU. It's filed similar lawsuits with competition regulators in the U.S., Australia and the U.K.Epic's fight with Apple began after it released an updated version of Fortnite that allowed players to bypass Apple's payment system to buy digital goods. Apple subsequently delisted the game, which was met with legal action from Epic hours later. Google was also sued by Epic after it removed the Android version of Fortnite.Spotify and Match Group have also complained about Apple's policies.""The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority joins an ever-growing list of regulators to open an investigation into Apple's App Store practices,"" a Spotify spokesperson said.""We welcome this and hope to see swift action because Apple's anticompetitive behavior is harmful to not just Spotify but to app developers and consumers everywhere around the world.""Got a confidential news tip?

162,Chinese drone maker launches first immersive drone kit,Hardware,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-03/Chinese-drone-maker-launches-first-immersive-drone-kit--YkWv511Fhm/index.html," Share CopiedDJI FPV. /DJIChinese drone maker DJI has introduced a kit that allows users to take nimble virtual first-person flights and experience from the drone's perspective on what ""fly like a bird"" means. The Shenzhen-based company on Tuesday released its latest product line, claiming the new suite of equipment – including a drone, a controller, a goggle, among other accessories – ""reinvents"" the drone-flying experience. With the help of goggles and the single-hand motion controller, even an amateur user can remotely navigate the 420-gram racing drone to explore the skies. The drone is mounted with a camera that's capable of taking 4K videos. It also transmits high-definition live stream video back to the goggle at a range up to 10 kilometers, said the company. ""It can fly like a racer, hover like a traditional drone, accelerate like a homebuilt project and stop faster than any of them,"" DJI Europe's Creative Director Ferdinand Wolf said in a press statement. The drone is also embedded with an array of flight safety features that command the drone to make emergency brake or hovering moves. It is also armed with GPS-based geofencing to advise pilots of airspace restrictions and potential hazards, to warn users when manned aircraft are nearby, said the company. The worldwide commercial drone market was valued at almost $1.6 billion in 2019, and the sales could reach $8.5 billion by 2027, according to Fortune Business Insights. ""An increase in demand for unmanned aerial vehicles and their components due to high adoption in various industries is projected to spur market growth during the forecast period,"" said the report.The global COVID-19 pandemic could also create demand for drone makers as they are tasked to conduct air delivery to reduce human contact, according to the research firm.""The successful design for small remote-controlled aircraft has now become the most popular commercial industry from the past few years around the world,"" said the report. Copyright © 2020 CGTN.

165,"AT&amp;T promised a TV revolution — instead, we got a giant mess",Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310994/att-directv-uverse-spinoff-sale-television-hbo-max-deal,"Filed under:The DirecTV debacle came at a high human costLast week, AT&T announced it would be spinning off its TV business — including DirecTV, AT&T TV, and U-verse — in a deal it claimed would greatly benefit the company’s customers, employees, and shareholders. The deal provides AT&T with a $7.8 billion cash infusion to pay down debt and recent wireless spectrum purchases, and a 70 percent stake in the “new” DirecTV. But it also values the entire operation at around $16.25 billion, a massive loss from the $67 billion AT&T paid just a few years earlier for just DirecTV alone.“It’s fair to say that some aspects of the transaction have not played out as we had planned,” AT&T said of the deal, trying to put a good face on a more than $50 billion loss, “such as pay TV households in the US declining at a faster pace across the industry than anticipated when we announced the deal back in 2014.”It’s the latest chapter in AT&T’s long journey to transform from a boring old telecom into a dominant player in new media. Six years, 54,858 layoffs, two mergers, and nearly $175 billion later, AT&T is only marginally closer to streaming TV dominance. Instead, customers and employees are footing the bill for their bad decisions in the form of TV rate hikes and layoffs that show no sign of slowing down.Wall Street telecom analyst Craig Moffett surveyed the wreckage in a research note to investors, in which he noted the deal does little to tackle $157 billion in remaining AT&T debt. “AT&T’s DirecTV is inarguably one of the worst acquisitions of all time,” Moffett said. “They bought it for $67 billion in 2013. Even at the overly-generous valuation reported last night, they are exiting at a price 76% below what they paid for it just seven years ago.”It wasn’t supposed to be this way. AT&T executives once dreamed of creating an online video juggernaut that could rival the power of Google and Facebook in the online advertising space, using must-watch HBO content — and AT&T’s wireless network — as the glue holding the effort together. That dream fueled the DirecTV acquisition in 2014 (which executives promised would deliver “enhanced innovation” and “significant benefits for consumers”) as well as the Time Warner acquisition in 2018 (which we were told would usher forth the “next wave of innovation in converging media and communications”).But for AT&T, a company built on the back of the far less competitive and innovative US broadband sector, that dream proved hard to realize. First, AT&T unveiled so many discordant TV brands across both its traditional cable and streaming platforms, even the company’s own employees got confused. The company then attempted to dig out from under its massive merger debt load by imposing repeated price increases on subscribers already tired from years of relentless rate hikes. A discounted $15-per-month streaming TV offering, used to lure regulators into approving the Time Warner merger, quickly disappeared as soon as the merger ink had dried. AT&T’s customers, paying an average of $130.55 per month for television, quickly revolted. As a result, AT&T has lost 8 million pay TV subscribers in just the last four years. But the casualties from AT&T’s merger go well beyond the financial.As streaming shifted from pesky upstart to the mainstream, younger consumers began viewing traditional satellite television as an antiquated relic of a bygone era. As a result, companies like Dish Network and DirecTV were particularly hard hit by the cord-cutting revolution.Yet, in 2017, company executives made repeated television appearances promising that if the Trump administration passed its tax relief plan, the company would respond with billions in investment and thousands of “high-paying, really good jobs with great benefits.” Similar promises were made by both AT&T and unions ahead of each merger. After receiving an estimated $42 billion in tax cuts from the Trump administration, the company has instead laid off an estimated 54,858 employees since 2017. AT&T imposed additional layoffs at Time Warner properties, including HBO and DC, and shuttered businesses like DC’s popular Vertigo label in a desperate bid to cut costs.Elsewhere, AT&T remained under steady fire for failing to upgrade its aging DSL lines to fiber, a problem particularly pronounced in marginalized neighborhoods. Attention and resources that may have helped address the country’s stubborn digital divide were instead funneled into an aggressive proposal designed largely to appease shareholders, consumer groups say. “[Former AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson] was getting a ton of pressure to generate cash flow to support the dividend, but also pressure to increase the stock price,” S. Derek Turner, Research Director at consumer group Free Press, told The Verge. “Buying DirecTV on credit did that. The deal benefited whomever held AT&T’s stock as a dividend source. The customers and potential customers in AT&T service areas didn’t benefit.”But even some investors grew angry with AT&T’s “growth for growth’s sake” strategy. Activist investors at Elliott Management penned a letter to AT&T in late 2019 complaining the company had spent nearly $200 billion to become “a sprawling collection of businesses battling well-funded competitors,” instead of focusing on core competencies like wireless. The end result of AT&T’s ambition wasn’t entirely fruitless: HBO Max, the latest in a long line of attempted streaming TV brand refreshes, could still challenge other rising streaming services like Disney Plus or Comcast’s Peacock. But however successful HBO Max winds up being, it’s a product that shouldn’t have cost $200 billion and 55,000 jobs to create. Ironically, AT&T’s failure comes despite the fact that it spent the better part of a decade lobbying to tilt the regulatory playing field in its favor, culminating in the company’s successful 2017 assault on net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission’s consumer protection authority. But even abusing broadband usage caps to give itself a tactical advantage over streaming competitors didn’t help. Ultimately, no amount of money or political power could buy the TV dominance the company’s executives envisioned. And as AT&T struggles to offload the mammoth debt load created by its ambition, employees and customers continue to foot the bill.A newsletter about computers"
166,Microsoft has blamed a Chinese cyber-espionage group for attacks on its mail server software.,Security,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56261516,"Microsoft has blamed a Chinese cyber-espionage group for attacks on its mail server software. The tech giant said the hackers belonged to a state-backed group, which was a ""highly skilled and sophisticated actor"". In a blog post, Microsoft said the hacking campaign made use of four previously undetected vulnerabilities in different versions of the software. The security flaws allowed the hackers to remotely access email inboxes.  Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Centre attributed the attacks with ""high confidence"" to Hafnium, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China.  It based its conclusion on ""observed victimology, tactics and procedures"".Microsoft said Hafnium targets infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions and defence contractors.  Policy think tanks and non-governmental groups have also been targeted. This is the eighth time in the past 12 months that Microsoft has publicly accused nation-state groups targeting institutions critical to civil society. Although Hafnium is based in China, it conducts its operations primarily from leased virtual private servers in the US, Microsoft said. Separately, Microsoft said it has observed Hafnium interacting with users of its Office 365 suite.The company has released software updates aimed at addressing the vulnerabilities in its software. Microsoft said the attack was in no way related to the SolarWinds attack, which hit US government agencies late last year. While many US tech firms have had a tumultuous relationship with the Chinese government, Microsoft has maintained a mainland presence since 1992. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Microsoft's business-oriented social media platform LinkedIn is still accessible in China. So too is its search engine Bing, although locally-grown Baidu dominates the search market. The company also runs a centre for artificial intelligence research in China.

Instead of amending its federal lawsuit against Amazon Web Services after a judge ripped its request for an injunction, Parler is trying a different course. It dropped that suit and filed a new one in Washington state court — this time alleging violations of its rights as a consumer.The legal fight started after AWS suspended Parler's web hosting service in the days following the Jan 6. violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, an event which has been widely reported to have been coordinated on social media. AWS said it flagged nearly a hundred examples of posts meant to incite or encourage violence and it was terminating its service because Parler didn't have policies or procedures in place to moderate such content.The day after its site went dark, Parler sued claiming the real reason for its shutdown was that AWS is conspiring with Twitter to quash potential competitors in the social media space and asked for an injunction that would bar the company from terminating its service. U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein denied the motion finding that Parler didn't show a likelihood of prevailing on its claims and rejected ""any suggestion that the public interest favors requiring AWS to host the incendiary speech that the record shows some of Parler’s users have engaged in.""Parler had initially intended to amend its complaint, but the company instead chose to move the fight to state court — centering the bulk of its suit on the Washington Consumer Protection Act.Its new suit starts by noting the size and market power of AWS and its parent company, specifically mentioning that Amazon's almost $1.7 trillion valuation is ""about the annual GDP of Russia"" and AWS has about a third of the global cloud service business.""When companies are this big, it’s easy to be a bully,"" writes attorney Angelo Calfo in the complaint.""Many start-up companies that have appeared to be a threat to Amazon and AWS have felt their wrath. Plaintiff Parler LLC is merely the latest casualty—a victim of Amazon’s efforts to destroy an up-and-coming technology company through deceptive, defamatory, anticompetitive, and bad faith conduct.""Parler claims it had a positive relationship with AWS and the company hadn't shared any major concerns over content moderation during the first two years they were in business.""In fact, just two days before the termination announcement, AWS had assured Paler that it was 'okay' as to problematic content,"" writes Calfo. ""Parler relied on this representation and similar representations from AWS, to the detriment of its own business.""The social site insists nothing significantly had changed in its moderation procedures, but says in the weeks leading up to its shutdown AWS ""signed a major new contract"" with Twitter. After then-president Donald Trump was booted from Twitter, Parler expected him to come to its site and bring millions of followers with him.Parler alleges that it would have become ""a huge threat to Twitter in the microblogging market"" and that's why AWS pulled the plug. The company also claims AWS is ""secretly selling Parler user data.""The complaint also does a deep dive into how Parler operates and contrasts that with the major social media sites. It argues its users are less likely to find themselves in echo chambers because it doesn't use artificial intelligence to ""encourage its users to see and interact with like-minded folks."" According to the complaint, there also aren't any groups and sending direct messages requires a verified account. (It's verification isn't a blue check system for high-profile users like Twitter. It's an identity confirmation that requires uploading a selfie and a driver's license or other ID.)It also runs through a laundry list of examples of violent content on Twitter and Facebook that went ignored and claims there's no evidence its site played a role in coordinating the Jan. 6 attack.Parler is alleging multiple violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and argues that the AWS Customer Agreement is a contract of adhesion, a take it or leave it deal that ""unfairly, deceptively, and unconscionably advantages AWS and harms its customers."" Parler says the contract is drafted in a way that forces its customers to breach it ""en masse,"" which gives AWS the ability to terminate just about any agreement ""for cause.""The site's other claims include breach of contract, violation of Seattle's fair contracting practices ordinance and defamation — claiming that AWS (or one of its employees) leaked the termination letter to Buzzfeed knowing that the reasons listed within were merely pretextual.Here's Amazon's statement in response to the complaint, which is embedded below: ""There is no merit to these claims. AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, as shown by the evidence in Parler’s federal lawsuit, it was clear that there was significant content on Parler that encouraged and incited violence against others, which is a violation of our terms of service. Further, Parler was unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which coupled with an increase in this type of dangerous violent content, led to our suspension of their services.”

This means the C40’s range will be extended over time with software upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Henrik Green said.Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.Last month, Ford Motor Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.In November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, said its models would be all electric by 2030.Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, employment in the car industry is expected to shrink.Volvo CEO Samuelsson said that industry-wide, electrification will mostly affect engine plants and auto suppliers providing everything from oil filters to fuel injectors and spark plugs.“Those are a lot of jobs of course,” he said. “But overall I don’t think there will be a big difference.”Volvo said it will “radically reduce” the complexity of its model line-up and provide customers with transparent pricing.The carmaker’s global network of 2,400 traditional bricks-and-mortar dealers will remain open to service vehicles and to help customers make online orders.So far Volvo has not been affected by a pandemic-fueled global semiconductor chip shortage that has temporarily shut a number of assembly plants, which Samuelsson said was thanks to constant communication with suppliers.“So far, knock on wood, we have not had to stop any assembly line,” he said. “But it could happen any day.”Reporting By Nick Carey; editing by Barbara Lewis, Gerry Doyle and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

170,"SpaceX’s Starship prototype flies to 32,000 feet and sticks the landing in third flight test",Space,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/spacexs-starship-prototype-flies-to-32000-feet-and-sticks-the-landing-in-third-flight-test/,"SpaceX has launched SN10 — the tenth iteration of its current prototype series of Starship, the heavy-lift reusable spacecraft it’s developing. Starship SN10 took off from Boca Chica, Texas, where SpaceX is developing the vehicle. It flew to a height of roughly 10 km, or 32,000 feet, before performing a maneuver to re-orient itself for a friction-assisted landing descent.Unlike the last two Starship prototypes to fly this high, however, the roughly six-minute flight did not end in a fireball [UPDATE: Well, not immediately. The rocket did blow up while stationary on the landing pad a few minutes after landing, potentially due to a leak]. Instead, it completed its landing flip maneuver as intended and slowed itself for a soft touchdown, with the rocket remaining vertical and intact afterwards.This was a fantastic outcome, and a nominal one in all regards according to SpaceX’s livestream. But why the prior explosions to get to this point? That’s partly down to the way in which it has been doing its development of this vehicle. All rocket development includes unexpected events and sub-optimal outcomes, but SpaceX has a couple of things at work that mean is efforts are subject to unusual scrutiny versus your average spaceship manufacturer.SpaceX’s Starship prototype once again flies to great heights, and again explodes on landingFirst, it’s doing this out in the open — the Boca Chica facility is basically just a couple small buildings, some concrete pads, some storage tanks and some scaffolding. It’s extremely close to a public roadway (which is closed during testing, while the surrounding area is evacuated), and people can and do just drive up and set up cameras to film what’s going on. That’s not at all how legacy rocket makers have typically done things.Second, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has been adamant that SpaceX pursue a development strategy of rapid iteration and prototyping with Starship’s development. That has meant it’s manufacturing and assembling Starship prototypes simultaneously, making small changes as it goes, rather than stepping back after each test and doing a prolonged, multi-month analysis before proceeding with building and flying another version.A launch attempt earlier in the day was cut short after a brief engine fire, when instrument readings from the rocket showed a slightly high thrust value that violated what Musk termed “conservative.” The fix that SpaceX instituted was actually adjusting the limit higher in order to avoid the abort initiation.SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finaleNo doubt the company will do an investigation into the cause of the explosion that followed the successful flight and landing maneuver, but the test was still successful in all the ways that matter most for SpaceX at this stage of development. Next up for Starship is likely increasing the height of these test flights. Eventually, the goal is to reach orbit, of course, but SpaceX is likely to try a few launches that remain atmospheric but far exceed this one before it attempts making that trip.Early Stage is the premier “how-to” event for startup entrepreneurs and investors. You’ll hear firsthand how some of the most successful founders and VCs build their businesses, raise money and manage their portfolios. We’ll cover every aspect of company building: Fundraising, recruiting, sales, legal, PR, marketing and brand building.

171,Amazon's GameOn screen recording app comes to iOS,Software,https://www.engadget.com/amazon-gameon-ios-214108561.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618,"In November, Amazon announced GameOn, an app for recording short, shareable clips from your favorite mobile games. Initially, it was only available on Android. But as spotted by TechCrunch, if you own an iPhone or iPad and live in the US, you can now download GameOn on iOS as well.GameOn currently works with more than 1,000 mobile games, including perennial favorites like PUBG Mobile and Crossy Road 2, in addition to more recent hits like Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. It allows you to capture clips that come in anywhere between 30 seconds to five minutes in length. It's also possible to use the app to edit any videos you capture and add live commentary. You can even use it to record your reactions to something that happened in-game.The idea here is to make it easy to share content like highlight reels and walkthroughs. To that end, you can watch videos other people capture directly through the app. Naturally, you can also post any clips you record through the app on Facebook, Twitter and the like. Please enter a valid email address"
172,"Parler sues Amazon again, after dropping original lawsuit",Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AV1J0?il=0,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Elizabeth Culliford, Jonathan Stempel3 Min Read(Reuters) - Parler, a social media app popular among right-wing groups, filed a new lawsuit accusing Amazon.com Inc of trying to destroy its business following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.The lawsuit seeking a variety of damages, including triple damages for anticompetitive conduct, was filed in Washington state court on Tuesday, two weeks after Parler returned online following a monthlong absence.Parler went dark when Amazon suspended its web-hosting services following the Capitol attack, saying Parler had failed to effectively moderate violent content on its website.The new lawsuit came as Parler voluntarily dismissed a federal lawsuit against Amazon over that suspension on Tuesday, the deadline to file an amended complaint.Parler’s new lawsuit accused Amazon of a slew of contractual violations, and like the original case said Amazon shut it down to benefit a new client, Twitter Inc.The app said it was worth $1 billion and about to seek funding when Seattle-based Amazon pulled the plug, costing it tens of millions of users and hundreds of millions of dollars of annual ad revenue.“When companies are this big, it’s easy to be a bully,” Parler said, calling itself “a victim of Amazon’s efforts to destroy an up-and-coming technology company through deceptive, defamatory, anticompetitive, and bad faith conduct.”An Amazon spokesman said the new claims have no merit, and that it “provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum.”Parler has said there was a lack of evidence it helped incite the Capitol riot, but the judge in the federal case on Jan. 21 refused to order Amazon to resume services.The relaunch effectively mooted Parler’s claim that Amazon put it out of business.Parler has said its new platform was built on “sustainable, independent technology.”SkySilk, a Los Angeles-based company, said it was providing private cloud infrastructure.Google also removed the Parler app from its Play Store and Apple removed it from its App Store.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru, and Elizabeth Culliford and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Aurora Ellis, Arun Koyyur and David GregorioOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

173,"GM is close to building a second EV battery factory in the US, report says",Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee,"Filed under:The plant will be built with South Korea’s LG ChemGeneral Motors is considering building a second battery factory in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reports, in order to ramp up its production of electric vehicles in the interest of becoming a completely carbon neutral company by the year 2040. The factory would be built in collaboration with LG Chem, the South Korean battery maker that is already working with GM on a battery factory in northern Ohio. According to the Journal, the second facility is likely to be located in Tennessee, though a final location has yet to be selected. A spokesperson for GM confirmed that a second factory is being discussed with LG Chem, and a decision is expected sometime in the first half of 2021. GM announced the construction of its first battery factory in December 2019. The automaker set up a joint venture with LG Chem, with the two companies committing to spend $2.3 billion on a new facility located in Lordstown, Ohio. GM, the largest automaker in North America based on sales, is increasingly staking its future on electric vehicles. The company has vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. GM even redesigned its logo to look more like an electrical plug to emphasize its pivot to battery-powered vehicles. LG Chem is a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and their respective parent companies Volkswagen Group and Daimler. Many of these automotive giants have plans to either build their own battery factories in the future or partner with suppliers to build batteries together, like Tesla does with Panasonic. Tesla has also announced plans to bring its future battery production in-house, and it recently announced a deal with a major producer of nickel. But until those factories are built, they’re at the mercy of suppliers like LG Chem.The auto industry as a whole is slowly shifting to electric vehicles, and if the US wants to compete with the rest of the world, it needs to ramp up its supply of locally produced EV batteries in addition to other crucial components in the supply chain. SK Innovation, another South Korean company that supplies batteries to Volkswagen and Ford, began construction on its second US-based factory in July in Georgia with production aimed for 2023. President Joe Biden recently signed a series of executive orders aimed at combating climate change, including the electrification of the federal government’s fleet of vehicles. The new administration has provided an opportunity for GM to fully embrace the electrification of its vehicle lineup as well as shrug off its past support of former President Donald Trump’s effort to allow passenger vehicles to pollute more.A newsletter about computers"
174,"U.S. Navy is Liable for Mass Software Piracy, Appeals Court Rules",Software,https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-navy-is-liable-for-mass-software-piracy-appeals-court-rules-210302/,"
Home > Lawsuits > 

 
The United States Navy is liable for a mass copyright infringement. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with the German software company Bitmanagement, which accused the Navy of copying software without permission. Bitmanagement claimed more than $500 million in damages, but the final amount has yet to be determined.
The US Government regularly cautions foreign countries for their lacking copyright policies. However, it has its own issues as well.Five years ago the US Navy was sued for mass copyright infringement and accused of causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The lawsuit was filed by the German company Bitmanagement. It’s not a typical piracy case in the sense that software was downloaded from shady sources. However, the end result is the same.It all started in 2011, when the US Navy began testing the company’s 3D virtual reality application ‘BS Contact’. After some testing, the Navy installed the software across its network, assuming that it had permission to do so.This turned out to be a crucial misunderstanding. Bitmanagement said it never authorized this type of use and when it heard that the Navy had installed the software on 558,466 computers, the company took legal action.In a complaint filed at the United States Court of Federal Claims in 2016, the German company accused the US Navy of mass copyright infringement and demanded damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.The dispute started when the US Navy decided that it would like to run the software across its entire network. This meant that it would be installed on hundreds of thousands of computers, with “Flexera” software keeping track of the number of simultaneous users.Bitmanagement didn’t offer such a license by default, so the Navy requested this option separately. These requests took place through a reseller, Planet 9 Studios, which complicated matters. After several back and forths, the Navy was convinced that it had permission, but Bitmanagement later disagreed.The problem for the Court was that the Navy and Bitmanagement didn’t sign a contract, so there was no direct permission given. This meant that the Court had to review the conversations and exchanges that took place, to determine which side was right.After reviewing all evidence, the Federal Claims court eventually sided with the US Navy, dismissing the copyright infringement claim. However, this wasn’t the end of it. Bitmanagement maintained that the Navy clearly committed mass copyright infringement and the company took the matter to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, with success. In an order issued a few days ago, the Appeals Court agrees with pretty much all conclusions of the Federal Claims Court. The evidence indeed shows that Bitmanagement ‘authorized’ the U.S. Navy’s copying of BS Contact Geo across its network. While this wasn’t formalized in an official contract, the Navy had an “implied license.”Based on this reasoning, the lower court dismissed the case. However, the Appeals Court notes that the evidence doesn’t stop there. The implied license also required the Navy to “Flexwrap” the software to track simultaneous users. That never happened.“We do not disturb the Claims Court’s findings. The Claims Court ended its analysis of this case prematurely, however, by failing to consider whether the Navy complied with the terms of the implied license,” the Appeals Court writes.“The implied license was conditioned on the Navy using a license-tracking software, Flexera, to ‘FlexWrap’ the program and monitor the number of simultaneous users. It is undisputed that the Navy failed to effectively FlexWrap the copies it made,” the Court adds.This failure on the Navy’s part makes the US Government liable for copyright infringement. The Navy simply wasn’t allowed to copy the software on hundreds of thousands of computers without tracking its use.“Such unauthorized copying is copyright infringement. We therefore vacate the Claims Court’s judgment and remand for a determination of damages,” the Appeals Court clarifies. This means that the dismissal is off the table and the Navy is liable for copyright infringement after all. The matter will now go back to the Federal Claims court, to determine the appropriate damages amount. In the original complaint, Bitmanagement argued that it is entitled to at least $596,308,103 in unpaid licensing fees, so this could turn out to be an expensive error.—A copy of the order issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is available here (pdf)LawsuitsThere are 12 comments.

175,Comcast hides upload speeds deep inside its infuriating ordering system,Business,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/comcast-hides-upload-speeds-deep-inside-its-infuriating-ordering-system/,"Front page layoutSite themeSign up or login to join the discussions!

Comcast just released a 2020 Network Performance Data report with stats on how much Internet usage rose during the pandemic, and it said that upload use is growing faster than download use. ""Peak downstream traffic in 2020 increased approximately 38 percent over 2019 levels and peak upstream traffic increased approximately 56 percent over 2019 levels,"" Comcast said.But while upload use on Comcast's network quickly grows—driven largely by videoconferencing among people working and learning at home—the nation's largest home-Internet provider with over 30 million customers advertises its speed tiers as if uploading doesn't exist. Comcast's 56 percent increase in upstream traffic made me wonder if the company will increase upload speeds any time soon, so I checked out Comcast's Xfinity.com site today to see the current upload speeds. Getting that information was even more difficult than I expected.The Xfinity website advertises cable-Internet plans with download speeds starting at 25Mbps without mentioning that upstream speeds are just a fraction of the downstream ones. I went through Comcast's online ordering system today and found no mention of upload speeds anywhere. Even clicking ""pricing & other info"" and ""view plan details"" links to read the fine print on various Internet plans didn't reveal upload speeds.Even after adding a plan to the cart and going through most of the checkout process, I could not find any mention of upload speeds. I got to the point where you have to enter credit card information to continue, so I initially stopped there. I later confirmed that Comcast's ordering system will show upload speeds after it checks whether your credit card is valid, in the final page where you submit an order.I've long known that it's difficult to find upload speeds on Comcast's website, but I'm not sure exactly when it became virtually impossible. There were complaints about this very problem on Comcast's customer support forums in 2020 and in 2019, though. ""What is my upload speed now? No where in the world can I find documentation,"" one customer asked. The answer was that existing customers can find upload speeds for their own plan in their account settings after logging in and navigating to the correct section.But that does not help people who are signing up for service and want to find out what upload speeds they'll get or compare upload speeds of different plans. Even the Xfinity.com comparison tool that lets you compare details of different plans doesn't reveal their upload speeds. The absence of upload speeds from Comcast's website is so thorough that it is clearly a deliberate attempt to keep customers in the dark. This gallery shows how the Comcast Xfinity website displays Internet plans without mentioning upload speeds and continues that tactic through nearly the entire checkout process:Thankfully, the third-party website CableTV.com lists both download and upload speeds, showing that Comcast's 25Mbps download plan comes with 3Mbps uploads; the 100Mbps and 200Mbps download plans both have 5Mbps uploads; the 300Mbps download plan has 10Mbps uploads; the 600Mbps plan has 15Mbps uploads; and the 1Gbps download (1.2Gbps in some areas) comes with 35Mbps:Comcast's website does list the 35Mbps upload speeds for the gigabit plan at this page, but I couldn't find anything similar for Comcast's other cable-Internet plans. Comcast also offers a fiber-to-the-home service with 2Gbps speeds both downstream and upstream. But Comcast's residential fiber requires installation charges of up to $500, and the service costs $300 a month, which is more than three times as much as the gigabit-cable plan that has 35Mbps downloads.

I contacted Comcast today with two primary questions: is there any way to find upload speeds on Comcast's website before submitting an order for Internet service, and does Comcast have any plans to raise its cable upload speeds?Comcast's answer on where to find upstream speeds was as follows:Our network report shows that, despite the growth in upstream traffic in 2020, patterns remain highly asymmetrical as downstream volumes were 14x higher than upstream throughout 2020. Our website reflects the way customers use the Internet with downstream overwhelmingly dominating usage, but upstream speeds are included in your cart and are visible upon check out when you submit your order.Despite Comcast claiming that ""upstream speeds are included in your cart,"" I could find no evidence of this. Adding a Comcast Internet plan to the cart and then clicking the cart icon brought me to an ordering page that does not mention upload speeds. I confirmed this behavior on Xfinity.com in both Chrome and Safari.I circled back to the Comcast spokesperson and asked what exact steps I need to take to make upload speeds show up in the cart. It turns out the upload speeds never show up in the cart at all unless you define ""cart"" to include the entire ordering process. Comcast told us the upload speeds will finally appear ""when you are at the step when you review your order.""Despite my earlier reluctance to enter my credit card information for service I am not ordering, I finally did so to check whether this is accurate. I submitted my address, phone number, and credit card information, and I clicked ""Next."" This triggered a step in which Comcast's system checked to see whether I had entered a valid credit card. I accidentally entered a recently expired card number, so Comcast's system ""declined"" my card and made me re-enter it. After I entered a card number that Comcast could charge, I finally got to this page, where the 300Mbps download-plan's 10Mbps upload speeds are shown:At this page, with Comcast having already verified your card, you can view upload speeds and decide whether to submit the order or exit the ordering system. The part of Comcast's statement that upload speeds are ""visible upon check out when you submit your order"" is thus accurate. But refusing to tell a prospective customer what they're paying for until after they submit credit card information is simply ridiculous. You can probably get upload speeds earlier by asking a Comcast rep in an online chat or phone call, but that shouldn't be necessary.Update: After digging through Comcast's list of customer agreements, policies, and disclosures, I found a now-outdated network management page that includes download and upload speeds. It appears to be the newest such list available on Comcast's website, but it was published on August 19, 2019 and the listed speeds don't match Comcast's current offerings.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Google lifted the ban last week.Democratic and Republican digital strategists have argued that such bans were overly broad and failed to combat the issue of organic misinformation on the platforms.Earlier on Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) issued a statement criticizing Facebook for not committing to a clear date to end the ban, saying the freeze had made it harder for campaigns and organizations to reach voters.Facebook, which noted in its blog post that its systems do not distinguish between political and electoral ads and “social issue” ads, said it would look in the coming months at what other changes to its ads might be needed.Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford in New York, Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

177,The Justice in Policing Act Does Not Do Enough to Reign in Body-Worn Cameras,Politics,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/justice-policing-act-does-not-do-enough-reign-body-worn-cameras,"Reformers often tout police use of body-worn cameras (BWCs) as a way to prevent law enforcement misconduct. But, far too often, this technology becomes one more tool in a toolbox already overflowing with surveillance technology that spies on civilians. Worse, because police often control when BWCs are turned on and how the footage is stored, BWCs often fail to do the one thing they were intended to do: record video of how police interact with the public. So EFF opposes BWCs absent strict safeguards.While it takes some useful steps toward curbing nefarious ways that police use body-worn cameras, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, H.R. 1280, does not do enough. It places important limits on how federal law enforcement officials use BWCs. And it is a step forward compared to last year’s version: it bans federal officials from applying face surveillance technology to any BWC footage. However, H.R. 1280 still falls short: it funds BWCs for state and local police, but does not apply the same safeguards that the bill applies to federal officials. We urge amendments to this bill as detailed below. Otherwise, these federally-funded BWCs will augment law enforcement’s already excessive surveillance capabilities. At a minimum, H.R. 1280 must be amended to extend the face surveillance ban it mandates for federal BWCs, to federally-funded BWCs employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. As has been our position, BWCs should adhere to the following regulations: Mandated activation of body-worn cameras. Officers must be required to activate their cameras at the start of all investigative encounters with civilians, and leave them on until the encounter ends. Otherwise, officers could subvert any accountability benefits of BWCs by simply turning them off when misconduct is imminent, or not turning them on. In narrow circumstances where civilians have heightened privacy interests (like crime victims and during warrantless home searches), officers should give civilians the option to deactivate BWCs.No political spying with body-worn cameras. Police must not use BWCs to gather information about how people are exercising their First Amendment rights to speak, associate, or practice their religion. Government surveillance chills and deters such protected activity.Retention of body-worn camera footage. All BWC footage should be held for a few months, to allow injured civilians sufficient time to come forward and seek evidence. Then footage should be promptly destroyed, to reduce the risks of data breach, employee misuse, and long-term surveillance of the public. However, if footage depicts an officer’s use of force or an episode subject to a civilian’s complaint, then the footage must be retained for a lengthier period. Officer review of footage. If footage depicts use of force or an episode subject to a civilian complaint, then an officer must not be allowed to review the footage until after they make an initial statement about the event. Given the malleability of human memory, a video can alter or even overwrite a recollection. And some officers might use footage to better “testily,” or stretch the truth about encounters.Public access to footage. If footage depicts a particular person, then that person must have access to it. If footage depicts police use of force, then all members of the general public must have access to it. If a person seeks footage that does not depict them or use of force, then whether they may have access must depend on a weighing by a court of (a) the benefits of disclosure to police accountability, and (b) the costs of disclosure to the privacy of a depicted member of the public. If the footage does not depict police misconduct, then disclosure will rarely have a police accountability benefit. In many cases, blurring of civilian faces might diminish privacy concerns. In no case should footage be withheld on the grounds it is a police investigatory record.Enforcement of these rules. If footage is recorded or retained in violation of these rules, then it must not be admissible in court. If footage is not recorded or retained in violation of these rules, then a civil rights plaintiff or criminal defendant must receive an evidentiary presumption that the missing footage would have helped them. And departments must discipline officers who break these rules.Community control over body-worn cameras. Local police and sheriffs must not acquire or use BWCs, or any other surveillance technology, absent permission from their city council or county board, after ample opportunity for residents to make their voices heard. This is commonly called community control over police surveillance (CCOPS). EFF supported a California law (A.B. 1215) that placed a three-year moratorium on use of face surveillance with BWCs. Likewise, EFF in 2019, 2020, and 2021 joined scores of privacy and civil rights groups in opposing any federal use of face surveillance, and also any federal funding of state and local face surveillance. So we are pleased with Section 374 of H.R. 1280, which states: “No camera or recording device authorized or required to be used under this part may be equipped with or employ facial recognition technology, and footage from such a camera or recording device may not be subjected to facial recognition technology.” We are also pleased with Section 3051, which says that federal grant funds for state and local programs “may not be used for expenses related to facial recognition technology.” Both of these provisions validate civil society and over-policed communities’ long-standing assertion that government use of face recognition is dangerous and must be banned. However, this bill does not go far enough. EFF firmly supports a full ban of all government use of face recognition technology. At a minimum, H.R. 1280 must be amended to extend the face surveillance ban it mandates for federal BWCs, to federally-funded BWCs employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. For body-worn cameras to be a small part of a solution, rather than part of the problem, their operation and footage storage must be heavily regulated, and they must used solely to record video of how police interact with the public, and not serve as trojan horses for increased surveillance.The third-party cookie is dying, and Google is trying to create its replacement.

178,Brave takes on Google with privacy-focused search engine - The browser maker also intends to pay people for using its new search engine.,Business,https://www.cnet.com/news/brave-takes-on-google-with-privacy-focused-search-engine/,"The browser maker also intends to pay people for using its new search engine.Browser maker Brave has acquired a search engine project that prioritizes user privacy, a distinction it hopes will set it apart from Google, the undisputed leader in internet search. On Wednesday, Brave said it had purchased Tailcat, which was developed by Cliqz, a privacy-minded subsidiary of Germany's Hubert Burda Media. Tailcat, which Burda shuttered in 2020, was designed to show results without logging user search activity or building a profile. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but Burda now is a Brave shareholder.Brave plans eventually to show search ads through Brave Search, as the Tailcat technology is now called. Brave opened up a waiting list Wednesday so beta testers can try it out in coming weeks, with general availability scheduled for late spring or summer.The startup hopes to pay users for seeing the ads, like it does with its flagship browser. Brave's existing browser-based ad system pays 70% of ad revenue to Brave users who opt into the system, called Brave Rewards.""If we get to that promised land of our own automated search ad system, then we will give the user at least what we make,"" Chief Executive Brendan Eich said.Brave is unlikely to dethrone Google search anytime soon. But Tailcat could show there is room for financial success with a business that puts privacy first. The Brave browser has grown steadily since its initial release in 2016. Eich forecast Brave will have as many as 50 million monthly users at the end of the year, double the 25 million users it has now. It doesn't release financial information, but its revenue has grown by a factor of 28 over the last 16 months and it now employs 115 people.Of course, going up against Google is an enormous undertaking. The search giant accounts for more than 90% of search queries, according to analytics firm StatCounter. Microsoft's Bing is a distant second with less than 3%. Other companies like Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and StartPage repackage Bing and Google search results. Two decades ago, Google rose to a commanding lead because its algorithms, including the seminal PageRank technology created by Google co-founder Larry Page, offer fast, relevant results. Its AdWords system, which shows advertisements alongside search results, remains a money-minting machine.Brave Search starts at a disadvantage because it has a smaller index of the web than Google's. Brave will try to overcome that obstacle by supplementing algorithms that assess relevance with anonymous data from Brave users themselves.Brave can do that by analyzing data the browser gathers on users' searches and the links they click, information that can be shared anonymously. Cliqz hired external security researchers to test the system, Eich said, and is confident search data can't be traced back to any individual.The company's new search service will still rely on Google's expertise to a degree. In Eich's view, wholesale copying of Google's full search results for a given search query is inappropriate. But tracking the link people click from among those results is ""OK,"" he said, as long as it's done anonymously and with users' permission. Brave Search will only gather data from users who opt in, Eich said.Many companies use privacy as part of their sales pitch, and Google is a frequent target. However, with changes to people's privacy priorities and regulatory pressure, Google is changing its ways. On Wednesday, it said that starting next year, it'll stop tracking individuals as they visit different websites. The executive who made the announcement was David Temkin, director of product management for ads privacy and trust at Google. Previously he was Brave's chief product officer.Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read.

179,Google’s FLoC Is a Terrible Idea,Privacy,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea,"The third-party cookie is dying, and Google is trying to create its replacement. No one should mourn the death of the cookie as we know it. For more than two decades, the third-party cookie has been the lynchpin in a shadowy, seedy, multi-billion dollar advertising-surveillance industry on the Web; phasing out tracking cookies and other persistent third-party identifiers is long overdue. However, as the foundations shift beneath the advertising industry, its biggest players are determined to land on their feet. Google is leading the charge to replace third-party cookies with a new suite of technologies to target ads on the Web. And some of its proposals show that it hasn’t learned the right lessons from the ongoing backlash to the surveillance business model. This post will focus on one of those proposals, Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), which is perhaps the most ambitious—and potentially the most harmful. FLoC is meant to be a new way to make your browser do the profiling that third-party trackers used to do themselves: in this case, boiling down your recent browsing activity into a behavioral label, and then sharing it with websites and advertisers. The technology will avoid the privacy risks of third-party cookies, but it will create new ones in the process. It may also exacerbate many of the worst non-privacy problems with behavioral ads, including discrimination and predatory targeting. Google’s pitch to privacy advocates is that a world with FLoC (and other elements of the “privacy sandbox”) will be better than the world we have today, where data brokers and ad-tech giants track and profile with impunity. But that framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and “new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads. We stand at a fork in the road. Behind us is the era of the third-party cookie, perhaps the Web’s biggest mistake. Ahead of us are two possible futures. In one, users get to decide what information to share with each site they choose to interact with. No one needs to worry that their past browsing will be held against them—or leveraged to manipulate them—when they next open a tab. In the other, each user’s behavior follows them from site to site as a label, inscrutable at a glance but rich with meaning to those in the know. Their recent history, distilled into a few bits, is “democratized” and shared with dozens of nameless actors that take part in the service of each web page. Users begin every interaction with a confession: here’s what I’ve been up to this week, please treat me accordingly.Users and advocates must reject FLoC and other misguided attempts to reinvent behavioral targeting. We implore Google to abandon FLoC and redirect its effort towards building a truly user-friendly Web.In 2019, Google presented the Privacy Sandbox, its vision for the future of privacy on the Web. At the center of the project is a suite of cookieless protocols designed to satisfy the myriad use cases that third-party cookies currently provide to advertisers. Google took its proposals to the W3C, the standards-making body for the Web, where they have primarily been discussed in the Web Advertising Business Group, a body made up primarily of ad-tech vendors. In the intervening months, Google and other advertisers have proposed dozens of bird-themed technical standards: PIGIN, TURTLEDOVE, SPARROW, SWAN, SPURFOWL, PELICAN, PARROT… the list goes on. Seriously. Each of the “bird” proposals is designed to perform one of the functions in the targeted advertising ecosystem that is currently done by cookies.FLoC is designed to help advertisers perform behavioral targeting without third-party cookies. A browser with FLoC enabled would collect information about its user’s browsing habits, then use that information to assign its user to a “cohort” or group. Users with similar browsing habits—for some definition of “similar”—would be grouped into the same cohort. Each user’s browser will share a cohort ID, indicating which group they belong to, with websites and advertisers. According to the proposal, at least a few thousand users should belong to each cohort (though that’s not a guarantee).If that sounds dense, think of it this way: your FLoC ID will be like a succinct summary of your recent activity on the Web.Google’s proof of concept used the domains of the sites that each user visited as the basis for grouping people together. It then used an algorithm called SimHash to create the groups. SimHash can be computed locally on each user’s machine, so there’s no need for a central server to collect behavioral data. However, a central administrator could have a role in enforcing privacy guarantees. In order to prevent any cohort from being too small (i.e. too identifying), Google proposes that a central actor could count the number of users assigned each cohort. If any are too small, they can be combined with other, similar cohorts until enough users are represented in each one. For FLoC to be useful to advertisers, a user’s cohort will necessarily reveal information about their behavior.According to the proposal, most of the specifics are still up in the air. The draft specification states that a user’s cohort ID will be available via Javascript, but it’s unclear whether there will be any restrictions on who can access it, or whether the ID will be shared in any other ways. FLoC could perform clustering based on URLs or page content instead of domains; it could also use a federated learning-based system (as the name FLoC implies) to generate the groups instead of SimHash. It’s also unclear exactly how many possible cohorts there will be. Google’s experiment used 8-bit cohort identifiers, meaning that there were only 256 possible cohorts. In practice that number could be much higher; the documentation suggests a 16-bit cohort ID comprising 4 hexadecimal characters. The more cohorts there are, the more specific they will be; longer cohort IDs will mean that advertisers learn more about each user’s interests and have an easier time fingerprinting them.One thing that is specified is duration. FLoC cohorts will be re-calculated on a weekly basis, each time using data from the previous week’s browsing. This makes FLoC cohorts less useful as long-term identifiers, but it also makes them more potent measures of how users behave over time.FLoC is part of a suite intended to bring targeted ads into a privacy-preserving future. But the core design involves sharing new information with advertisers. Unsurprisingly, this also creates new privacy risks. The first issue is fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is the practice of gathering many discrete pieces of information from a user’s browser to create a unique, stable identifier for that browser. EFF’s Cover Your Tracks project demonstrates how the process works: in a nutshell, the more ways your browser looks or acts different from others’, the easier it is to fingerprint. Google has promised that the vast majority of FLoC cohorts will comprise thousands of users each, so a cohort ID alone shouldn’t distinguish you from a few thousand other people like you. However, that still gives fingerprinters a massive head start. If a tracker starts with your FLoC cohort, it only has to distinguish your browser from a few thousand others (rather than a few hundred million). In information theoretic terms, FLoC cohorts will contain several bits of entropy—up to 8 bits, in Google’s proof of concept trial. This information is even more potent given that it is unlikely to be correlated with other information that the browser exposes. This will make it much easier for trackers to put together a unique fingerprint for FLoC users.Google has acknowledged this as a challenge, but has pledged to solve it as part of the broader “Privacy Budget” plan it has to deal with fingerprinting long-term. Solving fingerprinting is an admirable goal, and its proposal is a promising avenue to pursue. But according to the FAQ, that plan is “an early stage proposal and does not yet have a browser implementation.” Meanwhile, Google is set to begin testing FLoC as early as this month.Fingerprinting is notoriously difficult to stop. Browsers like Safari and Tor have engaged in years-long wars of attrition against trackers, sacrificing large swaths of their own feature sets in order to reduce fingerprinting attack surfaces. Fingerprinting mitigation generally involves trimming away or restricting unnecessary sources of entropy—which is what FLoC is. Google should not create new fingerprinting risks until it’s figured out how to deal with existing ones.The second problem is less easily explained away: the technology will share new personal data with trackers who can already identify users. For FLoC to be useful to advertisers, a user’s cohort will necessarily reveal information about their behavior. The project’s Github page addresses this up front:This API democratizes access to some information about an individual’s general browsing history (and thus, general interests) to any site that opts into it. … Sites that know a person’s PII (e.g., when people sign in using their email address) could record and reveal their cohort. This means that information about an individual's interests may eventually become public.As described above, FLoC cohorts shouldn’t work as identifiers by themselves. However, any company able to identify a user in other ways—say, by offering “log in with Google” services to sites around the Internet—will be able to tie the information it learns from FLoC to the user’s profile.Two categories of information may be exposed in this way:This means every site you visit will have a good idea about what kind of person you are on first contact, without having to do the work of tracking you across the web. Moreover, as your FLoC cohort will update over time, sites that can identify you in other ways will also be able to track how your browsing changes. Remember, a FLoC cohort is nothing more, and nothing less, than a summary of your recent browsing activity.You should have a right to present different aspects of your identity in different contexts. If you visit a site for medical information, you might trust it with information about your health, but there’s no reason it needs to know what your politics are. Likewise, if you visit a retail website, it shouldn’t need to know whether you’ve recently read up on treatment for depression. FLoC erodes this separation of contexts, and instead presents the same behavioral summary to everyone you interact with.FLoC is designed to prevent a very specific threat: the kind of individualized profiling that is enabled by cross-context identifiers today. The goal of FLoC and other proposals is to avoid letting trackers access specific pieces of information that they can tie to specific people. As we’ve shown, FLoC may actually help trackers in many contexts. But even if Google is able to iterate on its design and prevent these risks, the harms of targeted advertising are not limited to violations of privacy. FLoC’s core objective is at odds with other civil liberties.The power to target is the power to discriminate. By definition, targeted ads allow advertisers to reach some kinds of people while excluding others. A targeting system may be used to decide who gets to see job postings or loan offers just as easily as it is to advertise shoes. Over the years, the machinery of targeted advertising has frequently been used for exploitation, discrimination, and harm. The ability to target people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, or ability allows discriminatory ads for jobs, housing, and credit. Targeting based on credit history—or characteristics systematically associated with it— enables predatory ads for high-interest loans. Targeting based on demographics, location, and political affiliation helps purveyors of politically motivated disinformation and voter suppression. All kinds of behavioral targeting increase the risk of convincing scams.Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.Google, Facebook, and many other ad platforms already try to rein in certain uses of their targeting platforms. Google, for example, limits advertisers’ ability to target people in “sensitive interest categories.” However, these efforts frequently fall short; determined actors can usually find workarounds to platform-wide restrictions on certain kinds of targeting or certain kinds of ads. Even with absolute power over what information can be used to target whom, platforms are too often unable to prevent abuse of their technology. But FLoC will use an unsupervised algorithm to create its clusters. That means that nobody will have direct control over how people are grouped together. Ideally (for advertisers), FLoC will create groups that have meaningful behaviors and interests in common. But online behavior is linked to all kinds of sensitive characteristics—demographics like gender, ethnicity, age, and income; “big 5” personality traits; even mental health. It is highly likely that FLoC will group users along some of these axes as well. FLoC groupings may also directly reflect visits to websites related to substance abuse, financial hardship, or support for survivors of trauma.Google has proposed that it can monitor the outputs of the system to check for any correlations with its sensitive categories. If it finds that a particular cohort is too closely related to a particular protected group, the administrative server can choose new parameters for the algorithm and tell users’ browsers to group themselves again. This solution sounds both orwellian and sisyphean. In order to monitor how FLoC groups correlate with sensitive categories, Google will need to run massive audits using data about users’ race, gender, religion, age, health, and financial status. Whenever it finds a cohort that correlates too strongly along any of those axes, it will have to reconfigure the whole algorithm and try again, hoping that no other “sensitive categories” are implicated in the new version. This is a much more difficult version of the problem it is already trying, and frequently failing, to solve.In a world with FLoC, it may be more difficult to target users directly based on age, gender, or income. But it won’t be impossible. Trackers with access to auxiliary information about users will be able to learn what FLoC groupings “mean”—what kinds of people they contain—through observation and experiment. Those who are determined to do so will still be able to discriminate. Moreover, this kind of behavior will be harder for platforms to police than it already is. Advertisers with bad intentions will have plausible deniability—after all, they aren’t directly targeting protected categories, they’re just reaching people based on behavior. And the whole system will be more opaque to users and regulators.We wrote about FLoC and the other initial batch of proposals when they were first introduced, calling FLoC “the opposite of privacy-preserving technology.” We hoped that the standards process would shed light on FLoC’s fundamental flaws, causing Google to reconsider pushing it forward. Indeed, several issues on the official Github page raise the exact same concerns that we highlight here. However, Google has continued developing the system, leaving the fundamentals nearly unchanged. It has started pitching FLoC to advertisers, boasting that FLoC is a “95% effective” replacement for cookie-based targeting. And starting with Chrome 89, released on March 2, it’s deploying the technology for a trial run. A small portion of Chrome users—still likely millions of people—will be (or have been) assigned to test the new technology.Make no mistake, if Google does through on its plan to implement FLoC in Chrome, it will likely give everyone involved “options.” The system will probably be opt-in for the advertisers that will benefit from it, and opt-out for the users who stand to be hurt. Google will surely tout this as a step forward for “transparency and user control,” knowing full well that the vast majority of its users will not understand how FLoC works, and that very few will go out of their way to turn it off. It will pat itself on the back for ushering in a new, private era on the Web, free of the evil third-party cookie—the technology that Google helped extend well past its shelf life, making billions of dollars in the process.It doesn’t have to be that way. The most important parts of the privacy sandbox, like dropping third-party identifiers and fighting fingerprinting, will genuinely change the Web for the better. Google can choose to dismantle the old scaffolding for surveillance without replacing it with something new and uniquely harmful.We emphatically reject the future of FLoC. That is not the world we want, nor the one users deserve.

Young and rising Linux security developer Alexander Popov of London-based Positive Technologies discovered and fixed a set of five security holes in the Linux kernel's virtual socket implementation. An attacker could use these vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26708) to gain root access and knock out servers in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

With a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3 base score of 7.0, high severity, smart Linux administrators will patch their systems as soon as possible.  While Popov discovered the bugs in Red Hat's community Linux distribution Fedora 33 Server, it exists in the system using the Linux kernel from November 2019's version 5.5 to the current mainline kernel version 5.11-rc6.  These holes entered Linux when virtual socket multi-transport support was added. This networking transport facilitates communication between virtual machines (VM) and their host.  It's commonly used by guest agents and hypervisor services that need a communications channel that is independent of the VM network configuration. As such, people who are running VMs on the cloud, which is pretty much everyone these days, are especially vulnerable. The core problem is race conditions in the CONFIG_VSOCKETS and CONFIG_VIRTIO_VSOCKETS kernel drivers. These are shipped as kernel modules in all major Linux distributions. The reason why this is such a serious problem is whenever an ordinary user creates an AF_VSOCK socket, the vulnerable modules are automatically loaded.  A race condition exists when a system's substantive behavior depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events.  Popov said, ""I successfully developed a prototype exploit for local privilege escalation on Fedora 33 Server, bypassing x86_64 platform protections such as SMEP and SMAP. This research will lead to new ideas on how to improve Linux kernel security."" In the meantime, Popov also prepared the patch and revealed the vulnerabilities to the Linux kernel security team. Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable Linux kernel chief maintainer, accepted the patches into Linux 5.10.13 on February 3. Since then the patch has been merged into mainline kernel version 5.11-rc7 and backported into affected stable trees. The patch has also already been incorporated into such popular Linux distributions as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, Debian, Ubuntu, and SUSE. This is far from the first time Popov discovered and fixed Linux kernel vulnerabilities. Previously, he's found and repaired CVE-2019-18683 and CVE-2017-2636. Keep up the good work, Popov!  Related Stories:

181,Facebook Strikes Deal to Restore News Sharing in Australia,Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/technology/facebook-australia-news.html,"AdvertisementSupported byThe agreement means users and publishers in Australia can once again share links to news articles, after Facebook had blocked the practice last week.By Mike Isaac and Damien CaveSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook said on Monday that it would restore the sharing and viewing of news links in Australia after gaining more time to negotiate over a proposed law that would require it to pay for news content that appeared on its site.The social network had blocked news links in Australia last week as the new law neared passage. The legislation includes a code of conduct that would allow media companies to bargain individually or collectively with digital platforms over the value of their news content.Facebook had vigorously objected to the code, which would curb its power and drive up its spending for content, as well as set a precedent for other governments to follow. The company had argued that news would not be worth the hassle in Australia if the bill became law.But on Monday, Facebook returned to the negotiating table after the Australian government granted a few minor concessions. Under several amendments to the code, Facebook would get more time to cut deals with publishers so it would not be immediately forced into making payments defined by media companies. The amendments also suggested that if digital platforms voluntarily contributed enough money to the Australian news industry, the companies could avoid the code entirely, at least for now.In exchange, Facebook agreed to restore news links and articles for Australian users “in the coming days,” according to a statement from Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s treasurer, and Paul Fletcher, the minister for communications, infrastructure, cities and the arts.Campbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships, said in a statement that the social network was restoring news in Australia as “the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.”The amendments offer a reprieve for both Facebook and the Australian government, which have been in a standoff over the proposed law for months. Those tensions came to a head last week when Facebook cut off news sharing in the country, causing disruption and confusion for millions of Australians.Links to news articles were blocked, along with the Facebook pages for Australian state agencies, health departments and emergency services. Users became upset when a flood of false or misleading pages filled the information void, spreading bogus theories on the perils of 5G wireless technology and false claims about Covid-19 vaccinations.“In just a few days, we saw the damage that taking news out can cause,” said Sree Sreenivasan, a professor at the Stony Brook School of Communication and Journalism. “Misinformation and disinformation, already a problem on the platform, rushed to fill the vacuum.”The dispute between Australia and Facebook dates to when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the country’s top competition authority, began drafting a bill last year. Australian officials have said the bill’s main goal was to create the conditions for deals between platforms and publishers, which have been at odds for years over the value of journalism and whether either side should be paid by the other.Google and Facebook, which have been accustomed to largely not paying for news content, both balked at the proposed legislation. In August, Facebook said it would block users and news organizations in Australia from sharing local and international news stories on its social network and Instagram if the bill were to move forward. Last month, Google also threatened to make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the government approved the legislation.But in recent weeks, Google began striking deals with media companies such as Reuters, The Financial Times and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.Facebook, by contrast, held firm against the proposed legislation. That was because the code contained terms such as “final arbitration,” which would give an independent arbiter the power to set the price for news content if a publisher and the digital platform could not agree on a payment.Facebook has repeatedly argued that the law gets the value proposition backward because it has said it is the one that provides value to news publishers by sending traffic to media websites, which can then be monetized with advertising.But supporters of the law have said that final arbitration — which is used for contract disputes between players and Major League Baseball in the United States — provides needed leverage when one side is powerful enough to otherwise avoid negotiation if it chooses.“The key is, and remains, the mandatory arbitration clause,” said Johan Lidberg, a media professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “That has to be maintained; without it the code would be toothless.”The proposed law also opens up the potential for a long line of publishers to demand payouts. Any news publisher with more than 150,000 Australian dollars in annual revenue could seek to register as a party to the code, giving it the ability to force a company like Facebook into a negotiation.The law would also grant enormous discretion to the federal treasurer. Mr. Frydenberg would have the power to designate which companies must negotiate under the code’s provisions, while also deciding which media companies were able to register. Facebook and Google have been aiming to avoid that designation.With the new amendments, Australian officials appeared to give Facebook more time to produce the kinds of deals that Google has already delivered, while continuing to hold the hammer of final arbitration over the company’s head. Facebook maintains it can still eliminate news from its platform to potentially avoid a negotiation.In its statement, the government argued that the amendments would strengthen the hand of regional and small publishers in obtaining appropriate remuneration for the use of their content by the digital platforms.But if the government agrees not to make Facebook subject to the code because it completes enough deals with major media companies, smaller publishers may be left out.“For small publishers and freelance journalists that have become reliant on Facebook to distribute their news, it will be a huge relief that the news tap has been turned back on,” said Marcus Strom, president of Australian’s union for journalists. “But they will remain at the mercy of Facebook and Google, which are both seeking to avoid mandatory regulation and will instead choose which media companies they come to agreements with.”Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Damien Cave from Sydney, Australia.Advertisement"
182,Arizona advances bill forcing Apple and Google to allow Fortnite-style alternative payment options,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation,"Filed under:The bill, HB2005, opens the door for alternative payment systems on iOS and AndroidThe Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. The legislation, a sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to ongoing antitrust lawsuits between Apple and Google and companies like Forntite maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. “Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. “The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a report from Protocol published earlier this week, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, Protocol reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told Protocol.In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. “Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” “Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an op-ed for the Arizona Capitol Times last month. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker engaged in a dispute with Basecamp over its new Hey email application. “Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an ongoing antitrust lawsuit against both Apple and Google over the removal of Fortnite last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as a backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue generated from digital goods. The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month failed to pass the state’s senate. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” according to The Bismarck Tribune. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which cut special deals with Apple. But growing resentment from developers large and small, an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a new small business program late last year allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.Update March 2nd, 2:44PM ET: Added additional comment from David Heinemeier Hansson regarding his company’s response to the successful HB2005 vote.

183,Cellphone inventor tells the wild inside story of Motorola's DynaTAC,Software,https://www.cnet.com/news/the-inventor-of-the-cellphone-on-the-wild-inside-story-of-the-motorola-dynatac/,"Martin Cooper, who led the creation of the DynaTAC, shares his thoughts on that first phone and the broadband gap problem.On April 3, 1972, Motorola executive Martin Cooper made the first call from a cellphone using a Motorola Dynatac 8000x.When Apple or Samsung unveils a new smartphone, consumers can preorder the device within days and expect to get it in their hands within weeks. When Motorola introduced the first-ever cellphone, the DynaTAC, in 1973, it took another decade before consumers could actually use one. Talk about delayed gratification. Ironically, it took the team at Motorola just three months to conceive and build the first DynaTAC, a minor miracle considering it takes 12 to 18 months today to do the same thing with a flagship smartphone. The company only made two prototypes, the culmination of thousands of parts welded together in a boot-shaped phone with a massive antenna. ""It's far more complicated than a modern phone, believe it or not,"" Martin Cooper, who led the team at Motorola and is credited as the father of the cellphone, said in an interview for the Daily Charge podcast last week.Cooper shared stories about the whirlwind race to develop that first phone, which was less a commercial product and more an attempt to head off attempts by then-monopoly AT&T to get a stranglehold on the wireless business. The reaction he got from his colleagues: ""That's impossible."" They went to work anyway, culminating in Cooper's memorable first-ever cellphone call to rival AT&T engineer Joel Engel while standing on a sidewalk in Manhattan next to a journalist. ""I didn't hold back at all in rubbing it in,"" Cooper quipped, noting that to this day, Engel says he doesn't remember the call. Cooper reflects back on the impact that cellphones have had on the world, and what the wireless business still needs to do when it comes to issues like closing the broadband gap and the real promise of 5G. He shared his '70s-inspired business insights, like taking a customer-centric approach to products and services and embracing a willingness to fail, that still holds true today.Stay in the know. Get the latest tech stories from CNET News every weekday.Given the dominance of AT&T at that time, Cooper also speculates on what would have happened had Motorola failed and Ma Bell taken control of the wireless business. (Hint: AT&T was really big into car phones at the time.)Those stories are part of his new book, Cutting the Cord, which came out earlier this year.The following are more of this thoughts from the interview.While cellphones, and now modern smartphones, have brought new ways to access information to more people than ever, there are still many left behind. Cooper estimates that 40% of the students in this country don't have access to broadband wireless. ""Just imagines what that means over the long term,"" he said. ""That's unacceptable.""Cooper said the technology exists to deliver wireless broadband to students for as little as $5 to $10 a month, and that the government needs to be more proactive in convincing carriers to offer such services. ""It's as essential as water and food,"" he said. ""We need to have 100% accessibility to broadband services not just for students, but everyone.""You can hear all of Cooper's thoughts here in a four-part discussion that will run over the next several days.

185,Robinhood is facing nearly 50 lawsuits over GameStop frenzy.,Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/business/robinhood-gamestop.html,"AdvertisementBy Matthew GoldsteinRobinhood, the brokerage of choice for legions of online day traders, is in talks with securities regulators and other authorities over a host of matters, including last month’s surge in shares of GameStop and other so-called meme stocks.The firm, in a regulatory filing on Friday, said it has received requests for information from federal prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, various states attorneys general and other financial regulators over its decision to restrict trading last month in stocks including GameStop.The filing also said the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, and the S.E.C. are investigating the firm’s options trading platform and how it displays information about options trading and cash positions to its customers. Robinhood has faced criticism over how its app displays information since the death last year of Alexander Kearns, a 20-year-old who killed himself because he thought he had incurred more than $700,000 in losses. Mr. Kearns’s family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the brokerage.Robinhood, a privately traded company with financial backing from several Silicon Valley firms, also disclosed other investigations, including an inquiry by Finra into a March 2020 outage that stopped some customers from accessing the firm’s trading platform on the web and its mobile app at a time of major market volatility as a result of the coronavirus.Robinhood has become popular over the past several years with retail investors and fast-fingered day traders because of it does not charge commissions on trades, but last year it settled a case with the S.E.C. over its disclosures to customers about how it earned money.The firm said it is facing at least four potential class-action lawsuits over it disclosures about the fees it receives from other firms.That source of revenue — called payment for order flow — drew the attention of angry users after Robinhood curbed trading last month in GameStop and other stocks that got caught up in a retail-trading frenzy that briefly sent the video-game retailers shares soaring.In the regulatory filing, Robinhood disclosed that it is facing at least “46 putative class actions and three individual actions” over the trading restrictions.Advertisement"
186,The Dark Side of Bill Gates’s Climate Techno-Optimism,Politics,https://newrepublic.com/article/161533/bill-gates-climate-vaccines,"“No” is probably not a word the world’s second-richest man is all that accustomed to hearing. Bill Gates, one might imagine, exists in a world of near-limitless possibility. When he throws money at things, they often happen: from an elaborate meal prepared by personal chefs to a revolution in personal computing. Why should the climate crisis be any different?In the press tour for his new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, Gates has presented himself as having put his big engineer brain to work devising the path to solving climate change, shrugging off the fact that the politics haven’t caught up. It’s an audacious title for a book with a relatively limited scope. The core argument is that the world urgently needs to lower what he calls “Green Premiums”: the extra costs associated with no-carbon energy and other technologies as opposed to more polluting alternatives. The zero-carbon options worth deploying, he writes, are those “with no premium at all.” And so everything has to be poured into lowering them, creating “breakthroughs” that make climate goals look more realistic. Gates doesn’t write off the role of government or think entrepreneurs—or billionaires, for that matter—can go it alone. But in the climate fight, the public sector’s role is to make private sector excellence possible. That means both greatly expanding public sector research and enacting more sweeping regulations and legislation—including clean energy standards and carbon prices—to help incentivize the adoption of green technologies. “In general,” Gates writes, “the government’s role is to invest in R&D when the private sector won’t because it can’t see how it will make a profit. Once it becomes clear how a company can make money, the private sector takes over.” Socialize the risk, in other words, and privatize the reward. Gates has taken a similar approach to vaccine development, engineering public-private partnerships that—while making impressive progress vaccinating millions around the world—have also left pharmaceutical companies calling the shots and reaping profits.On Monday, Gates spoke at CERAWeek, an annual confab for the oil and gas industry. The goal in tackling climate change, Gates told author Daniel Yergin, is “to have hundreds and hundreds of great companies that are pursuing the things that will improve these metrics.” He pointed to his work in vaccines as a success story. Gates has poured a fortune into transforming the vaccine industry, where his personal preferences and largesse are now central. But the results of that investment aren’t universally encouraging. When publicly funded researchers developing a Covid-19 vaccine at Oxford University planned to donate royalty-free licenses to manufacturers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation intervened. As Kaiser Health News reports, the Foundation pushed the researchers—whose work it helped fund—into signing over exclusive rights. Oxford struck a deal with AstraZeneca, with no guarantee that the vaccine would be made available at low prices. This was a pattern many other vaccines followed, absent Gates Foundation intervention. Basic research conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, Defense Department, and federally funded academic labs provided the building blocks for the Covid-19 vaccines, and the United States has spent $10.5 billion since the start of the pandemic to ramp up delivery. Moderna alone received some $1 billion from the U.S., having partnered directly with the NIH. Drugmakers have, notably, agreed to provide the vaccine at cost through the duration of the pandemic—but are also strong-arming governments to negotiate lucrative supply deals that insulate them from liability. And given that such deals are typically shrouded in secrecy, there’s also very little way to verify that vaccines are really being provided on a not-for-profit basis. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism found that Uganda paid three times what the EU was paying for the AstraZeneca vaccine. South Africa is paying double. So far, just 10 high-income countries have received 75 percent of existing vaccine supplies. Divides exist in the U.S., too, albeit bound up in state-level distribution problems: As of early last month, just 5 percent of jabs had gone to Black Americans. Globally, the WHO reported around the same time that 130 countries housing some 2.5 billion people had yet to administer a single dose—a situation being referred to as “vaccine apartheid.” Moderna, meanwhile, expects to make billions. Ameet Sarpatwari, an epidemiologist and lawyer at Harvard Medical School who studies drug-pricing regulation, told Kaiser Health News that Covid-19 vaccine deployment has proceeded with “business as usual, where the manufacturers are getting exclusive rights and we are hoping on the basis of public sentiment that they will price their products responsibly.”That the Gates Foundation pushed Oxford to abandon its donation plan fits within its “Global Access” approach to intellectual property. As Gates himself explained in 2011:We fund research and we actually ourselves or our partners create intellectual property so that anything that is invented with our foundation money that goes to richer countries, we’re actually getting a return on that money. By doing that we have more money to devote for research into neglected diseases and the diseases of the poor. Now when our medicines go into the poor countries, they are always going in without any intellectual property fee, at very lowest cost pricing.Private, proprietary control over life-saving intellectual property is key for the Foundation, even in pledging that vaccines will be accessible. That means striking a bargain with the companies it partners with on vaccine development and manufacturing. As Richard Wilder, associate legal counsel for the Foundation’s Global Health Program, said in 2013, firms and universities it works with agree that “the product will be accessible. But if there is a commercial advantage to be obtained by launching a technology in other markets or for other populations, they don’t want to give that up and we don’t want them to give it up because profitability in those other markets can make their work sustainable.” The Foundation’s model, in other words, rests on agreeing to get companies to offer lower prices in exchange for its funding. That’s allowed the development and distribution of life-saving vaccines. But at the end of the day the patent holders, not public interest, call the shots.The potential damage from this intellectual property–forward approach to Covid vaccines was clear from the start. Way back in July 2020, months before the first vaccines had been approved, South African and Indian representatives to the World Trade Organization called on the organization to temporarily suspend intellectual property enforcement for Covid-19 vaccines and related products. The U.S., U.K., European Union, and several other vaccine-rich wealthy nations have continually blocked the proposal, which now has the support of 140 countries. Biden early on in his administration announced that the U.S. would join COVAX, a global private-public partnership to ensure equitable vaccine access. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Anthony Fauci has further suggested the U.S. could work with pharmaceutical companies to relax patents and improve global manufacturing. On Tuesday, the White House announced its use of the Defense Production Act to get Merck and Johnson & Johnson to work together on accelerating vaccinations domestically. Still, just 27 percent of the most vulnerable developing countries are due to benefit from COVAX vaccines by the end of this year. And the unofficial summary of a WTO meeting last month seemed to confirm the White House will stay the course on intellectual property protections: “The U.S. reiterated that the intellectual property framework provides critical legal and commercial incentives to drive private entities to undertake the risk and make the appropriate investments.” Asked why it hadn’t supported the proposal from South Africa and India, the Gates Foundation told South Africa’s Mail & Guardian that “changing the rules wouldn’t make any additional vaccines available.” Vaccine apartheid can hardly be blamed on Gates alone, obviously. But the vaccines’ disastrously unequal rollout does offer a preview for what enacting his vision of climate action could mean for a warming world. Gates’s book doesn’t mention intellectual property rights, even though his entire model of incentivizing innovation depends on them. It’s an odd omission. Gates’s own fortune on Windows and Microsoft was amassed in no small part, economist Dean Baker has pointed out, through strategic patenting, including of research whose earliest stages had been sponsored by the government. The company has argued forcefully for the WTO to strengthen rules protecting intellectual property. And since leaving day-to-day operations, he’s been a prolific patent filer, including, in 2009, for technology to tame hurricanes. Gates’s multibillion-dollar fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures is funding green start-ups and a host of other low-carbon entrepreneurial projects, including everything from advanced nuclear technologies to synthetic breast milk. Its returns depend on those projects having patents to hold. But the fact that Gates could see modest (for him) profits if policymakers take his advice is less concerning than the advice itself. Gates is offering policymakers a shiny-object approach to climate politics. It’s hard to argue against innovation: New technologies, including the majority of those Gates highlights, are indeed a critical part of the solution to climate change. Most models can’t figure out how to keep warming below 1.5 and two degrees Celsius (2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) without much cheaper and more efficient means of sucking carbon out of the atmosphere, for instance. But the heavier lifting of decarbonization has to be done as soon as humanly possible: remaking the grid, deploying massive amounts of clean energy, and decreasing fossil fuel production. The idea that climate action relies on a set of technologies that are always just around the bend deflects attention away from the lions’ share of the work, which can be done right away. As Gates reiterated in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, “The only value is to take our innovation power, which is the majority of the world, and bring green premiums down by 95 percent. That’s what the U.S. has to do. All the other stuff is just so much confusion.” Carbon capturing and storage will play an important role fighting global warming, to be sure. But Gates’s move to place such things at the center of the decarbonization story helps explain why the American Petroleum Institute tweeted so approvingly about Gates’s message to CERAweek about the central importance of new technologies like green hydrogen. API chief Mike Sommers echoed the line that now dominates his industry, by now far too savvy to deny climate change outright: With no viable alternatives on offer, the world will continue to demand oil and gas. So, he says, “We have to invest in technologies to ensure that we’re producing them in the most environmentally responsible ways.”Gates’s vision of how innovation works is equally troubling. His self-presentation as do-gooder engineer—quietly tinkering away at the world’s most pressing challenges—helps obscure a more unsettling worldview: that billionaires and a set of benevolent patent holders are those best equipped to make life-and-death decisions about who gets access to life-saving technologies from vaccines to green energy, and determine how much they should cost. How to Avoid a Climate Disaster sidesteps messy questions of distribution and democracy, instead casting the protagonists of the climate fight as genius entrepreneurs and the forward-thinking investors who fund them. Government has a big role to play, Gates says. But only insofar as it makes the plans developed by expert entrepreneurs possible. (More equitable taxation—which might compel Gates to give up a bit more of his hoarded wealth, rather than funding and controlling charitable projects of his choosing—doesn’t make the cut of his suggested policies.)More edifying than Gates’s work on the innovation front is that of economist Mariana Mazzucato, an expert on innovation pathways and critic of patent hoarding. Rather than treating the state as a dowdy handmaiden to corporations, she argues, governments should see a return on the sorts of pioneering research they routinely fund already. That means governments deciding democratically where it is they want to go. A satisfying answer to that question, Mazzucato says—one capable of taking on a problem as big as the climate crisis—also demands a reevaluation of who it is that generates value. The geniuses writing code are important, though so are workers spanning supply chains and the dedicated public servants who rarely get the credit or compensation they deserve. “The retreat of the public sector has given way to the idea that entrepreneurship and wealth creation are the exclusive preserve of business,” Mazzucato wrote recently. “In fact, the more we subscribe to the myth of private-sector superiority, the worse off we will be in the face of future crises.” In the world of climate discourse, Gates is what’s known as a techno-optimist. But his theory of change is one of benevolent intellectual property domination. Vaccine apartheid has been a preview for climate apartheid, and the perils of letting intellectual property rights determine who gets access to critical technologies. If Gates is able to perceive the huge costs of this model, he hasn’t let on.Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic."

188,"Inside ‘TALON,’ the Nationwide Network of AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras",Privacy,https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvx4bq/talon-flock-safety-cameras-police-license-plate-reader,"""Give your neighborhood peace of mind,"" an advertisement for Flock, a line of smart surveillance cameras, reads. A February promotional video claims that the company's ""mission is to eliminate nonviolent crime across the country. We can only do that by working with every neighborhood and every police department throughout the country.""Quietly, this seems to be happening. Flock, whose cameras use automatic license plate reader technology, is well on its way to deploying a connected network of AI-powered cameras that detect the movements of cars across the United States.The cameras, which are sold to law enforcement, homeowners associations, and businesses, can automatically record when a ""non-resident"" vehicle drives into a community, and alert police to cars on a hotlist. Communities have created ""virtual gates"" around their neighborhoods, with cameras capturing each vehicle driving in and out of the area. Through a program called TALON, this little-known company is allowing police officers to track cars—and by extension, specific people—outside of their own jurisdictions.Hundreds of pages of internal police emails from nearly 20 police departments around the country obtained using public records requests by Motherboard show how Flock has slowly expanded its network, helped law enforcement agencies gain access to it, and has rolled out TALON with very little fanfare. TALON gives police access to a nationwide network of cameras that have been installed by law enforcement agencies around the country.The TALON network offers up to 500 million scans of vehicles a month, according to one email obtained by Motherboard. Over 500 police departments in more than 1,000 cities have access to Flock cameras, according to marketing material. In the promotional video, the company claims to be able to detect people, cars, animals, and bicycles, and says it is ""collecting evidence"" that helps police solve 4 to 5 crimes per hour. The administrator of the neighborhood's camera network can make the data Flock captures available to, say, the police, the home owner association's board, or the individual members of an entire neighborhood.Previous coverage has focused on how residents in individual neighborhoods have banded together to purchase Flock cameras for their own use. In 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported how members of a community in Sherman Oaks purchased the cameras to keep tabs on which cars are driving in and out of their own area.Emails obtained by Motherboard show police-purchased Flock cameras may be installed outside a Burger King, a Lowes, or other businesses, and that controversial Fusion Centers, which hoover in data from various federal, state, and local sources to monitor large areas of the country at once, have also discussed gaining access to the footage.The emails also show how Flock works closely with police to try and generate positive media coverage, improve their PR strategy, and ultimately ""get your jurisdiction activated"" and ""bring more private cameras into the area."" In some cases Flock has helped write press releases for agencies, the emails show.""I think of it as the Ring doorbell of LPR,"" Sergeant JT Maultsby from the Raleigh Police Department wrote in one July 2019 email to colleagues.Flock marketing material included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardGarrett Langley founded Flock in 2017 after being the victim of property crime in Atlanta, according to the company's website.""I'm not someone with 25 years of public safety or law enforcement experience. I'm just a civilian that happens to be an electrical engineer, and when I think about the larger mission of Flock, it is to eliminate crime,"" Langley told Motherboard in a phone call.Traditionally, license plate reader cameras have been the expensive property of law enforcement, but Flock's much cheaper and sometimes solar-powered, $2,500 (annually) hardware has tapped a whole new market of private residents who also want to track vehicles in their neighborhoods with the goal of preventing and helping investigate crime.""If our average private customer has two cameras, it's probably because they're a one-way-in, one-way-out cul de sac,"" Langley said. ""This technology has existed for a long time, it's just never been widely available. And now, whether you're a community of 20 homes, or a community of 2,000 homes, you can now afford, what I would argue, is the best in class for crime prevention.""But beyond the cute and suburb-friendly marketing, Flock has privacy experts increasingly concerned about a pervasive, expanding network of AI-powered cameras that can be leveraged by both private residents and law enforcement.""ALPR is a mass surveillance technology. It does not discriminate between people who are involved in crimes and people who are innocent. It just collects data on everyone, with the assumption that maybe one day you might commit a crime,"" Dave Maass, director of investigations at activist group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), told Motherboard in a phone call.Do you have any more information about Flock? Do you use it, or do you know about a case of abuse? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.Such a system, like others before it, brings up questions: Is it biased in how and where the hardware is placed? Is the technology disproportionately used against cars belonging to Black people and people of color? Is the data eventually abused?""My concern, much as with with Ring is that these technologies enable a massively expanded surveillance network that in most cases has little to no oversight or accountability,"" Chris Gilliard, a research fellow with the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, told Motherboard in an online chat. ""On top of that, I worry that it creates another vector for neighborhoods, and by extension law enforcement, to surveil Black folks who are just going about their business. We saw this recently when LAPD requested Ring footage of Black Lives Matter protestors.""""As the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained, police access to people’s electronically collected location history raises serious privacy concerns. License plate readers can create a precise record of where we go and when, and over time can reveal a wealth of sensitive information about our lives,"" Nate Wessler, deputy project director of the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Motherboard in an email.""It is no comfort when these devices are being deployed in supposedly piecemeal fashion by scattered private users,"" he added. ""By providing police with an internet platform to easily stitch together information from dozens or hundreds of license plate readers—without getting a search warrant from a judge—companies like Flock threaten to enable pervasive tracking of our activities and movements.""Flock's cameras come in two models: the Sparrow for collecting footage that can be reviewed later and potentially used as evidence, and the Falcon, which can also send automatic alerts to police if the camera detects a vehicle on a hotlist. The cameras can work at night, and label vehicles that don't belong to the local community as ""non-resident."" Video surveillance trade publication IPVM found in its tests that the Flock hardware generally worked well, but had some issues misidentifying some vehicles as buses or misreading the state on a license plate. A publicly available document published by the County of San Diego says that Flock cameras work across distances of 8-120ft. Maass pointed Motherboard to the document.Flock marketing material included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardThe company also offers a product that turns existing internet connected cameras into Flock-enabled cameras, and the hardware can be connected to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which automatically alerts law enforcement when the camera detects someone in that database. The NCIC includes information on stolen vehicles, immigration violators, missing persons, sex offenders, gang members, and more. Flock pushes an average of 120 hotlist notifications every hour, according to its marketing material.With these lists, police have wide latitude to use Flock for whatever is legally permissible in their own jurisdiction. The County of San Diego document also says that police departments can upload their own custom hotlists in a spreadsheet.When asked if Flock could include scanning for immigration-related license plates, Flock's Langley told Motherboard ""Yes, if it was legal in a state, we would not be in a position to stop them. I don't think we would be in a position to encourage it either.""""We give our customers the tools to decide and let them go from there,"" he added.Police can also use a ""Google-like"" search feature to filter footage for certain types and colors of cars, as well as whether they have a roof rack or spoiler. The cameras also record vehicles that do not have a license plate at all, and can perform ""convoy analysis"" to identify suspicious groups of vehicles, marketing material shows. This year, the company plans to introduce a reverse image search feature and an app police officers can use to take a photo of a car and then look up the previous movements of that vehicle, it adds.Beyond automatic alerts, communities can, similar to Ring, elect to provide their footage to a law enforcement agency who may then use it to investigate a potential crime.""Our customers tend to buy this product to better serve their local law enforcement agency,"" Langley added.The potential use cases are not just for law enforcement, however. When asked whether Flock data has ever been requested as part of a civil divorce case, Langley said, ""In my knowledge, which is obviously not perfect, there's been one example of what you're describing, but by the time all of the legal proceedings and everything went through, it was past 30 days, and the footage was gone."" (Camera footage is stored on Flock's systems for 30 days, the emails say. But police can download the data and keep hold of it if it is used as evidence in a criminal case, Flock told Motherboard in an email.)At least some police officers are facing an overload of footage and material as citizens continue to move into self-surveillance tools, like Ring and Flock.""Another issue I see in the future is adjusting expectations of the residents we serve as we are seeing a trend where we are overloaded with video evidence and multiple databases (RING, Nextdoor, individual cell phones and businesses, etc.),"" Sgt. Bruce Clark of the San Antonio Police Department wrote to colleagues in an August 2019 email.Flock marketing material included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardOnce a community installs a set of cameras, Flock may then reach out to police departments to let them know about the possibility of accessing the footage.""Would love to talk to you about access to free cameras already installed in Tucson (MOU) [memorandum of understanding] as well as access to State/national cameras (all free…),"" a Flock territory sales manager wrote to the Tucson Police Department in an October 2020 email. Police can also use a ""Camera Map"" feature to see where cameras are located and then request access themselves, another email adds. Flock told Motherboard this map includes cameras from neighborhoods or small businesses within a certain radius.Fusion Centers have also expressed interest in accessing Flock data.""FLOCK already has their license plate reader systems in several neighborhoods in North SA [San Antonio] now,"" James Glass, the deputy director of the Southwest Texas Fusion Center, wrote in an October 2020 email to colleagues. ""In order to be granted free access to search the FLOCK system for license plate reader hits, we are asked to agree to sign this MOU."" Glass did not respond to a request for comment.Ray Schultz, the chief of the Memorial Villages Police Department in Texas, told Motherboard the department recovered 61 stolen vehicles last year, with a $1.8 million value of vehicles recovered since it started using the ALPR system.""A couple more great successes this weekend,"" Schultz wrote in a June 2020 email to Flock employees. ""2 recoveries, including one with stolen ID, a Stimulus Check and Fake ID's. A few pics are below."" Schultz clarified to Motherboard that the Stimulus Check was stolen, too. Flock encourages police officers to share these sorts of success stories with the company.Similar to how Ring works hand-in-hand with police departments to help craft press releases and promote sales of its cameras, Flock's relationship extends beyond just selling cameras or providing law enforcement access to any generated footage.Details on a Flock deployment available on a publicly accessible URL included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardIn one email, a Flock staffer offered members of the New Lenox Police Department their abilities for ""drafting social media posts, pitching local reporters, writing press releases."" The purpose, ultimately, is to ""generate some goodwill and get your jurisdiction activated, bring more private cameras into the area, and highlight your successes!"" the email from the Flock staffer continues. ""Please use us as your resource!""The result is a circle, with Flock working with police to generate positive coverage, to encourage more communities to purchase cameras, and to then provide access to that footage to the police, and around again.""We have seen these stories be very successful in helping grow the awareness of the ALPRs, helping gain traction with HOAs [home owners associations], banks, and other businesses that could potentially buy more cameras for the Village,"" another Flock staffer wrote to the New Lenox Police Department. The email added that Flock has helped craft press releases for other Illinois agencies.""I think they want to give it to us so they can say they are working with SAPD. Same method as Ring Doorbell,"" Aric C. Jimenez from the San Antonio Police Department wrote to colleagues in a July 2019 email.Josh Thomas, VP of marketing for Flock, acknowledged in a phone call this sort of PR relationship between a private company and law enforcement agencies was ""probably not standard.""""Historically law enforcement agencies just aren't that great at explaining to the public how they're using their technology,"" he said. ""We need to let the public know what is happening, and we should work with them to make that possible.""Flock marketing material included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardFlock's business with law enforcement appears to be booming.""What we're seeing is, very specifically, a market war going on between two particular companies,"" Maass from the EFF told Motherboard. One of those is Motorola Solutions, which owns Vigilant Solutions, an established ALPR vendor which sells cameras to law enforcement. The other is law enforcement contracting giant Axon, which has partnered with Flock, including integrating Flock with Axon's own in-car cameras.""Axon Fleet 3 mobile ALPR will be integrated into the Flock Safety System allowing law enforcement to use Flock’s Vehicle Fingerprint Technology across both mobile and fixed ALPR reads. This will create an unmatched city-wide ALPR network designed to not only capture license plate numbers, but to capture objective vehicle evidence to help law enforcement solve more crime,"" Flock marketing material reads.Historically, Vigilant had likely the largest market share of law enforcement-owned ALPR cameras around the country. But because Flock is so much cheaper it has been able to flip a growing number of police departments to its products, Maass said. Flock told Motherboard it has acquired some law enforcement customers who previously worked with other vendors, but also attributed that to what they said was a better product and their commitment to ""ethical development.""""From what I understand there are people in the law enforcement community who have been turned off by Vigilant Solutions,"" Maass said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has bought access to Vigilant's nationwide dataset; Customs and Border Protection likely did the same. Vigilant also offers facial recognition technology. Vigilant is still a formidable presence in the market, however, working with more than 1,600 agencies according to the public County of San Diego document.""Flock, because it is affiliated with Axon now, is posturing itself as the more ethical solution than Vigilant,"" Maass said. (Axon also makes tasers and body cameras, and has faced criticism from civil rights groups.)In the recent marketing video, a Flock employee says ""privacy is very important to Flock, and we have done a lot to protect privacy of our customers."" The employee appears to be talking about the privacy of the people who own or administrate cameras, not the privacy of the general public, who may drive past a network of Flock cameras. Residents of communities that have bought the cameras can ask to opt-out of having their vehicle movements recorded, Flock's website reads. For other people who may drive past cameras, there is no meaningful mechanism of consent as they may not be aware such cameras are recording their movements or which neighborhoods to contact one by one in an effort to opt-out.Some of the emails obtained by Motherboard include invitations from Flock to police departments to join online ""roundtables"" with Flock's Langley and Axon CEO Rick Smith.""Rick will discuss ethics-first design of ALPRs and how that aligns with police reform efforts and where the technology is going. Joining him will be Flock Safety CEO and Founder, Garret Langley. The Axon AI Ethics Board is an independent body that is rapidly gaining influence among both law enforcement and community/justice reform communities,"" one of the emails reads. Another shows an AXON employee talking to members of the San Antonio Police Department offering to answer questions about Flock.Maass also pointed to Flock's 30-day retention period, but doesn't think that will necessarily result in fewer plates being scanned. Because of Flock's cheaper price, ""police can install more of them,"" Maass said. ""Combined with all of the home owners associations, there actually may be even worse problems.""Police have been purchasing and installing Flock's cameras around their neighborhoods, according to the emails.""Myself and Sgt. Nuesse have been working with Walmart, Lowes, and Burger King to secure permission to either sink a pole or attach to their existing for 03, 04 and 17,"" Hilary Davis, the deputy chief of the New Lenox Police Department, wrote in an August 2020 email to Flock, referring to a specific series of camera installations.Some of the emails included links to web pages used by Flock's customers and engineers to lay out where the cameras are to be set up. As well as the New Lenox cameras, another showed camera locations in Atherton, California.Details on a Flock deployment available on a publicly accessible URL included in emails obtained by Motherboard. Image: MotherboardThe City Council approved the purchase of 16 cameras in May 2020, according to a local media report.""In addition to the 16 ALPR cameras located along the Atherton borders, Staff believes that the presence of additional ALPR cameras in an [sic] around the backstreets will further increase the chances of identifying a vehicle used in the commission of a crime. Thus, staff seeks to form a Public/Private partnership opportunity with any resident interested in purchasing a Flock ALPR camera,"" a City Council report reads. ""In short, a private resident would fund single or multiple Flock ALPR cameras and the Atherton Police Department would assume the administrative responsibilities associated with the camera’s operation. Staff has already been approached by residents in the Lindenwood and Lloyden Park neighborhoods who expressed interest in this proposed collaborative crime solving effort.""Drawing even clearer comparisons to Vigilant, Flock now offers law enforcement clients access to the nationwide network of police-purchased cameras, called the Total Analytics Law Officers Network, or TALON.""TALON—a local and national plate search with up to 500M monthly plate reads,"" one October 2020 email from a Flock employee to the New Lenox Police Department reads. Flock publicly announced the TALON product in August 2020. Each agency which owns Flock cameras opts-in to sharing their footage, the blog post adds.Although operating in a more concentrated area than Flock cameras spread across the United States, in Johannesburg, South Africa, a company called Vumacam has installed smart cameras across a mostly white, middle-class suburb to increase the security of their neighborhood, in what can be described as an ""AI-powered apartheid.""With Flock, ""When you have these systems paid for by wealthier businesses, or wealthier neighborhoods, that may result in a disproportionate level of service between communities,"" Maass said. On one side, you may have a richer, whiter neighborhood, and on the other, a poorer Black community, but both with car thefts.""If one neighborhood has a bunch of surveillance cameras designed to stop those car thefts, then perhaps they're going to have police come out and solve those crimes more than in other communities,"" Maass added.Police departments may collect data on more communities than others, either with intent as part of a deliberate program, or passively by, say, responding to more crimes with an ALPR camera in their vehicle and then collecting more data with that, Maass said.Police, for their part, will likely continue to both buy and obtain footage from, Flock cameras.""We actually continue to encourage residents to obtain and use video doorbells and outside video systems. We have found that the various tools help investigators,"" Schultz, the chief of the Memorial Villages Police Department in Texas, said."

Excel 4.0 (XLM) is an old macro language which Microsoft released for Excel back in 1992. Although it is a legacy language and most organizations have since migrated to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), some continue to use XLM because of its functionalities and interoperability with the OS. Microsoft has noticed that due to its continued use, malicious actors have started to abuse XLM macros more frequently, which is why the company is now enabling runtime inspection of XLM code in Microsoft Excel.Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) was already integrated with VBA back in 2018 and has been very successful in exposing and stopping malware attacks dependent upon the particular technology. Naturally, malicious actors have recently shifted focus to relatively less secure technologies such as XLM to call Win32 APIs and run shell commands for their activities. As such, Microsoft is now enabling runtime inspection of XLM code in Office 365 applications such as Excel.Multiple tools and antivirus solutions can utilize AMSI to request scans of data to detect potential threats. The Redmond tech giant uses it heavily with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for threat detection in various applications such as Office VBA macros, JScript, VBScript, PowerShell, WMI, dynamically loaded .NET assemblies, and MSHTA/Jscript9.Microsoft has noted that this new integration with XLM is essential, saying that:Like VBA and many other scripting languages abused by malware, XLM code can be obfuscated relatively easily to conceal the real intent of the macro. For example, attackers can hide URLs or file names of executable files from static inspection through simple strings manipulations. Attackers also take advantage of the way macro code persists within the Excel document—while VBA macros are stored in a dedicated OLE stream (and hence can be easily located and extracted), XLM macros do not exist as a separate, well-defined entity. Rather, each XLM macro statement is a formula within a cell. Extracting a whole XLM macro can become a cumbersome task, requiring a cell-by-cell inspection of the whole document.In addition, while formulas are typically executed downwards starting from the top, with XLM the macro content can be quite spread out, thanks to control flow statements like RUN, CALL, or GOTO, which allow the switching of execution flow from one column to another. This feature, together with obfuscation, has been abused by attackers to craft documents that could evade static analysis.Multiple malicious groups have been named which are using XLM macros as an attack surface for their activities including Trickbot, Zloader, and Ursnif.Runtime inspection of XLM in Microsoft is now available in AMSI, which means that it can be performed by any antivirus solution that is registered as an AMSI provider for a machine. Under default configurations, files that are from trusted locations or are trusted documents will not be scanned at runtime. The same also applies for files that are opened when the security settings are configured to enable all macros. The feature is enabled by default on the February Current Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel for Microsoft 365 subscription users.

190,Artificial intelligence research continues to grow as China overtakes US in AI journal citations,Artificial Intelligence,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310840/ai-research-global-growth-china-us-paper-citations-index-report-2020,"Filed under:Latest figures show a 34.5 percent increase in publication from 2019 to 2020The artificial intelligence boom isn’t slowing yet, with new figures showing a 34.5 percent increase in the publication of AI research from 2019 to 2020. That’s a higher percentage growth than 2018 to 2019 when the volume of publications increased by 19.6 percent. China continues to be a growing force in AI R&D, overtaking the US for overall journal citations in artificial intelligence research last year. The country already publishes more AI papers than any other country, but the United States still has more cited papers at AI conferences — one indicator of the novelty and significance of the underlying research. These figures come from the fourth annual AI Index, a collection of statistics, benchmarks, and milestones meant to gauge global progress in artificial intelligence. The report is collated with the help of Stanford University, and you can read all 222 pages here.In many ways, the report confirms trends identified in past years: the sheer volume of AI research is growing across a number of metrics, China continues to be increasingly influential, and investors are pumping yet more money into AI firms.However, details reveal subtleties about the AI scene. For example, while private investment in AI increased 9.3 percent in 2020 (a higher increase than 2018 to 2019 of 5.7 percent), the number of newly funded companies receiving funds decreased for the third year in a row. There are several ways to interpret this, but it suggests that investors expect that the winner-takes-all dynamic that has defined the tech industry — in which digital economies of scale tend to reward a few dominant players — will be replicated in the AI world. The report’s section on technical advances also confirms the major trends in AI capabilities, the biggest of which is the industrialization of computer vision. This field has seen incredible progress during the AI boom, with services like object and facial recognition now commonplace. Similarly, generative technologies, which can create video, images, and audio, continue to increase in quality and availability. As the report notes, this trend “promises to generate a tremendous range of downstream applications of AI for both socially useful and less useful purposes.” Useful applications include cheaper computer-generated media, while malicious outcomes include misinformation and AI revenge porn. One area of AI research that seems like it’s just beginning to come into its own is biotech. The drug discovery and design sector received the most private investment of any sector in 2020 ($13.8 billion, 4.5 times more than in 2019), and experts canvassed for AI Index’s report cited DeepMind’s AlphaFold program, which uses machine learning to fold proteins, as one of the most significant breakthroughs in AI in 2020. (The other frequently cited breakthrough last year was OpenAI’s text-generation program GPT-3.)One area where the Index AI report struggles to gauge progress, though, is in ethics. This is a wide-ranging area, spanning everything from the politics of facial recognition to algorithmic bias, and discussion of these topics is increasingly prominent. In 2020, stories like Google’s firing of researcher Timnit Gebru and IBM’s exit from the facial recognition business drove discussions of how AI technology should be applied. But while companies are happy paying lip service to ethical principles, the report notes that most of these “commitments” are non-binding and lack institutional frameworks. As has been noted in the past: AI ethics for many companies is simply a way to slow roll criticism.A newsletter about computers"

The flaw allows an adversary, sharing the same Wi-Fi network, to gain full access to the Windows PC via a communications port opened by the software.WiFi Mouse, published by Necta, is available on Google Play and via Apple’s App Store marketplace under the publisher name Shimeng Wang. The only version tested by Le Roux was the Windows 1.7.8.5 version of WiFi Mouse software running on Windows (Enterprise Build 17763) system.Despite multiple attempts to contact the app developer Necta, the company has not responded to either the researcher’s inquiries or Threatpost’s request for comment. Unclear is whether other versions of the WiFi Mouse desktop software, compatible with Mac, Debian and RPM, are also impacted.According to Le Roux’s research, the unpatched bug does not impact the Android mobile phone’s running the WiFi Mouse application. According to the developer’s Google Play marketplace description of WiFi Mouse, the application has been downloaded over 100,000 times.The vulnerability, according to the developer, is tied to poor password and PIN security required by the Windows desktop application.“The password/PIN option in the Windows Desktop app does not prevent remote control of a target running the software,” Le Roux told Threatpost. “I believe this may be an oversight on the part of the developer.”The researcher said the application doesn’t properly prompt mobile app users to enter a password or a PIN number in order to pair an Android mobile device running WiFi Mouse with the accompanying WiFi Mouse desktop server software. That lack of authentication opens the door to a potential rogue user to exploit the open data port used by WiFi Mouse, Le Roux said.“The WiFi Mouse mobile app scans for and connects to hosts with TCP port 1978 open. Upon connecting the desktop server responds with OS information and the handshake is complete,” he wrote. “From within the mobile app you have a mouse touchpad option as well as a file explorer. The file explorer allows a user to ‘open’ any file on the System. This includes executable files such as cmd.exe or powershell.exe, which will open each command terminal respectively.”Le Roux noted that this type of “unfettered access to a targeted system makes it as easy as sending ASCII characters as HEX with some padding on either side followed by a packet for the enter key.”“This process is quick and easy to program especially because there is no encryption between the server and app,” he wrote in an email-based interview with Threatpost.An adversary needs only the WiFi Mouse server software running on a targeted PC to exploit it – no mobile app needed. “Adversaries gain full remote command execution,” he said.“Sadly the app can be easily mimicked even if it is not installed or on the network. The WiFi Mouse desktop server will accept any connection so long as it is running on an endpoint and the firewall isn’t blocking it’s listening port 1978,” Le Roux told Threatpost.From there, an adversary can run a simple command on the targeted Windows system to download any executable program from an HTTP server and run it to get a remote shell on a target’s PC.“This could be turned into an encoded power shell command or invoke-expression call to drop malware or load a fileless processes,” he said. “Your limitations are those of the signed in user’s permissions and power shell.”While the researcher said his tests were limited to PCs running Windows, he suspects – but cannot confirm – this issue may also impact other platforms.“I have yet to do any testing on macOS. My testing on Debian Linux (Kali) shows that the file explorer option does not function appropriately. This does not eliminate the potential for ‘replaying’ mouse movement data and sending left click and enter key commands to substitute for lack of file explorer however,” he wrote.“An attacker could still feasibly exploit a Unix based system with minimal effort,” he wrote.Share this article:The lack of cybersecurity requirements in weapons contracts from the Department of Defense opens the door for dangerous cyberattacks.

194,Japanese billionaire to fly eight members of the public on SpaceX moon flight,Space,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/yusaku-maezawa-opens-up-public-seats-on-spacex-starship-moon-flight.html,"Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced on Tuesday that he will choose eight members of the public to join him on a trip around the moon, scheduled to fly on SpaceX's Starship rocket in 2023.""I'm inviting you to join me on this mission,"" Maezawa said in a video.Maezawa, who announced the mission in September 2018 alongside SpaceX founder Elon Musk, said that the plan has evolved from flying artists on a trip to lunar orbit.His project, called dearMoon, will now fly ""10 to 12 people in all,"" with eight of the crew coming from members of the public who Maezawa plans to pick.The billionaire says he ""will pay for the entire journey,"" so those who join him will fly for free. Maezawa made his fortune after founding this fashion retail company Zozotown, which he resigned from in 2019 after selling a majority stake to SoftBank.The dearMoon mission will take three days to fly to the moon, loop behind it in orbit, and then spend three days returning. Musk added that, in addition to the historic first as a private lunar mission, the rocket's flight path means it will go beyond the distance traveled by the Apollo missions.""This mission we expect people will go further than any human has ever gone from planet Earth,"" Musk said.The dearMoon website says ""pre-registration"" is open until March 14. The pre-registration application requests a name, country, email address, and a profile picture. An ""initial screening"" process begins March 21, with a ""final interview and medical checkup"" in late May.There are two ""key criteria"" for any person who applies to fly with Maezawa: First, that a prospective passenger can advance ""whatever activity"" they are into ""by going to space.""""By going to space could you do something that's even better, even bigger?"" Maezawa asked.Second, the eight aspiring astronauts must ""be willing and able to support other crew members who share similar aspirations,"" he said.It's been nearly two and a half years since Maezawa made his original dearMoon announcement and the project has stuck to its 2023 goal for the mission's launch.In the meantime, SpaceX has continued to work on developing Starship. The rocket represents a next-generation vehicle that is key to Musk's dreams of space exploration.Musk aims for Starship to be fully reusable – not just the booster, which is the bottom portion of the rocket – by landing and relaunching in a way more similar to a commercial airliner.SpaceX has yet to reach orbit with a Starship rocket, but it is rapidly building and testing prototypes at its facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The company has successfully launched multiple Starship prototypes, landing them safely after short flights to about 500 feet in altitude. Its two most recent high-altitude flights, despite passing multiple development milestones, exploded on impact during attempted landings. SpaceX has not disclosed how much it has spent on the Starship program to date, but Musk previously estimated that he expects it will cost the company about $5 billion to complete.Notably, SpaceX's valuation has soared since Maezawa's original announcement, from about $25 billion at the time to about $74 billion this past month.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.Got a confidential news tip?

195,How the Government Spies on Welfare Claimants | The UK government uses invasive data gathering techniques to try and prove that people claiming benefits are actually living lavish lifestyles.,,https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g9n5/how-the-government-spies-on-welfare-claimants,"Social media monitoring, covert physical surveillance, and data gathering from airlines, PayPal accounts, and bingo clubs, are among the tactics that the UK government has been using to monitor welfare claimants.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which is responsible for the UK’s social security system and benefits support for some of the country’s most vulnerable, deploys excessive surveillance methods, according to a new report by Privacy International. Cracking down on benefit fraud has been a target of successive UK governments, despite it making up a tiny proportion of benefits administered.VICE World News spoke to Rachel Fletcher, a solicitor at the Manchester firm Slater Heelis who represents Ellen, a benefit claimant who has been subject to DWP surveillance. Ellen, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity, lives with a chronic illness. The surveillance was carried out after the DWP began to suspect she wasn’t entitled to disability support.Undercover DWP investigators trailed Ellen and filmed her at a fundraising event – one which she was attending to raise money for a charity for her illness. “She couldn’t actually take part in the event because of her illness and she left in tears,” says Fletcher. “But the DWP doesn't show that, they just show her arriving.”According to a 995-page, heavily reacted DWP employee handbook analysed by Privacy International, surveillance of benefit claimants is permitted as long as it remains “covert, but not intrusive”. But heavy-handed tactics suggest that the social security system has become the site of potentially illegal surveillance against those receiving welfare and disability payments.Ellen had been receiving Personal Independence Payments (PIP), a benefit that’s awarded to help cover everyday costs like transport and assisted living for those with disabilities and long-term illnesses. In 2018, a few months after being awarded the benefit, she started a new health treatment that gave her intermittent relief – some days she could move around easily, and other days she wasn’t able to get out of bed. Still, she contacted the DWP to let them know that her condition had changed, and was told that she didn’t have to worry about any changes in her PIP until her benefit reassessment date, which was scheduled to take place in several years’ time. A few months later, the Department called her in for an “Interview Under Caution” and accused her of faking her disability.At the interview, the DWP presented data obtained from an airline and a social club that she attended. Fletcher, who attended the interview alongside Ellen, says that the evidence was meant to portray her as an affluent spender that had no need for disability assistance. “They start playing all the evidence they'd been gathering over a period of about six weeks [...] Evidence of her going about her daily life, unloading her car, leaving coffee shops and exercising.” All of it was meant to show that she was defrauding the benefit system.“They looked at things like her flights and [said] that she'd upgraded her flights. But they didn't appreciate that the reason she upgraded was that she needed more legroom because of her illness,” says Fletcher. Ellen had been advised by her GP to stay active, but the DWP fraud investigators filmed her exercising and presented it to her at the interview as proof that she should have her benefit withdrawn and face criminal charges. They’d also approached her employer and other people that she knew to obtain information about her. “At this stage, they’re supposed to be just getting an account from you,” explains Fletcher. “And yet you turn up to an interview to find out they've already spoken to your associates and your employer, who may not have told you about it. It's embarrassing. You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but people think there's no smoke without fire, so your reputation is tarnished. Even before you’re charged with an offence.” According to the DWP’s employee handbook, benefit fraud cases are fed from the Department to journalists as part of a media strategy to increase visibility around these cases. “There is a procedure in place that says when you catch someone, you go and tell the tabloids,” explains Eva Blum-Dumontet, a senior researcher with Privacy International. Although details of the DWP’s coordination with media outlets is redacted, the systematic release of information about benefit fraud cases point to the Department’s role in perpetuating the myth of “benefit cheats” who take lavish vacations using taxpayer funds.The Privacy International report suggests that this kind of DWP evidence-gathering may be in violation of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), which dictates how the government can surveil and monitor UK residents. The DWP is only partially authorised to use investigation and data-gathering tactics, and is not legally permitted to use information obtained from those who know and have a relationship with the person under investigation – known as Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS) – who essentially act as informants. The DWP handbook acknowledges the legal limits around CHIS, but also offers 8 pages of guidance explaining how to gather information from them. “Under RIPA, they’re not allowed to use Covert Human Intelligence Sources,” says Blum-Dumontet. “And yet the guide is full of: ‘Oh, you're not allowed to use this. But hey, if you have a Covert Human Intelligence Source that suddenly comes at you, here is how you should handle that.’ It's very cheeky.”Fletcher says that from her experience working with claimants, DWP investigations are aggressive and often disproportionately severe. “The police don’t often use those powers that early in an investigation – whereas the DWP will.” Many benefit cases Fletcher works on include instances of social media monitoring, which the DWP justifies on the grounds that the personal data they use is considered open source. “Just because you've got mobility issues doesn't mean you're not entitled to public life or a social life. They’ll print off photographs that you have on there [social media] and put them to you in an interview.” The tactic often has the effect of being intimidating and invasive for claimants being scrutinised by the DWP.The investigations and breaches of privacy often take a heavy toll on claimants like Ellen. “She's quite frightened to leave the house,” says Fletcher. “She thinks that she's been watched all the time. She's scared to even go for a walk... it’s affected her family… It's affected her very badly.”Blum-Dumontet says that the DWP’s use of data from third-party sources, as well as the Department’s use of data-matching algorithms, is a particular cause for concern. “Who wouldn’t feel paranoid? Who wouldn’t feel paranoid about the idea that when you buy something online the company is going to be sharing their data with the state that's giving you money.” Along with financial institutions and airlines such as EasyJet, the DWP can also source information from eBay, supermarkets, leisure centres and gyms, the BBC, and certain Sky subscription services.The DWP’s staff guide notes: ""PayPal, a subsidiary of eBay, are willing to provide information in response to a standard DPA [Data Protection Act] letter...the standard DPA letter contains a suitable form of words to provide them with the assurances that the information is required for law enforcement purposes.”“It's not just privacy, it also goes against a very fundamental right to dignity,” says Blum-Dumontet, who says that Privacy International is still trying to uncover details about how the DWP flags claimants for investigation.Originally the DWP claimed that investigations were carried out when members of the public reported claimants through the DWP’s National Benefit Fraud Hotline. And in Ellen’s case, Fletcher says that she and Ellen suspect the investigation was triggered by a report to the DWP Hotline.But frontline workers and those familiar with the benefit system have suggested that the tip line – which allows neighbours and family members to report on those they believe are committing benefit fraud – is highly ineffective. An investigation by the Independent found that 87 percent of fraud reported through the tip line were dead ends that resulted in no action on the part of the Department. Interestingly, the DWP has suggested that it uses other methods to carry out fraud investigations as well. “When you go through the annual report of the DWP, there is quite a lot that's made about how they're developing this fancy artificial intelligence to cut down on fraud,” says Blum-Dumontet. The DWP’s 2018-19 annual report noted that the Department was “using increasingly sophisticated data and analytical tools” to weed out fraud. Last August a representative for the DWP’s “Intelligent Automation Garage”, a unit of the Department that works closely with private AI companies like UiPath, noted that the facility was working on fraud detection technology and that there was, “[s]ome really exciting stuff on the cards.”While an FOI request filed by Privacy International confirmed that the DWP was using data matching – what is essentially a simple algorithmic process – to flag benefit claimants for investigation, the DWP has been cagey about details. It’s unclear what behavioural patterns are triggering investigations. The DWP claims that revealing information about the fraud detection processes could potentially be used by criminals to carry out fraud. But Blum-Dumontet says the DWP needs to be more transparent about how it uses algorithms. “We are at a turning point in society where we’re waking up to the fact that we need transparency on these issues – that you can’t use AI without clear safeguards and a clear understanding of what data is being used. How is this system going to work? And the fact that at this very early stage [the DWP] is already refusing to comply with any requests of transparency should really worry us.”Labour Shadow Secretary for Work and Pensions Jonathan Reynolds expressed concern at the findings of the Privacy International report. “Labour believes in a compassionate social security system that treats people with the dignity they have every right to expect. Instead, we have a punitive Universal Credit system that is failing thousands of families who are unable to afford the essentials they need in this crisis.”Ellen’s fraud case is ongoing, but Fletcher says that they’re working to have the case dismissed. “It has long-lasting psychological effects on claimants. I think it makes them very wary of asking for help when they often need it the most. I think it's unnecessarily intrusive.”In a written statement a DWP spokesperson said: “Privacy International’s report grossly mischaracterises the use, and extent, of DWP powers, which are subject to independent scrutiny.“The limited powers that the Department does possess are used to prevent and detect potential crime, with surveillance conducted only when the Department is investigating potential fraud, and even then only in cases where all other relevant lines of enquiry have been exhausted.”The DWP also stated that “companies are not under any legal obligation to provide the requested data.”EasyJet declined to comment on specific data sharing practices but a representative for the company told VICE World News that “as a principle we only provide data in line with our legal obligations, including data protection.”A spokesperson for PayPal said: “PayPal only releases information to law enforcement authorities where there is a legal obligation to do so. This includes making sure that the request is correct, legitimate and lawful.”Blum-Dumontet questions whether the DWP is making it clear to companies that there is no legal obligation to share customer data with them. ""The very fact that [the DWP’s] guide written for their own staff list those companies with the type of data they can request suggests they know there is a fair chance that the data does get handed over.""When questioned on this point by VICE World News, the DWP declined to comment further."
196,FedEx pledges to go carbon-neutral by 2040 with EV delivery vans and more,Business,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/fedex-carbon-neutral-ev-delivery-vans/#ftag=CAD2124296,"The company responsible for moving so much around the US and the globe laid out a number of massive initiatives to reach its target.This battery-powered commercial van is sure to get couriers and delivery companies all hot and bothered.FedEx said on Wednesday it will do its part to cut emissions from its global business, which is a big deal for a corporation as sprawling as FedEx. The company said it's committed to become carbon-neutral by 2040 at the latest and laid out a number of projects and initiatives it will enact to meet its goal.Chief among them is tossing any delivery vehicle that runs on fossil fuels to the curb. By 2040, FedEx said its entire ground fleet will consist of zero-emissions electric vehicles. Purchases of electric vehicles will ramp up to 50% in 2025 before all vehicle purchases move to EV in 2030. By 2040, the last of its vehicles with an engine will exit service. Going carbon-neutral doesn't stop at filling out a fleet of electric delivery vehicles, however. FedEx already announced an initial purchase order for General Motors' upcoming BrightDrop EV600 electric delivery vans.The company said it will also work to transform its supply chains with ""carbon–neutral shipping offerings and sustainable packaging solutions,"" and promised to invest in alternative fuels for aircrafts and vehicles. Perhaps FedEx would like to know more about Porsche's E-Fuel project. In addition to alternative fuels, the FedEx also plans to invest in more renewable energy sources for its facilities and energy management programs to cut its carbon footprint inside its operations further. Total planned investment to make all of this happen is a cool $2 billion.All of this intertwines with a smaller part of the $2 billion planned: $100 million for Yale University to establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. The center will work on research to capture carbon more effectively, first focused on offsetting emissions from airlines. FedEx owns and operates the largest cargo airline in the world, so this is an important investment.FedEx proudly points out that since 2009, it pushed industry-releated emissions down 40%, but the company knows there's work to do. Like so many other companies, including major automakers, this decade is shaping up to be a transformational one for FedEx."

A Texas jury has ordered Intel to pay $2.18 billion in damages for infringing two patents. The lawsuit was filed by VLSI Technology LLC, a 4-year-old firm that Intel says has no products and no sources of revenue besides patent litigation.The patents at issue in the case previously belonged to NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch company that spun off from Philips in 2006. NXP acquired the patents when it bought Freescale Semiconductor (itself a spinoff of Motorola) in 2015. Intel's lawyer told jurors that NXP would get a portion of the proceeds from the lawsuit.The two patents focus on methods for minimizing the power consumption of computing chips. One way to do this is by varying the system voltage: setting a higher voltage when high performance is needed, then lowering the voltage to conserve power afterward. One patent claims the concept of storing information about a memory chip's minimum voltage in nonvolatile memory so the system can ensure that the memory circuit has a high enough voltage.VLSI's other patent focuses on altering clock frequencies as a power-saving technique. Once again, raising the clock frequency of an electrical bus can increase system performance but consume more power. NXP's second patent is based on the idea that a device on a bus can request a change to the clock frequency when it needs faster performance.At trial, Intel argued that it hadn't copied these techniques from NXP or Freescale and that, in fact, Intel had invented its own, more sophisticated, techniques to accomplish these objectives. But a jury in Waco, Texas wasn't convinced.Intel had tried to get the trial postponed, arguing to a federal appeals court that COVID-19 rates in the Waco area were too high to hold the trial safely. The company also argued that it would be better to hold the trial in Austin, where Intel has a campus. But with the Austin courtroom closed, Judge Alan Albright decided to hold the case in Waco. In January, the Federal Circuit Appeals Court gave the green light.The case isn't over. Intel may ask the judge to find that the jury misapplied the law. If that fails, Intel will then have the opportunity to appeal the case. If the ruling is upheld, it would be one of the largest patent judgments in US history.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

198,Indian state government website exposed COVID-19 lab test results,Privacy,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/india-west-bengal-health-covid-security/,"A security flaw in a website run by the government of West Bengal in India exposed the lab results of at least hundreds of thousands of residents, though likely millions, who took a COVID-19 test.The website is part of the West Bengal government’s mass coronavirus testing program. Once a COVID-19 test result is ready, the government sends a text message to the patient with a link to its website containing their test results.But security researcher Sourajeet Majumder found that the link containing the patient’s unique test identification number was scrambled with base64 encoding, which can be easily converted using online tools. Because the identification numbers were incrementally sequenced, the website bug meant that anyone could change that number in their browser’s address bar and view other patients’ test results.The test results contain the patient’s name, sex, age, postal address and if the patient’s lab test result came back positive, negative or inconclusive for COVID-19.Majumder told TechCrunch that he was concerned a malicious attacker could scrape the site and sell the data. “This is a privacy violation if somebody else gets access to my private information,” he said.Two redacted COVID-19 lab test results exposed as a result of a security vulnerability on the West Bengal government’s website. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)Majumder reported the vulnerability to India’s CERT, the country’s dedicated cybersecurity response unit, which acknowledged the issue in an email. He also contacted the West Bengal government’s website manager, who did not respond. TechCrunch independently confirmed the vulnerability and also reached out to the West Bengal government, which pulled the website offline, but did not return our requests for comment.TechCrunch held our report until the vulnerability was fixed or no longer presented a risk. At the time of publication, the affected website remains offline.It’s not known exactly how many COVID-19 lab results were exposed because of this security lapse, or if anyone other than Majumder discovered the vulnerability. At the time the website was pulled offline at the end of February, the state government had tested more than 8.5 million residents for COVID-19.Dr Lal PathLabs, one of India’s largest blood test labs, exposed patient dataWest Bengal is one of the most populated states of India, with about 90 million residents. Since the start of the pandemic, the state government has recorded more than 10,000 coronavirus deaths.It’s the latest of several security incidents in the past few months to hit India and its response to the coronavirus pandemic.Last May, India’s largest cell network Jio admitted a security lapse after a security researcher found a database containing the company’s coronavirus symptom checker, which Jio had launched months earlier.In October, a security researcher found Dr Lal PathLabs left hundreds of spreadsheets containing millions of patient booking records — including for COVID-19 tests — on a public storage server that was not protected with a password, allowing anyone to access sensitive patient data.Send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.

Last week, in a sudden move that will have disastrous consequences for the open internet, the Indian government notified a new regime for intermediary liability and digital media regulation. Intermediary liability (or “safe harbor”) protections have been fundamental to growth and innovation on the internet as an open and secure medium of communication and commerce. By expanding the “due diligence” obligations that intermediaries will have to follow to avail safe harbor, these rules will harm end to end encryption, substantially increase surveillance, promote automated filtering and prompt a fragmentation of the internet that would harm users while failing to empower Indians. While many of the most onerous provisions only apply to “significant social media intermediaries” (a new classification scheme), the ripple effects of these provisions will have a devastating impact on freedom of expression, privacy and security.As we explain below, the current rules are not fit-for-purpose and will have a series of unintended consequences on the health of the internet as a whole:The final rules do contain some improvements from the 2011 original law and the 2018 draft such as limiting the scope of some provisions to significant social media intermediaries, user and public transparency requirements, due process checks and balances around traceability requests, limiting the automated filtering provision and an explicit recognition of the “good samaritan” principle for voluntary enforcement of platform guidelines. In their overall scope, however, they are a dangerous precedent for internet regulation and need urgent reform.Ultimately, illegal and harmful content on the web, the lack of sufficient accountability  and substandard responses to it undermine the overall health of the internet and as such, are a core concern for Mozilla. We have been at the forefront of these conversations globally (such as the UK, EU and even the 2018 version of this draft in India), pushing for approaches that manage the harms of illegal content online within a rights-protective framework. The regulation of speech online necessarily calls into play numerous fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Indian constitution (freedom of speech, right to privacy, due process, etc), as well as crucial technical considerations (‘does the architecture of the internet render this type of measure possible or not’, etc). This is a delicate and critical balance, and not one that should be approached with blunt policy proposals.These rules are already binding law, with the provisions for significant social media intermediaries coming into force 3 months from now (approximately late May 2021). Given the many new provisions in these rules, we recommend that they should be withdrawn and be accompanied by wide ranging and participatory consultations with all relevant stakeholders prior to notification.

""Scotland deserves better,"" read another.The Russian network included 530 fake Instagram accounts originating primarily in Russia and targeting domestic audiences in connection with recent protests in support of Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist and opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin. As many as 50,000 people followed one or more of the accounts.The Russian network used techniques known as ""hashtag poisoning"" and ""location poisoning,"" posting large volumes of irrelevant or critical content to particular hashtags and location tags to drown out pertinent information and redirect the conversation, Facebook said.Some of the location tags included places where protesters planned to gather in Moscow and St. Petersburg on Jan. 23 and Jan. 31, and later near Moscow City Court, Facebook said.For profile pictures, Facebook said, the Russian accounts used celebrity or computer-generated photos, and the accounts appeared to have been created in bulk and purchased from a third-party broker.The accounts seemed designed to dissuade protesters. One posted in January about the risk of catching the Covid-19 virus.""Went to the protest on January 23 — now grandfather is on ventilator,"" it said.The fake accounts were quickly detected by Facebook's automated systems and shut down, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, told NBC News.""They weren't very effective,"" he said, but publicizing them provides useful insights into how foreign propaganda networks function and what messaging they employ.Facebook didn't formally attribute the activity to the Iranian and Russian governments.Ken Dilanian is a correspondent covering intelligence and national security for the NBC News Investigative Unit.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
202,How Technology Is Changing The Job Of The Sales Professional,ADBLOCK WARNING,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/03/02/how-technology-is-changing-the-job-of-the-sales-professional/?sh=79b891782572,"Entrepreneur | Bootstrapped to €3M ARR in just 1year | Founder of Worlds safest software for LinkedIn Automation Expandi.io | Vegan | FathergettyModern technologies are rapidly changing the marketing industry. We now have more ways to get customer data and leverage that data to provide personalized messages that are tailored to our customer's stage in the purchase process. What does this mean for the modern sales professional?Today, a salesperson can reach out to more leads, with more knowledge about those leads and with the best possible message that will be more likely to convert. Some sales automation tools even provide many of these features in one place. (Full disclosure, my company offers sales automation tools, as do many others.)Here's how a more technological approach differs from traditional sales and how it can help you improve your social media prospecting and other outbound efforts.Traditional Vs. Modern SalesThe old-school image of salespeople, as depicted in movies like Glengarry Glen Ross, usually shows them as outgoing, almost pushy people that won't take ""no"" for an answer. They use things like cold-calling, scripts and closing techniques to convince people they need their service or product. Closing a sale means going through a high-pressure process in which your prospects often won’t even talk to you.Back then, it really was all about volume. You'd take your address book and call prospects until you met your daily quota. With the advance of user data and modern technologies, the paradigm has shifted.It's not about volume anymore; it's about providing value to the customer and only contacting those people who are potentially interested in your offer. Sales professionals don't have to waste time on low-quality leads that will most likely end up rejecting them. Instead, they can do their best to find those people that are in their target audience, leverage the data and reach out to them with the right messages.New Ways To Find LeadsModern technology has equipped us with new ways to find quality leads. You can now use various tools to search for prospects that have already displayed an interest in your industry. Many companies (67%) use lead generation as a metric to determine their success, so making this a priority can be an important move.Here are some ways to hunt leads that weren't available a decade ago:• LinkedIn Sales Navigator. LinkedIn's sales tool is a great place to conduct complex searches and find your prospects. You can use filters to narrow down your search results by education, employer (current and former), location, job title and numerous other criteria. This allows you to get specific results and filter your search to the point that all your results fit your audience persona almost perfectly.• Email hunters. You can now find almost anyone's email. All you need is their name, last name and current company. There are lots of email hunter tools that allow you to get this information online. Years ago, this was impossible. Today, you have all these leads just a few clicks away.• Scrape contacts. Some sales automation tools allow you to scrape contacts from all sorts of lists. For example, you can join a Facebook group from your industry and scrape all the members to use them as potential leads. You can also scrape all the people who commented on a specific LinkedIn post. The opportunities are endless if you do your research right and know where to find leads.All of these technologies are geared toward one thing: giving you the highest quality leads available. Once you have those, you're ready to go into smart outreach.Outreach With Sales AutomationCold-calling is a painstaking process that takes a lot of time and consumes a lot of energy. The same can be said for social media or email outreach if you do them manually. Instead of reaching out to each lead with a custom message created from scratch, now you can use automation to handle multiple prospects in record time.It used to be that you had to sacrifice some quality if you wanted to go into sales process automation. Today, these intelligent tools allow you to create smart flows that feel natural to the prospect. From my experience with working with companies, you can reach out with personalized, automated messages that are almost impossible to tell apart from the ones you wrote from scratch.More importantly, some of these tools use advanced personalization techniques, and we know that personalization can have a profound effect on profits and customer lifetime value.In ConclusionThe job of a sales professional in 2021 could be considered both easier and more purposeful than it used to be. Traditional sales calls have transformed into data-based interactions where you're confident you have something to offer. In my opinion, knowing that you're talking to someone from your industry who displayed some interest in products similar to yours is also bound to make your job more enjoyable. However, keep in mind that sales automation tools won't do all the work. You still have to be skillful when it comes to both finding leads and creating messages that convert.Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

203,Technology investments for a remote workforce,Business,https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/technology-investments-for-a-remote-workforce/105178/,"The challenges of COVID-19 have brought a sharp focus on technology investments. Everyone knows that tech investments are a good thing, right? But as a Business Leader, how do you know that the investments you make give you the best bang for your buck?And when you have a workforce that is almost totally remote, how do you organise them to ensure success?For a number of years now, there have been changes in the way technology is created. The advent of the cloud has brought access to really good, working enterprise technology within reach of every organisation. We can all relate to and marvel at, the speed at which almost every business has been able to access enterprise-grade video collaboration tools. Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, etc., have been simple to access and for the most part, they have just worked. No longer does IT need seven months to plan and build a service. A credit card can switch it on in moments.But this success has brought new challenges. Now we have access to amazing tools, easily and cheaply, what is the best way to use them? What is the best way to drive business value?Xonetic helps organisations combine the latest cloud technologies (Products) with modern ways of working (Business Technology). If you have the right products and you apply them in the correct way, you can dramatically improve your effectiveness as a business. We call this Digital Energy, and Xonetic exists to help organisations gain maximum benefit from it.There are some simple ideas to follow that work well with our customers:Specifically, ones that bring the best of breed functional capability. They are so easy to deploy that the traditional time spent first buying a package and then customising it for the business are reduced from years to months. Do not build an HR tool. Buy one.Remember, though! Buying more business tools requires a different team focus – you will need a better legal and commercial understanding in your tech teams to allow you to spin up contracts as and when needed.The huge benefit of all of this is that time is freed up for the organisation to think about how business tools are arranged in terms of creating business value trains and not into the act of implementing the tools themselves.A digital mindset places the customer at the heart of every action. Think about this for a moment, are you really certain that every person in your business understands how their efforts contribute to customer happiness?This is not a simple switch from measuring one thing to another. The business of measuring tasks, running projects, managing change incrementally, are all skills that are vital to an organisation’s success. However, if the importance of the tasks themselves is the main focus rather than the outcomes, then the value is lost. I have personally worked on many projects with a great name, Horizon, Phoenix, Vision, where the link to the value is not easy to spot. I sense that a large ERP project will help the customer, but I do not know it.The shift in mindset is subtle, the emphasis is placed on tooling to measure the success of task activities, such as DevOps, whilst organisational attention is moved to the creation of value streams. This is a vital concept – keep measuring tasks. But don’t use people to do it – automate and then automate some more.Deciding on the value streams themselves should not be a monumental task, rather start small and then iterate to see what sticks. Virtual teams should be created to support the value streams; this is not an exercise in changing job titles and team structures – although this will come over time as the organisation learns.Teams that are familiar with agile development techniques will be familiar with the concept of value streams – however, many activities within an organisation do not lend themselves to being managed iteratively and are more sequential in nature. So the trick here is not just to “do agile”, but rather think about how to organise around value.For example, one of our customers is a large European retailer, who is opening a store every single day (even at the moment!). This type of activity requires well defined sequential plans which are not agile in nature. Having implemented our Business Technology Operating model, their activity is measured by value – this is part of a value stream that is based around the customer experience, that also drives the customer online experience so that they are in tandem, in lockstep with the physical approach.The Business Technology framework is now in its 11th year and has been used by many hundreds of companies across the Nordics to harness Digital Energy. Open source and developed continuously by the community, it represents battle-tested strategies and ways of working. Our expertise and training academy offers the opportunity to access this model at your own pace. Self-led, guided or consulting-led models (or a blend of all three) are available depending on what works best for your business.So coming back to the distributed nature of teams. By measuring value and not tasks, employees can deeply connect with the nature of the work they are doing which helps with morale and focus. Organisations can focus on value – not what an individual did today, but use metrics like the average value created every month. You can start to measure and predict the value that your teams will deliver, and this allows you to identify areas that need support, to improve the predictability of results. This approach is holistic, inclusive and does not worry about measuring individual tasks.At its heart, Digital Modernisation is about improving your customer experience. We define Digital Energy as the combination of highly digital and automated business applications and tools, combined with Industry-leading ways of working, practices and techniques.If you would like to understand more about our open-source best practice knowledge, training and advisory services then please drop in for a virtual coffee or register for a free seminar. Please note: This is a commercial profileSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Ari Natter, Bloomberg News(Bloomberg) -- Jennifer Granholm used her first speech as U.S. Energy Secretary to warn oil and gas companies they risk being left behind unless they embrace a transition to cleaner sources of energy, while also offering them an opportunity to partner with the new administration.“I’m not going to sugarcoat how hard transitions are,” Granholm said Wednesday during IHS Markit’s annual CERAWeek conference. “The bottom line is this particular growth of clean energy and reduction of carbon provides a huge opportunity and I’m extending a hand of partnership.”Granholm’s remarks come as the Biden administration seeks to reassure hundreds of thousands of workers in oil, gas, and coal who feel imperiled by his fight against climate change, which includes a plan to rid the economy of carbon emissions by 2050. Biden has vowed not to leave any worker behind during this transition to a cleaner economy, but has been met with skepticism in the oil patch and elsewhere.Granholm, who formerly served as the governor of Michigan, was confirmed last month to lead the Energy Department, an agency with a roughly $35 billion annual budget and a diverse mission that ranges from helping to build the nation’s arsenal of nuclear warheads to spending billions researching new energy technology.Granholm has said she will draw on her experience revitalizing Michigan’s economy after the 2008 recession, and has vowed to focus on creating new jobs during the clean-energy transition. Some lawmakers representing fossil fuel-producing states have been critical.“The Biden administration is telling these oil rig, coal mine, and well workers that they can simply get new jobs ‘building solar panels’,” Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso said last month. “Their livelihoods are being sacrificed in the name of the Biden agenda.”In her remarks at the conference, which is being held virtually this year, Granholm said the Biden administration has created a new Office of Energy Jobs to help fossil fuel employees identify new opportunities. Among the examples Granholm cited was oil and gas workers using their drilling skills to tap into geothermal energy and sheet metal workers reinforcing pipelines to protect against methane leaks.Granholm praised oil and gas companies that have already vowed to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.“The market is raising its hand and saying we are heading in a direction you better come along or you are going to be left behind,” Granholm said. “Maybe we should listen to some of those signals and it’s an opportunity for those who work in these sectors to work with us to diversify into clean energy solutions.”©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Wrigley Heir latest to tap SPAC frenzy to take U.S. pot firm publicCannabis retailer Verano CEO: We have always made money U.S. cannabis operator Verano Holdings soars in trading debut"

Google is opening up its alternative ad-targeting tool for public tests, taking its next steps towards creating a ""privacy-first"" online world devoid of third-party cookies and with stronger controls over how personal data should be collected and used. It hopes the tests will offer deeper insights on how well the interest-based targeting tool will work in diverse regions such as Asia. Fuelled by a goal to deliver more relevant ads to consumers, businesses worldwide had been collecting voluminous user data typically via third-party cookies. This had eroded consumer trust, David Temkin, Google's director of product management for ads privacy and trust, said in a blog post Wednesday. Also: Google patches actively exploited Chrome browser zero-dayCiting research from Pew Research Centre, Google said 72% of consumers believed almost everything they did online was tracked by advertisers, tech companies, and other organisations. Another 81% said potential risks they faced due to the data collection outweighed the benefits. In fact, 40% would stop buying services from a company over privacy concerns and there had been a 50% spike year-on-year in searches for online privacy. Temkin said: ""If digital advertising doesn't evolve to address the growing concerns people have about their privacy and how their personal identity is being used, we risk the future of the free and open web.""This pushed the US tech giant to put together a two-year plan to phase out third-party cookies, which included working with industry players, publishers, and marketers on its Privacy Sandbox initiative to come up with tools that could strike a better balance between user privacy and ad revenue. Excluded from such efforts was any attempts to build alternative identifiers to track users as they browsed the web, he said, stressing that Google had no plans to use these in its products.  ""Instead, our web products will be powered by privacy-preserving APIs that prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers,"" he added. ""People shouldn't have to accept being tracked across the web in order to get the benefits of relevant advertising and advertisers don't need to track individual consumers across the web to get the performance benefits of digital advertising.""In particular, Google believes a technology it built offered a viable alternative to third-party cookies by grouping or ""hiding"" individuals amongst large crowds of people who shared similar interests. Called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), the platform removed the need for individual identifiers whilst still enabling brands to reach people with relevant content and ads by targeting clusters of people with common interests. It would help keep an individual's web history private. Google said its tests so far indicated that FLoC yielded a conversion rate of at least 95% for every ad dollar, compared to cookie-based advertising. Results varied according to the clustering algorithm the FLoC used and types of audience targeted.  Asked whether it would work as well in diverse markets such as Asia, Google told ZDNet that this was what it now hoped to determine by opening up the tool for pilots.The US tech giant said it would release FLoC for developer trials later this month, before extending the tests to include advertisers on Google Ads next quarter. In addition, it would introduce its first iteration of new user controls next month with simple ""on/off"" options in its Chrome 90 release, with plans to expand these controls in future releases. Commenting on scepticism that these efforts simply were attempts to create a walled garden, Google noted that it, too, would be impacted by the change since several of its own products including Google Ads and Display & Video 360 tapped cookies. It added that Chrome had a responsibility to protect the privacy of its users as they accessed content via the web browser and, at the same time, believed in an ad-supported ecosystem. It said both could be achieved by working with advertisers, brands, and industry players to roll out alternative technology that did not track individuals. It acknowledged that some organisations could continue to circumvent efforts to do so, for example, by using fingerprinting and other tracking devices to identify individuals. It urged brands to build on their first-party data as a way to improve their engagement with consumers. Citing its commissioned research with Boston Consulting Group, Google said brands in Asia that used first-party data to create personalised experiences achieved on average 11% higher incremental annual revenue and 18% more cost savings. It added that organisations could still deliver personalised engagement through contextual-based ads, tapping anonymised and first-party data and without impacting user privacy. Temkin said: ""Developing strong relationships with customers has always been critical for brands to build a successful business and this becomes even more vital in a privacy-first world. We will continue to support first-party relationships on our ad platforms for partners, in which they have direct connections with their own customers, and we'll deepen our support for solutions that build on these direct relationships between consumers and the brands and publishers they engage with.""He added that third-party cookies and any technology that tracked individuals should be eradicated to maintain an ""open and accessible"" internet in which user privacy was safeguarded.  Temkin said: ""There is no need to sacrifice relevant advertising and monetisation in order to deliver a private and secure experience.""Google noted that cookies-based ad delivery would continue to be used on its platforms until next year, after its new tools were fully tested and ready for rollout. When it does, it will follow in the footsteps of Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox, which have blocked third-party cookies by default on their platforms.

The founder of the far-right social media platform Gab said that the private account of former President Donald Trump was among the data stolen and publicly released by hackers who recently breached the site.In a statement on Sunday, founder Andrew Torba used a transphobic slur to refer to Emma Best, the co-founder of Distributed Denial of Secrets. The statement confirmed claims the WikiLeaks-style group made on Monday that it obtained 70GB of passwords, private posts, and more from Gab and was making them available to select researchers and journalists. The data, Best said, was provided by an unidentified hacker who breached Gab by exploiting a SQL-injection vulnerability in its code.""My account and Trump's account were compromised, of course as Trump is about to go on stage and speak,"" Torba wrote on Sunday as Trump was about to speak at the CPAC conference in Florida. ""The entire company is all hands investigating what happened and working to trace and patch the problem.""GabLeaks, as DDoSecrets is calling the leak, comes almost eight weeks after pro-Trump insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol. The rioters took hundreds of thousands of videos and photos of the siege and posted them online. Mainstream social media sites removed much of the content because it violated their terms of service.""The Gab data is an important, but complicated dataset,"" DDoSecrets personnel wrote in a post on Monday morning. ""In addition to being a corpus of the public discourse on Gab, it includes every private post and many private messages, as well. In a simpler or more ordinary time, it'd be an important sociological resource. In 2021, it's also a record of the culture and the exact statements surrounding not only an increase in extremist views and actions, but an attempted coup.""Gab and a competing site called Parler were some of the last refuges that allowed much of the content to remain publicly available. Amazon and web hosting providers later cited a lack of adequate content moderation in suspending service to Parler.While law enforcement groups likely had other ways to obtain the Parler data, its public availability enabled a much wider body of people to do their own research and investigations. The leak was especially valuable because materials contained metadata that's usually stripped out before users can download videos and images. The metadata gave people the ability to track the precise timelines and locations of filmed participants.DDoSecrets said that the 70GB GabLeaks contains over 70,000 plaintext messages in more than 19,000 chats by over 15,000 users. The dump also shows passwords that are ""hashed,"" a cryptographic process that converts plaintext into unintelligible characters. While hashes can't be converted back into plaintext, cracking them can be trivial when websites choose weak hashing schemes. (Best told Ars they didn't know what hashing scheme was used.) The leak also includes plaintext passwords for user groups.Gab has long been criticized as a haven for hate speech. In 2018, Google banned the Gab app from its Play Store for terms of service violations. A year later, web host GoDaddy terminated service to Gab after one of its users took to the site to criticize the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society shortly before killing 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.Gab has also been investigated by Pennsylvania's attorney general. In January, the Anti-Defamation League called on the US Justice Department to investigate Gab for its role in the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol.Attempts to reach Torba for comment didn't succeed.Best said that DDoSecrets is making GabLeaks available only to journalists and researchers with a documented history of covering leaks.

208,Naomi Klein: how big tech helps India target climate activists,Politics,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/mar/04/how-big-tech-helps-india-target-climate-activists-naomi-klein,"Companies such as Google and Facebook appear to be aiding and abetting a vicious government campaign against Indian environmental campaignersThe bank of cameras camped outside Delhi’s sprawling Tihar jail was the sort of media frenzy you would expect to await a prime minister caught in an embezzlement scandal, or a Bollywood star caught in the wrong bed. Instead, the cameras were waiting for Disha Ravi, a nature-loving 22-year-old vegan climate activist who against all odds has found herself ensnared in an Orwellian legal saga that includes accusations of sedition, incitement and involvement in an international conspiracy whose elements include (but are not limited to): Indian farmers in revolt, the global pop star Rihanna, supposed plots against yoga and chai, Sikh separatism and Greta Thunberg.If you think that sounds far-fetched, well, so did the judge who released Ravi after nine days in jail under police interrogation. Judge Dharmender Rana was supposed to rule on whether Ravi, one of the founders of the Indian chapter of Fridays for Future, the youth climate group started by Thunberg, should continue to be denied bail. He ruled that there was no reason for bail to be denied, which cleared the way for Ravi’s return to her home in Bengaluru that night.But the judge also felt the need to go much further, to issue a scathing 18-page ruling on the underlying case that has gripped Indian media for weeks, issuing his own personal verdict on the various explanations provided by the Delhi police for why Ravi had been apprehended in the first place. The police’s evidence against the young climate activist is, he wrote, “scanty and sketchy”, and there is not “even an iota” of proof to support the claims of sedition, incitement or conspiracy that have been levelled against her and at least two other young activists.Though the international conspiracy case appears to be falling apart, Ravi’s arrest has spotlighted a different kind of collusion, this one between the increasingly oppressive and anti-democratic Hindu nationalist government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Silicon Valley companies whose tools and platforms have become the primary means for government forces to incite hatred against vulnerable minorities and critics – and for police to ensnare peaceful activists like Ravi in a hi-tech digital web.The case against Ravi and her “co-conspirators” hinges entirely on routine uses of well-known digital tools: WhatsApp groups, a collectively edited Google Doc, a private Zoom meeting and several high-profile tweets, all of which have been weaponised into key pieces of alleged evidence in a state-sponsored and media-amplified activist hunt. At the same time, these very tools have been used in a coordinated pro-government messaging campaign to turn public sentiment against the young activists and the movement of farmers they came together to support, often in clear violation of the guardrails social media companies claim to have erected to prevent violent incitement on their platforms.In a country where online hatred has tipped with chilling frequency into real-world pogroms targeting women and minorities, human rights advocates are warning that India is on the knife-edge of terrible violence, perhaps even the kind of genocidal bloodshed that social media aided and abetted against the Rohingya in Myanmar.Through it all, the giants of Silicon Valley have stayed conspicuously silent. Their famed devotion to free expression, as well as their newfound commitment to battling hate speech and conspiracy theories, is, in India, nowhere to be found. In its place is a growing and chilling complicity with Modi’s information war, a collaboration that is poised to be locked in under a draconian new digital media law that will make it illegal for tech companies to refuse to cooperate with government requests to take down offending material or to breach the privacy of tech users. Complicity in human rights abuses, it seems, is the price of retaining access to the largest market of digital media users outside China.After some early resistance from the company, Twitter accounts critical of the Modi government have disappeared in the hundreds without explanation; government officials engaging in bald incitement and overt hate speech on Twitter and Facebook have been permitted to continue in clear violation of the companies’ policies; and Delhi police boast that they are getting plenty of helpful cooperation from Google as they dig through the private communications of peaceful climate activists like Ravi.“The silence of these companies speaks volumes,” a digital rights activist told me, requesting anonymity out of fear of retribution. “They have to take a stand, and they have to do it now.”Referred to in the Indian press variously as the “toolkit case”, the “Greta toolkit”, and the “toolkit conspiracy”, the police’s ongoing investigation of Ravi, along with fellow activists Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk, centres on the contents of a social media guide that Thunberg tweeted to her nearly 5 million followers in early February. When Ravi was arrested, the Delhi police declared that she “is an editor of the Toolkit Google Doc & key conspirator in document’s formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc.”The kit was nothing more than a Google Doc put together by an ad hoc collection of activists in India and the diaspora designed to generate support for the movement of farmers that has been staging enormous and relentless protests for months.The farmers oppose a set of new agricultural laws that Modi’s government rushed through under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic. At the heart of the protests is the belief that by doing away with longtime price protections for crops and opening up the agricultural sector to more private investment, small farmers will face a “death warrant”, and India’s fertile lands will fall into the hands of a few large corporate players.Many non-farmers have looked for ways to help, in India and in the global south-Asian diaspora, as well as more broadly. The youth-led climate movement felt a particular responsibility to step up. As Ravi said in court, she supports the farmers “because they are our future, and we all need to eat”. And she has also pointed to a climate connection. Drought, heatwaves and flooding have all grown more intense in recent years, and India’s farmers are on the frontlines of these climate impacts, often losing their crops and livelihoods, experiences Ravi knows about first-hand from witnessing her farmer grandparents struggle with weather extremes.Much like countless such documents of the digital organising age, the toolkit at the centre of this controversy contains a buffet of familiar suggestions for how people can express their solidarity with India’s farmers, mainly on social media. “Tweet your support to the Indian Farmers. Use hashtag #FarmersProtest #StandWithFarmers”; take a picture or a video of yourself saying you support the farmers; sign a petition; write to your representative; participate in a “tweetstorm” or “digital strike”; attend one of the protests in person, whether inside India or at an Indian embassy in your country; learn more by attending a Zoom information session. An early version of the document (soon deleted) talked about challenging India’s peace-and-love, or “yoga & chai”, public image.Pretty much every major activist campaign generates “clicktivist” how-to guides exactly like this one. Most mid-sized nongovernmental organisations have someone whose job it is to draft such documents and send them to potential supporters and “influencers”. If they are illegal, then contemporary activism itself is illegal. By arresting and imprisoning Ravi for an alleged role as an editor of the toolkit, she is in essence being criminalised for making India look bad in front of the world. Under that definition, all international human rights work would need to be shut down, since that work rarely presents governments in a flattering light.This point was made forcefully by the judge who ruled on Ravi’s bail: “Citizens are conscience keepers of government in any democratic Nation. They cannot be put behind the bars simply because they choose to disagree with the state policies,” he wrote. As for sharing the toolkit with Thunberg, “the freedom of speech and expression includes the right to seek a global audience”.This seems obvious. Yet somehow this most benign of documents has been latched on to by multiple government officials as something far more nefarious. Gen VK Singh, Modi’s minister of state for road transport and highways, wrote in a Facebook post that the toolkit “revealed the real designs of a conspiracy at an international level against India. Need to investigate the parties which are pulling the strings of this evil machinery. Instructions were laid out clearly as to the ‘how’, ‘when’ and ‘what’. Conspiracies at this scale often get exposed.”The Delhi police quickly took its cue and set out to find evidence of this international conspiracy to “defame the country” and undermine the government, using a draconian colonial-era sedition law. But it didn’t stop there. The toolkit also stands accused of being part of a secret plot to break India apart and form a Sikh state called Khalistan (more sedition), because a Vancouver-based Indo-Canadian who helped put it together has expressed some sympathy for the idea of an independent Sikh homeland (not a crime and nowhere mentioned in the toolkit). And remarkably, for one Google Doc that the police claim was mainly written in Canada, this same toolkit stands accused of inciting and possibly plotting violence at a large farmers’ “tractor rally” in Delhi on 26 January.For weeks, these claims have gone viral online, much of it under coordinated hashtag campaigns spearheaded by India’s Ministry of External Affairs and faithfully echoed by top Bollywood and cricket stars. Anil Vij, a government minister in the state of Haryana, tweeted in Hindi that “Whoever has seeds of anti-nationalism in their mind has to be destroyed from the roots, be it #Disha_Ravi or anyone else.” Challenged as an obvious example of hate speech by a powerful figure, Twitter claimed that the post did not violate its policies and left it up.Indian print and broadcast media has relentlessly echoed the preposterous charges of sedition, with well more than 100 stories about Ravi and the toolkit appearing in the Times of India alone. Television news shows have run crime-stopper-style exposés of the international toolkit “conspiracy.” Not surprisingly, the rage has spilled out into the streets, with photos of Thunberg and Rihanna (who also tweeted in support of the farmers) burned at nationalist rallies.Modi himself has even weighed in, speaking of enemies who have “stooped so low that they are not sparing even Indian tea” – widely taken as a reference to the deleted “yoga & chai” line.And then, last month, the whole frothy mess seemed to fall flat. Rana, in his order releasing Ravi, wrote that “perusal of the said ‘Toolkit’ reveals that any call for any kind of violence is conspicuously absent”. The claim that the kit was a secessionist plot was also entirely unproven, he wrote, an elaborate guilt-by-association inference.As for the charge that disseminating critical information about India’s treatment of farmers and human rights defenders to prominent activists like Thunberg constitutes “sedition”, the judge was particularly harsh. “The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments.”The case is ongoing, but the ruling represents a major blow to the government and a vindication for the farmer’s movement and the solidarity campaigns supporting them. However, it is hardly a victory. Even if the toolkit case loses steam as a result of the judge’s slapdown, it is just one of hundreds of campaigns that the Indian government is waging to hunt down activists, organisers and journalists. The labour organiser Nodeep Kaur, one year older than Ravi, was also jailed for her support of the farmers. Just released on bail, Kaur claimed in court that she had been badly beaten while in police custody. Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers remain behind bars and some of those arrested have disappeared.The real threat that the toolkit represented to Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, or BJP, was always, at root, about the power of the farmers’ movement. Modi’s political project represents a powerful merger of unleashed Hindu chauvinism with highly concentrated corporate power. The farmers challenge that dual project, both in their insistence that food should stay outside market logics and in the movement’s proven ability to build power across the religious, ethnic and geographic divisions that are the lifeblood of Modi’s rise to power.Ravinder Kaur, a professor at the University of Copenhagen and the author of Brand New Nation: Capitalist Dreams and Nationalist Designs in Twenty-First-Century India, writes that the farmers are “perhaps the largest mass mobilisation in post-colonial India’s history, one that spans rural and urban populations, and conjoins the revolt against deregulated capitalism to the struggle for civil liberties”. For Modi’s powerful merger of transnational capital with a hypernationalistic state, “the anti-farm law mobilisation poses the most sustained and direct challenge to this alliance yet”.Protests by farmers in and around Delhi have been met with water cannon, teargas and mass arrests. But they keep coming, too big to defeat with force alone. That is why the Modi government has been so determined to find ways to undermine the movement and suppress its message, repeatedly blocking the internet ahead of protests and successfully pressuring Twitter to cancel more than 1,000 pro-farmer accounts. It is also why Modi has sought to muddy the waters with tales of devious toolkits and international conspiracies.An open letter signed by dozens of Indian environmental activists after Ravi’s arrest made this point: “[T]he current actions of the Central Government are diversionary tactics to distract people from real issues like the ever-rising cost of fuel and essential items, the widespread unemployment and distress caused due to the lockdown without a plan, and the alarming state of the environment.”It is this quest for a political diversion, in other words, that helps explain how a simple solidarity campaign has been recast as a secret plot to break India apart and incite violence from abroad. The Modi government is attempting to drag the public debate away from terrain where it is glaringly weak – meeting people’s basic needs during an economic crisis and pandemic – and move it to the ground on which every ethnonationalist project thrives: us versus them, insiders versus outsiders, patriots versus seditious traitors.In this familiar manoeuvre, Ravi and the broader youth climate movement were simply collateral damage. Yet the damage done is considerable, and not only because the interrogations are ongoing and Ravi’s return to jail remains distinctly possible. As the joint letter from Indian environmental advocates states, her arrest and imprisonment have already served a purpose: “The Government’s heavy handedness are clearly focused on terrorising and traumatising these brave young people for speaking truth to power, and amounts to teaching them a lesson.”The still wider damage is in the chill the entire toolkit controversy has placed over political dissent in India – with the silent complicity of the tech companies that once touted their powers to open up closed societies and spread democracy around the world. As one headline put it, “Disha Ravi arrest puts privacy of all Google India users in doubt”.Indeed, public debate has been so deeply compromised that many activists in India are going underground, deleting their own social media accounts to protect themselves. Even digital rights advocates are wary of being quoted on the record. Asking not to be named, a legal researcher described a dangerous convergence between a government adept at information war and social media companies built on maximising engagement to mine their users’ data: “All of this stems from a stronger weaponisation of social media platforms by the status quo, something that was not present earlier. This is further aggravated by the tendency of these companies to prioritise more viral, extremist content, which allows them to monetise user attention, ultimately benefiting their profit motives.”Since her arrest, the entrails of Ravi’s private digital life have been laid out for all to see, picked over by a voracious and salacious national media. Televised panels and newspapers obsessed over her private text messages to Thunberg as well as other communications among activists who were doing nothing but editing an online pamphlet. Police, meanwhile, have repeatedly insisted that Ravi’s decision to delete a WhatsApp group was proof that she had committed a crime, rather than a rational response to government attempts to turn peaceful digital organising into a weapon directed at young activists.Ravi’s lawyers have asked the court to order the police to stop leaking her private communications to the press – information they seemingly have as result of seized phones and computers. Wanting still more private information for their investigation, the Delhi police have also made demands of several major tech companies. They have asked Zoom to disclose the list of attenders of a private activist meeting which they say relates to the toolkit; police have made several requests to Google for information about how the toolkit was posted and shared. And according to news reports, police have asked Instagram (owned by Facebook) and Twitter for toolkit-related information as well. It is unclear which companies have complied and to what extent. The police have touted Google’s cooperation publicly, but Google and Facebook did not respond to request for comment. Zoom and Twitter referred to their corporate policies, which state that they will comply with relevant national laws.Which may be why the Modi government has chosen this moment to introduce a new set of regulations that would give it levels of control over digital media so draconian they come close to China’s great firewall. On 24 February, the day after Ravi’s release from jail, Reuters reported on the Modi government’s planned “Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code”. The new rules will require media companies to take down content that affects “the sovereignty and integrity of India” within 36 hours of a government order – a definition so broad that it could easily include slights against yoga and chai. The new code also states that digital media companies must cooperate with government and police requests for information about their users within 72 hours. That includes requests to track down the originating source of “mischievous information” on platforms and perhaps even encrypted messaging apps.The new code is being introduced in the name of protecting India’s diverse society and blocking vulgar content. “A publisher shall take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context and exercise due caution and discretion when featuring the activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious group,” the draft rules state.In practice, however, the BJP has one of the most sophisticated troll armies on the planet, and its own politicians have been the most vociferous and aggressive promotors of hate speech directed at vulnerable minorities and critics of all kinds. To cite just one example of many, several BJP politicians actively participated in a misinformation campaign claiming that Muslims were deliberately spreading Covid-19 as part of a “Corona Jihad”. What a code like this would do is enshrine in law the double digital vulnerability experienced by Ravi and other activists: they would be unprotected from online mobs revved up by a Hindu nationalist state, and they would be unprotected from that same state when it sought to invade their digital privacy for any reason it chose.Apar Gupta, executive director of the digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation, expressed particular concern about parts of the new code that may allow government officials to track down the originators of messages on platforms like WhatsApp. This, he told the Associated Press, “undermines user rights and can lead to self-censorship if users fear that their conversations are no longer private”.Harsha Walia, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and author of Border and Rule: Global Migration, Capitalism and the Rise of Racist Nationalism, puts the dire situation in India like this: “The latest proposed regulations requiring social media companies to assist Indian law enforcement is yet another outrageous and undemocratic attempt by the fascist Hindutva Modi government to suppress dissent, solidify the surveillance state, and escalate state violence.”She told me that this latest move by the Modi government needs to be understood as part of much broader pattern of sophisticated information warfare waged by the Indian state. “Three weeks ago, the Indian government shut down the internet in parts of Delhi to suppress information about the farmers’ protest; social media accounts of journalists and activists at the farmers’ protest and in the Sikh diaspora were suspended; and big tech cooperated with Indian police in a number of baseless but chilling sedition cases. In the past four years, the Indian government has ordered more than 400 internet shutdowns, and the Indian occupation of Kashmir is marked by a prolonged communications siege.”The new code, which will impact all digital media, including streaming and news sites, is set to take effect within the next three months. A few digital media producers in India are pushing back. Siddharth Varadarajan, the founding editor of the Wire, tweeted last Thursday that the “lethal” new code is “aimed at killing the independence of India’s digital news media. This attempt to arm bureaucrats with the power to tell the media what can and can’t be published has no basis in law.”Do not expect portraits of courage from Silicon Valley, however. Many US tech executives regret early decisions, made under public and worker pressure, to refuse to cooperate with China’s apparatus of mass surveillance and censorship – an ethical choice, but one that cost companies like Google access to a staggeringly large, lucrative market. These companies appear unwilling to make the same kind of choice again. As the Wall Street Journal reported last August, “India has more Facebook and WhatsApp users than any other country, and Facebook has chosen it as the market in which to introduce payments, encryption and initiatives to tie its products together in new ways that [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg has said will occupy Facebook for the next decade.”For tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Zoom, India under Modi has heralded a harsh moment of truth. In North America and Europe, these companies are going to great lengths to show that they can be trusted to regulate hate speech and harmful conspiracies on their platforms while protecting the freedom to speak, debate, and disagree that is integral to any healthy society. But in India, where helping governments hunt and imprison peaceful activists and amplify hate appears to be the price of access to a huge and growing market, “all of those arguments have gone out the window,” one activist told me. And for a simple reason: “They are profiting from this harm.”  Republished with permission from the Intercept. Sign up for the Intercept’s newsletter here.

209,URGENT — 4 Actively Exploited 0-Day Flaws Found in Microsoft Exchange,Security,https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/urgent-4-actively-exploited-0-day-flaws.html,"Microsoft has released emergency patches to address four previously undisclosed security flaws in Exchange Server that it says are being actively exploited by a new Chinese state-sponsored threat actor with the goal of perpetrating data theft.Describing the attacks as ""limited and targeted,"" Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said the adversary used these vulnerabilities to access on-premises Exchange servers, in turn granting access to email accounts and paving the way for the installation of additional malware to facilitate long-term access to victim environments.The tech giant primarily attributed the campaign with high confidence to a threat actor it calls HAFNIUM, a state-sponsored hacker collective operating out of China, although it suspects other groups may also be involved.Discussing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the group for the first time, Microsoft paints HAFNIUM as a ""highly skilled and sophisticated actor"" that mainly singles out entities in the U.S. for exfiltrating sensitive information from an array of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks and NGOs.HAFNIUM is believed to orchestrate its attacks by leveraging leased virtual private servers in the U.S. in an attempt to cloak its malicious activity.The three-stage attack involves gaining access to an Exchange Server either with stolen passwords or by using previously undiscovered vulnerabilities, followed by deploying a web shell to control the compromised server remotely. The last link in the attack chain makes use of remote access to plunder mailboxes from an organization's network and export the collected data to file sharing sites like MEGA.To achieve this, as many as four zero-day vulnerabilities discovered by researchers from Volexity and Dubex are used as part of the attack chain —Although the vulnerabilities impact Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, Microsoft said it's updating Exchange Server 2010 for ""Defense in Depth"" purposes.Furthermore, since the initial attack requires an untrusted connection to Exchange server port 443, the company notes that organizations can mitigate the issue by restricting untrusted connections or by using a VPN to separate the Exchange server from external access.Microsoft, besides stressing that the exploits were not connected to the SolarWinds-related breaches, said it has briefed appropriate U.S. government agencies about the new wave of attacks. But the company didn't elaborate on how many organizations were targeted and whether the attacks were successful.Stating that the intrusion campaigns appeared to have started around January 6, 2021, Volexity cautioned it has detected active in-the-wild exploitation of multiple Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities used to steal email and compromise networks.""While the attackers appear to have initially flown largely under the radar by simply stealing emails, they recently pivoted to launching exploits to gain a foothold,"" Volexity researchers Josh Grunzweig, Matthew Meltzer, Sean Koessel, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster explained in a write-up.""From Volexity's perspective, this exploitation appears to involve multiple operators using a wide variety of tools and methods for dumping credentials, moving laterally, and further backdooring systems.""Aside from the patches, Microsoft Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst Kevin Beaumont has also created a nmap plugin that can be used to scan a network for potentially vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers.Given the severity of the flaws, it's no surprise that patches have been rolled out a week ahead of the company's Patch Tuesday schedule, which is typically reserved for the second Tuesday of each month. Customers using a vulnerable version of Exchange Server are recommended to install the updates immediately to thwart these attacks.""Even though we've worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems,"" Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Customer Security, Tom Burt, said. ""Promptly applying today's patches is the best protection against this attack.Sign up for cybersecurity newsletter and get latest news updates delivered straight to your inbox daily."

211,A major Chinese bitcoin mining hub is shutting down its cryptocurrency operations,Crypto,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/china-bitcoin-mining-hub-to-shut-down-cryptocurrency-projects.html,"GUANGZHOU, China — China's Inner Mongolia region plans to ban new cryptocurrency mining projects and shut down existing activity in a bid to cut down on energy-consumption.Bitcoin is based on a decentralized network, which means it's not issued by a single entity like a central bank. Transactions, recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, need to be ""verified"" by miners.These miners run purpose-built computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles that effectively allow a bitcoin transaction to happen. The miners receive bitcoin as a reward and that is the incentive.But because the computers are high-powered, they consume a lot of energy.Bitcoin mining consumes an estimated 128.84 terrawatt-hour per year of energy — more than entire countries such as Ukraine and Argentina, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a project of the University of Cambridge.China accounts for around 65% of all bitcoin mining globally — Inner Mongolia alone accounts for about 8%, due to its cheap energy. In comparison, the United States accounts for 7.2% of global bitcoin mining.Not all cryptocurrencies work like bitcoin, however.Inner Mongolia, located in northern China, failed to meet central government assessment targets regarding energy use in 2019 and was scolded by Beijing. In response, the region's development and reform commission laid out plans to reduce energy consumption.Part of those plans involve shutting down existing cryptocurrency mining projects by April 2021 and not approving any new ones. They also involve reassessing other energy-intensive industries like steel and coal.While the Chinese government has backed the development of bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology, it has looked to crack down on digital currencies themselves. In 2017, Beijing banned initial coin offerings, a way to issue digital tokens and raise money. The government has also cracked down on businesses involved in cryptocurrency operations, such as exchanges.China is also pushing to become more environmentally friendly. President Xi Jinping said last year that the country is targeting peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by the year 2060.Got a confidential news tip?

213,Boeing cites risks in design of newest Airbus jet,Transportation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-design-boeing/boeing-cites-risks-in-design-of-newest-airbus-jet-idUSKCN2AU2RJ,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Tim Hepher4 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co has raised concerns over the design of arch-rival Airbus’ newest narrow-body jet, the A321XLR, saying a novel type of fuel tank could pose fire risks.The U.S. plane giant’s intervention is not without precedent in a global system that regularly allows manufacturers to chime in whenever safety rules are being interpreted in a way that might affect the rest of the industry.But it comes at a pivotal moment as Boeing emerges from a two-year safety crisis over its competing 737 MAX, and Airbus faces its own crucial test of the tougher mood expected from regulators worldwide following the MAX’s 20-month grounding.In a submission to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Boeing said the architecture of a fuel tank intended to increase the A321XLR’s range “presents many potential hazards.”The debate surrounds the hot-selling A321XLR’s main marketing point - the longest range of any single-aisle jet.In most jets, fuel is carried in wings and central tanks.To meet demand for longer routes, Airbus has already added optional extra fuel tanks inside the cargo bay of some A321s.For the A321XLR, Airbus plans to eke out more space for fuel by moulding one tank directly into the fuselage, meaning its shape would follow the contours of the jet and carry more fuel.The concept caught the attention of EASA which in January said it would impose special conditions to keep passengers safe.“An integral fuselage fuel tank exposed to an external fire, if not adequately protected, may not provide enough time for thepassengers to safely evacuate the aircraft,” it said.In comments to EASA first reported by Flightglobal, Boeing cited risks if a jet veers off a runway or its wheels fail.“Public consultation is part-and-parcel of an aircraft development programme,” an Airbus spokesman said, adding any issues raised would be tackled together with regulators.Such technical exchanges rarely capture attention. But a battered aerospace industry is on edge after the MAX crisis, compounded by COVID-19, shook confidence in aviation.Commercial stakes are also high.One industry source familiar with the project warned any extended wrangle over certification could delay the A321XLR’s service entry from “late 2023” to 2024 or beyond.Should that happen, sources say Boeing is expected to encourage airlines to wait a few years longer for a potential all-new model that insiders say would leapfrog the A321XLR.While insisting they never compete on safety, Airbus and Boeing have a record of goading each other in the past over issues like novel flight computers on the Airbus A320 or European claims that four engines were safer than the 777’s two.Fuel tanks have provoked particularly sharp disagreement.In 2001, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration triggered changes to the design of fuel tanks worldwide, five years after a Boeing 747 exploded in mid-air.Investigators said TWA 800 was brought down by a fuel-tank explosion in the presence of unwanted oxygen, but Airbus officials maintained their own jets were less at risk.Reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Additional reporting by Eric M.

214,"Microsoft Launches Power Fx, A New Open Source Low-Code Language",Software,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/,"Microsoft today announced Power Fx, a new low-code language that takes its cues from Excel formulas. Power Fx will become the standard for writing logic customization across Microsoft’s own low-code Power Platform, but since the company is open-sourcing the language, Microsoft also hopes that others will implement it as well and that it will become the de facto standard for these kinds of use cases.Since Power Platform itself targets business users more so than professional developers, it feels like a smart move to leverage their existing knowledge of Excel and their familiarity with Excel formulas to get started.“We have this long history of programming languages and something really interesting happened over the last 15 years, which is programming languages became free, they became open source and they became community-driven,” Charles Lamanna, the CVP of Power Platform engineering at Microsoft, told me. He noted that even internal languages like C#, TypeScript or Google’s Go are good examples for this.“That’s been an ongoing trend. And what’s interesting is: that’s all for pro devs and coders. If we go back and look at the low-code/no-code space, there actually are programming languages, like the Excel programming language, or in every low-code/no-code platform has its own programming language. But those aren’t open, those aren’t portable, and those are community-driven,” Lamanna explained.Microsoft says the language was developed by a team led by Vijay Mital, Robin Abraham, Shon Katzenberger and Darryl Rubin. Beyond Excel, the team also took inspiration from tools and languages like Pascal, Mathematica and Miranda, a functional programming language developed in the 1980s.Microsoft plans to bring Power Fx to all of its low-code platforms, but given the focus on community, it’ll start making appearances in Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents and elsewhere soon.But the team clearly hopes that others will adopt it as well. Low-code developers will see it pop up in the formula bars of products like Power Apps Studio, but more sophisticated users will also be able to use it to go to Visual Studio Code and build more complex applications with it.As the team noted, it focused on not just making the language Excel-like but also having it behave like Excel — or like a REPL, for you high-code programmers out there. That means formulas are declarative and instantly recalculate as developers update their code.Most low-code/no-code tools these days offer an escape hatch to allow users to either extend their apps with more sophisticated code or have their tool export the entire code base. Because at the end of the day, you can only take these tools so far. By default, they are built to support a wide range of scenarios, but since every company has its own way of doing things, they can’t cover every use case.“We imagine that probably the majority of developers — and I say ‘developers’ as business users to coders that use Power Platform — will ultimately drop into writing these formulas in some form. The idea is that on that first day that you get started with Power Platform, we’re not going to write any formulas, right? […] It’s a macro recorder, it’s templates. Same thing for Power Apps: it’s pure visual, drag and drop, you don’t write a single formula. But what’s great about Power Platform, in week number two, when you’re using this thing, you learn a little bit more sophistication. You start to use a little bit more of the advanced capabilities. And before you know it, you actually have professionals who are Power Platform or low-code developers because they’re able to go down that spectrum of capability.”Early Stage is the premiere ‘how-to’ event for startup entrepreneurs and investors. You’ll hear firsthand how some of the most successful founders and VCs build their businesses, raise money and manage their portfolios. We’ll cover every aspect of company-building: Fundraising, recruiting, sales, legal, PR, marketing and brand building.

The First 5000 Days will be auctioned at Christie's starting this weekIt started with CryptoKitties. In December 2017, the dopey-looking cartoon cats, created by Canadian company Dapper Labs, debuted as tradable collectibles, like Pokémon cards for the bitcoin era. Each image was associated with a unique string of digits – a cryptocurrency “non-fungible token” or NFT – that could be traded on the Ethereum blockchain platform as a title deed granting the holder ownership of a particular kitty. The trading game quickly caught on among the crypto-initiated, so much so that CryptoKitties-related transactions clogged and slowed down Ethereum. That was eventually solved – and that was, for most people, the last they heard of CryptoKitties. But the process the goggle-eyed cats set off did not end there. Its end point is an auction starting tomorrow, in which a token associated with a digital collage of 5,000 images by graphic designer Beeple will go under the hammer at auction house Christie’s. Cryptocurrency payments are of course accepted. NFTs are selling like hotcakes, and this time the Ethereum network, which has been upgraded since 2017, is better equipped to deal with the endless sloshing. One recent report by NonFungible.com, a company releasing market insights on NFTs, says that, in 2020, NFT trading was worth over $250m, an increase by almost 300 per cent from the previous year. On online platforms such as Rarible, OpenSea, and Nifty Gateway (backed by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss) people are shelling out big sums of cryptocurrency and legal tender to buy tokens representing ownership of digital objects, which are then often re-auctioned at higher prices. Some of these NFTs are stand-ins for collectibles in the tradition of CryptoKitties – like Non-Fungible Pepes, a postmodern bid to reclaim the meme frog from the alt-right; others are objects intended to be used in video games; but more and more they are linked to pieces of digital art designed by honest-to-god creators such as Beeple – who, two months ago, sold a token for $777,777 on Nifty Gateway. If all of this sounds bizarre, that’s because it is. The idea of paying for the symbolic ownership of a digital image that lives somewhere on the web and can be captured on a screenshot or right-click-download within seconds, is so alien it seems either idiotic or ironic. Yet NFT proponents purport to be solving exactly that problem: the near-impossibility of monetising digital artworks. “As a mechanism, NFTs make it possible to assign value to digital art, which opens the door to a sea of possibility for a medium that is unbridled by physical limitations,” says Noah Davis, a specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s.

Currencies and cryptocurrencies (like the US dollar or bitcoin) are by nature made up of fungible, namely perfectly swappable, units: my two bitcoins are worth the same as your two bitcoins, and if we exchanged them neither of us would feel stiffed. Currency and cryptocurrency units are also, usually, fractionable into smaller units – dollars can be broken down to cents, bitcoins to particles called satoshis – which can be spent separately. On the contrary, NFTs – cryptocurrency assets developed according to special Ethereum standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155 – are unique and indivisible. Where a bitcoin is comparable to a dollar bill, an NFT can be likened to a cat, a sculpture, or a painting: you can’t sell part of it without spoiling the whole, and its value is rather subjective. Those characteristics render NFTs a good metaphor for art. Now, the crypterati and a waxing portion of the art world are asking us to take a leap of faith and believe that by buying an NFT we should feel like the owners of whatever artwork an artist has decided to link with it. This cannot credibly apply to physical artworks: if you are after a Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture, you will likely not be happy with a cryptocurrency token. But when it comes to intangible digital art, NFTs might just do the trick. Sure, everyone can download Beeple’s images from his Instagram feed, but that is missing the point, says Vincent Harrison, a New York gallerist who counts the Winklevosses among his clients and is helping Nifty Gateway attract more established artists onto the platform. “Anyone can see pictures on the internet of the most expensive artworks; posters are sold in museums,” he says. “But it's the ownership that creates value. So with [NFTs], not only do you have ownership, you have ownership on the blockchain, you have ownership that is transparent for everyone to see.”NFT technology, Harrison says, provides a way to attach a price tag to digital art, tapping into that primal high-quality hoarding instinct – the quest for status-affording Veblen goods, coveted only insofar as they are pricey – that is behind many collectors’ urge. Mix that with a frothy community eager to trade and meme any new shiny blockchain-adjacent construct to considerable prices and the trick is done. “In this digital world, we have accelerators: suddenly you could get three or four times what you paid for something – tomorrow there is someone ready to buy it,” Harrison says. Even better, blockchains are also able to keep track in a secure, immutable way, of how a token originated and changed hands over time. “Provenance is obviously an important part of the value of art,” Harrison says.

The crowd buying NFT-linked art is varied. Some of its members are cryptocurrency magnates looking for the newest thing to plunge their savings into. “People who were early in crypto and have a bunch of ether [Ethereum’s cryptocurrency], they're looking for ways to use it,” says James Beck, director of communications and content at ConsenSys, a blockchain company that has built an app to store and manage NFTs. They want to show, Beck says, that they are “patron[s] of the art on the internet’.” It helps that some NFT marketplaces allow people to showcase their purchases like in an online gallery or museum. Jamie Burke, founder and CEO of blockchain investment firm Outlier Ventures, and an NFT enthusiast, is one of those keen about their newfound role as digital arts supporters. Burke says that he was initially turned off by the early, “self-referential” cryptocurrency-focused artworks – strewn with Bitcoin signs and pixelated memes. But when he got more interested in the space, in summer 2020, he was “blown away” by the new artists. “This was art in and of its own right that I would buy, and I liked the idea that I could have a unique digital edition of it,” he says. “I just started collecting, personally, and trying to get new artists and professionals who are coming into the space. I'm building a bit of a collection.” That does not mean he turns down a good deal when it presents itself: on February 13, he sold an NFT he had paid $500 for, for $20,000 in ether. Announcing the sale in a tweet, Burke said he would use the return to buy more art. Harrison says that while the market right now is crawling with speculators who would buy and flip any blockchain-based asset in the hope that it increases in value, bona fide collectors are increasingly getting involved. “It's a combination of people that are just speculative and of people that want to collect and have something cool,” he says. “My role is to balance an element of speculation with enough people that want to buy something because they like it, and they want a hot collection habit. If everyone is buying to speculate, it doesn't work, then it just becomes another tradable token.”Some digital artists are welcoming of the trend. Most platforms are simple to use, allowing them to upload their works, automatically “mint” NFTs and wait for the offers to rain in – and these are often higher than the sums they would receive if they tried to sell their digital artworks online or as prints. Brendan Dawes, a UK graphic designer and artist who creates digital imagery using machine learning and algorithms, says that a print of one of his pieces would typically sell for $2,000, while his latest NFT sold for $37,000.

The profits don’t stop there. NFTs can be designed to pay their creators a cryptocurrency fee every time they change hands: if a buyer of one of Dawes’s pieces resells it, Dawes automatically receives ten per cent of the price paid. “That's again, one of the differences when compared to the traditional world: you get this ongoing, ongoing royalty.”Andrea Bonaceto, a venture capitalist and artist who is also creating NFT-backed artwork, thinks that the method might spur new forms of digital art blending digital imagery, music and technology. “You can create hybrids of art and music, or of art and literature and link both of them to a token. You can use smart contracts [self-executing routines that can be programmed onto a blockchain], so that the artwork changes over time,” he says. “This totally opens up an artist’s creativity.” Crypto being crypto, NFTs are bound to produce excesses. Some of the prices paid can be beyond comprehension, the epitome being the purchase of a virtual racing car for $100,000; and the fact that some websites are offering cryptocurrency loans in exchange for NFT collaterals has all the signs of a mini-crash waiting to happen. At a more basic level, William O'Rorke, a partner at Paris-based law firm ORWL Avocats, says that while the structure of NFTs – modelled after artwork rather than currencies or shares – means they are not subjected to the kind of financial regulation other kinds of cryptoassets have to abide by, they still risk falling foul of intellectual property law (for instance, if selling someone else’s artwork as one’s own) and consumer law protection.

Online auctions are also another quagmire, O’Rorke says, as sellers could potentially leverage fake accounts to tamper with the bidding process. “If you have ten accounts, you can artificially increase the price of NFT,” he says. “This kind of practice exists actually also on eBay, on all these kinds of services. But when people participate in the auction with anonymous cryptocurrency, for instance, it's much much more complicated to find out.” Luckily, he says, there are techniques and methods to detect coordination that could stave off the worst. In general, O’Rorke sees NFT art as a “spectacular” trend, but at the end of the day, smaller than other sectors in which NFTs are likely to take hold – from gaming, to football trading cards – as more and more brands, including toy manufacturer Superplastic and Nike get acquainted with the technology.The big question is, then whether this is just another cryptocurrency fad, or whether NFT art is here for good. Harrison has no doubt that what has been happening is just the beginning of a long-awaited transition, partly triggered by the pandemic-induced closures of museums and galleries. “There's something real here: this is just an acceleration of a cultural shift,” he says. Federica Beretta, gallery director at London-based Opera Gallery, says that while the pandemic, and a push for sustainability, made turning to digital artwork and digital auctions a “no brainer”, physical art will probably keep an edge in the long run. “The digital world offers extraordinary opportunities to artists, collectors, museums and galleries and it could also be seen as a fantastic complement to traditional art,” she says. “I do not believe art will become only digital in the future.”Gian Volpicelli is a senior editor at WIRED.

A new version of Ryuk ransomware is equipped with an additional worm-like capability to spread itself around infected networks, potentially making it even more dangerous than it was before. Ryuk is one of the most prolific forms of ransomware, with its cyber-criminal operators thought to have made over $150 million in Bitcoin ransom payments from victim organisations around the world. Like other forms of ransomware, Ryuk encrypts a network, rendering systems useless and the cyber criminals behind the attack demand a payment in exchange for the decryption key. This demand can stretch into millions of dollars.  SEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic) Ryuk has become one of the one most successful families of ransomware – and it's regularly updated in order to maintain its effectiveness. Now France's national cybersecurity agency – Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information (ANSSI), translated into English as National Agency for the Security of Information Systems – has detailed how the latest version of Ryuk is able to self-replicate itself over a local network. The ransomware can propagate itself across the network using Wake-on-LAN, a feature that enables Windows computers to be turned on remotely by another machine on the same network. By spreading to every reachable machine on the network, the Ryuk attack can be much more damaging. This capability was discovered while ANSSI was responding to an unidentified Ryuk ransomware incident earlier this year. The ANSSI paper warms that Ryuk remains particularly active and that ""at least one of its operators attacked hospitals during a pandemic"".   Hospitals appear to have been a particular target for Ryuk ransomware attacks, despite the – or perhaps because of – the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with access to networks vital for patient care. And given the ongoing situation, some hospitals are giving in to ransom demands, perceiving that approach to be the simplest way to keep treating patients – although even paying the ransom doesn't guarantee a smooth restoration off the network. Ryuk is commonly delivered to victims as the final stage of multi-stage attacks, with networks initially compromised with Trickbot, Emotet or BazarLoader – often by phishing attacks. Those compromised networks are then passed on or leased out to the Ryuk gang in order to infect them with ransomware. SEE: Phishing: These are the most common techniques used to attack your PC Often, the initial compromise of networks to install malware takes of advantage of organisations not applying patches against known vulnerabilities.   Therefore, one of the key things an organisation can do to help protect itself against cyberattacks is to ensure the latest security updates are applied across the network as soon as possible after release, particularly when it comes to critical vulnerabilities. Organisations should also regularly backup the network – and store those backups offline – so that in the event of falling victim to a ransomware attack, the network can be recovered without giving into the demands of cyber criminals.

								@filipeespositoTwitter has been implementing several features against misinformation and fake news, which includes a new alert introduced during the US elections for users who try to like or share a misleading tweet. Now, the company has announced new labels for tweets with misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and also a new strike system to warn users who create such content.
According to Twitter, the labels will first be applied by a team that will determine whether a tweet violates the rules on COVID-19 content, which includes vaccines. Eventually, Twitter will use automated review to check these tweets through machine learning technology.If Twitter determines that a specific tweet has misinformation or fake news about COVID-19 vaccines, Twitter will display a label with useful links from health authorities with reliable information about the vaccines. Users will not be able to share tweets labeled as “misleading” on the social network.This tweet is misleading. Find out why health officials consider COVID-19 vaccines safe for most people.There are five different categories of misinformation about COVID-19 on Twitter, which are:The feature is now being rolled out for English-language content and will soon be expanded to other languages as well — but that’s not all. Twitter is also introducing a new strike system that will punish — or “educate,” as the company puts it — users who create and share misinformation content on the social network.After getting two strikes, the user’s account will be blocked for 12 hours. With three strikes, the account will be blocked for another 12 hours. Four strikes results in a seven-day lockout, while five strikes results in permanent suspension from Twitter. As pointed out by The Verge, Facebook has also been applying similar rules for its social networks.The new labels can be seen in the official Twitter apps and also on the Twitter website.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Today's Best Tech DealsPicked by PCWorld's EditorsTop Deals On Great ProductsPicked by Techconnect's EditorsThe days when you could overclock your Intel “K” or “KF” chip with impunity, while liquid nitrogen vapor wafted through the long tresses of your hair, are over. On Monday, Intel abruptly ended its optional overclocking warranty plan.The end of life for the Performance Tuning Protection Plan was initially covered by Zhiye Lui of Tom’s Hardware. Intel said existing plans—which usually ran about three years—would be honored through their durations but as of Monday, March 1, you could not purchase a new plan.With liquid nitrogen and four 1200-watt power supplies, this team of overclocking experts set three new world benchmarking records during IDF 2013.The good news: If you happen to have your eye set on a $3,074.49 Xeon W-3175X CPU, Intel will throw in the overclocking protection plan (valued at about $35) for free. What a deal.The overclocking warranty typically cost about from $20 to $35 and has been around since the days of the Sandy Bridge CPUs in 2012. The concept was to give consumers worried about blowing up a CPU a backup plan—a replacement chip (limit of one)— should they push their original chip too far.Few true overclockers saw the utility of paying for the plan, because it’s always been a pretty gray area for Intel. After all, if you are paying a premium for the “K” version, which is unlocked and touted as overclocking-capable, that must mean the touted feature is covered if you use it, right? Pouring super-cooling liquid nitrogen over CPUs and GPUs lets them reach higher clock speeds. Well, Intel’s never quite been comfortable with outright saying that a CPU marketed as overclockable would retain its warranty if you actually overclocked it, even with tools for overclocking available directly from Intel. This uneasy existence has worked for years under what’s largely been a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. That is, you didn’t say why your CPU died, and Intel didn’t ask (usually). Despite this fairly liberal approach, it’s possible too few people bought the warranty to make it worth Intel's while. Practical overclocking has actually gotten easier and less dangerous.Overclocking also pays far fewer dividends. The days when you could get a 50-percent overclock from an Intel Celeron 300A are but a distant 1990s memory, filed away in a shoebox with your Jewel and Usher CDs. Most everday overclockers seem content with a stable 10- to 15-percent boost. We’ve asked Intel to clarify why it's ending this program now and will update our story as more information comes in.One of founding fathers of hardcore tech reporting, Gordon has been covering PCs and components since 1998.PCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.Visit other IDG sites:Copyright © 2021 IDG Communications, Inc."

It seems increasingly likely that Apple is getting ready to phase out the Lightning port. Whether the iPhone 13 will rip off the Band-Aid in one go, or whether we're in for a protracted death (a prominent Apple watcher has recently softened on a previous claim it would happen this year), the writing is on the wall, and all signs point to the charging port's days being numbered. There are good reasons why Apple might want to do this -- less cost, more space inside the iPhone, one less thing to break or wear out -- but what does this mean for you, an iPhone user? Also: The M1 Mac write issue: What's going on with Apple's SSDs?It means e-waste. A lot of e-waste. A little over a year ago, Apple claimed that being forced by the European Commission to switch from Lightning to USB-C would create an ""unprecedented amount of electronic waste"" and disrupt ""hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers.""Well, what's changed? I've spoken to a number of people in the industry -- from people who work on the front line of Apple support, to those who are involved in producing ""Made for iPhone"" gadgets and gear -- and it seems that while everyone is pretty much expecting the Lightning port to vanish over the next few years, no one could offer me any end-user benefit. I quizzed my contact within Apple support (who, for obvious, reasons wishing to remain anonymous) about Lightning port failure rate, and while it does seem to be a failure point (kids shoving things into it being the biggest problem, it seems), it is far, far outweighed by issues such as screen breakages, battery issues, and button failures. And, according to my contact, the Lightning port seems to be far more reliable than the USB-C ports on MacBooks, which seem to be quite a high failure point. Those in the accessory market see this as a move from Apple to tighten up the ecosystem, with whispers of wireless dongles and docks -- possibly modeled after MagSafe chargers -- that will attach to existing hardware already making the rounds.  All of this would generate revenue for Apple, both for any hardware Apple itself makes and sells, and licensing deals with other manufacturers. Now, Apple might argue that since iPhones have a long life, these accessories aren't going to end up being obsolete overnight. However, in my experience, while iPhones have a long lifespan, I don't see the same being true for accessories. And there are a lot of accessories out there. With an iPhone ecosystem now hovering around the billion devices, that means a lot of chargers, cables, and other random gadgets. And you have to remember that for some, as has been pointed out to me by worried readers, the car has become an iPhone accessory on wheels.

I've also heard concerns from people about not being able to put iPhones into recovery mode without a Lightning port, and that would mean taking a trip to the Apple Store. That's indeed another concern. On the flip side, however, it would make the iPhone much more resistant to jailbreaking or having the data accessed without the user's consent. Others have raised the very legitimate concerns about the inefficiencies of wireless charging compared to using a cable, and the negative effect it would have to have millions upon millions of iPhones having to rely solely on this method of charging.  Bottom line, no one can give me a reason for consumers to celebrate the end of the road for Lightning. If anything, even if the rollout is smooth, it will mean having to junk existing accessories, and then go out and buy more things. What are your thoughts on the end of the Lightning port? Has its time come, or do you still find it valuable? Let me know in the comments below.

221,Epic Games is buying Fall Guys creator Mediatonic,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309569/epic-games-fall-guys-mediatonic-acquisition-buying-announce-deal,"Filed under:Epic is acquiring Mediatonic parent company Tonic Games GroupFortnite creator Epic Games is acquiring video game studio Mediatonic, the maker of smash hit Fall Guys, for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced on Tuesday. The deal marks one of Epic’s higher-profile acquisitions of late, following its 2019 purchases of social video app Houseparty and Rocket League developer Psyonix. According to the blog posts and FAQs detailing the announcement, Fall Guys will remain available on Steam for the time being, and the developer is still bringing the game to both the Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms. Epic and Mediatonic say there are no plans right now to make the game (which currently costs $19.99) free-to-play, as Epic did with Rocket League. Epic later confirmed it plans to make the PC version of Fall Guys available on the Epic Game Store. Interestingly, Fall Guys is built using the Unity game engine, a rival to Epic’s Unreal platform. Despite that, the companies say they hope to bring Fortnite-style features like crossplay to Fall Guys in the future. The acquisition includes Mediatonic and Fortitude Games, both of which are owned by parent company Tonic Games Group, which announced the deal with Epic today. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the Metaverse and Tonic Games shares this goal. As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences,” said Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a statement. HUGE NEWS!@Mediatonic are pleased to announce that we've joined the @EpicGames family!What does this mean? I'm glad you asked!FAQ:https://t.co/QpiEHemUca pic.twitter.com/ZcGaoooljz“At Tonic Games Group we often say that ‘everyone deserves a game that feels like it was made for them.’ With Epic, we feel like we have found a home that was made for us. They share our mission to build and support games that have a positive impact, empower others and stand the test of time and we couldn’t be more excited to be joining forces with their team,” said Dave Bailey, CEO and co-founder of Tonic Games Group, in a statement. Officially called Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, the platformer battle royale game released last August as a timed console exclusive for the PlayStation 4 and also on PC. It became a fast hit and, like the indie sensation Among Us, an instant part of the gaming zeitgeist for the ways it let friends craving social experiences during the pandemic team up and compete against both one another and lobbies full of strangers while they were stuck at home. Fall Guys draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi’s Castle and Wipeout by making players compete in ludicrous mini-games that often result in slapstick failure for large swaths of the participants until only one player is left standing. Since the game’s release, Mediatonic has followed closely in Fortnite’s footsteps by releasing seasonal themed battle passes and also cutting deals with brands to bring trademarked designs and characters into the game as optional character skins, a business model Epic is quite familiar with and likely plans to continue.

222,Schools Are Abandoning Invasive Proctoring Software After Student Backlash,Privacy,https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9ag4/schools-are-abandoning-invasive-proctoring-software-after-student-backlash,"Aloha Sargent had been aware of the exam surveillance company Proctorio for years. It was a frequent presence at the Online Teaching Conference (OTC), the premiere event for remote learning educators in California. Many of the state’s community colleges, including Cabrillo College, where Sargent is the co-director of the library, had also begun using the tool to proctor tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.But this year, when she received an email from OTC organizers in early February that listed Proctorio as a diamond sponsor of the conference, she was shocked. The conference is put on in part by the California Community College system and several of the member schools, including Cabrillo College, decided not to renew their Proctorio software license in December. The decision came amid a nationwide barrage of complaints from students arguing that the software—which surveils test takers through their computer cameras and microphones, then uses artificial intelligence to measure their “abnormalities”—is discriminatory and a gross invasion of privacy.Like other exam monitoring software companies, Proctorio has celebrated the pandemic-induced boom in its business. It struck lucrative new deals, proctored more than 20 million exams in 2020 (triple the number in 2019, the company told Motherboard), and now boasts serving more than 1,000 schools and organizations in 170 countries.But that success has also brought scrutiny, and there are signs that the company’s technology and treatment of critics have soured its reputation. Some of the people most likely to use Proctorio after the pandemic—online learning instructors—say the tool is harmful and not necessary to stop cheating. Schools and organizations, including some of its most prized customers, are also cutting ties and declining to renew contracts.The day after she received the email from OTC, Sargent stepped down from her position on the conference’s proposal review committee. Several days later, she and Maritez Apigo, an English professor at Contra Costa College, announced in Twitter threads that quickly went viral that they would be boycotting OTC due to its sponsorship deal with Proctorio. On Feb. 23, OTC announced that it had decided not to offer any sponsorships to exam proctoring companies as a result of the backlash.“We have to have these acts of refusal to use ed tech that harms students,” Sargent told Motherboard. “We had to refuse to participate in and support anything with Proctorio sponsorship. It’s racist, it’s ableist, it’s an invasion of privacy, it creates a culture of suspicion, and it harms students.”In an emailed statement to Motherboard, Proctorio said that it has “not been made aware of any examples from partner institutions of the Proctorio software perpetuating racial bias or hindering access to exams.”But multiple news outlets have documented students’ complaints about Proctorio, and since August, the Twitter account @Procteario has been retweeting students who say the software didn’t recognize them because of their skin tone, that it flagged them as cheating due to exam-related anxiety, and that they cried through exams because of the extra pressure imposed by Proctorio’s surveillance.Within days of Sargent’s and Apigo’s tweets, educators around the world began announcing their own boycotts. Lisa Marie Blaschke, a distance learning educator at the University of Oldenburg, withdrew from an invitation to deliver a keynote speech at a conference in Berlin. Matt Crosslin, a learning innovations researcher, announced he would not present at or attend the Online Learning Consortium’s Innovate conference due to its sponsorship deals with Proctorio and other proctoring companies. And Phillip Dawson, a professor at Deakin University in Australia, said he would no longer submit presentation proposals to a European academic integrity conference due to Proctorio’s treatment of one of its harshest critics. Educators pulling out of conferences may not be fatal blows to Proctorio’s business, but activism on campuses is now prompting colleges to drop the software.In January, the University of Illinois’ flagship campus announced that it was discontinuing Proctorio after the summer 2021 term, citing “significant accessibility concerns.” In its statement, Proctorio disagreed with the characterization that the university was discontinuing its license. Instead, the company said, Illinois had renewed its contract through September—the end of the summer 2021 term.Other customers are leaving more quietly—something the company has either accidentally failed to acknowledge or been purposefully misleading about.Up until February 23, Proctorio listed the logos of 16 universities and companies on its homepage under the title “Trusted by Top Organizations.”Two of those organizations, Amazon and Louisiana State University, told Motherboard they did not have institutional contracts with Proctorio. A third, Baylor University, publicly announced in August that it was dropping Proctorio in favor of a competitor. But Proctorio’s website continued to list Baylor as a customer. It also contained a purported testimonial, attributed to the university as a whole, stating: “I like Proctorio because I never have problems and I think that it is a very user friendly proctoring service.”Proctorio told Motherboard that Baylor University still uses its service, despite the university's earlier statement. Baylor University officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment.After Motherboard began inquiring with the organizations listed as Proctorio’s customers, the company removed the logos of Amazon, Baylor, Louisiana State University, Duke University, Texas Tech University, Kent State University, and the University of Washington. Proctorio told Motherboard that it regularly updates its websites with new customer logos, and that it “updated with new partners last week, well before we were contacted by Vice.” That claim is false. Motherboard took a screenshot of the website on February 22, the day we began contacting the institutions Proctorio claimed as customers, and the company did not remove the seven organizations from its homepage until February 24, the day Motherboard contacted Proctorio.Screenshots of the list of customers shown on Proctorio's website, before (LEFT) and after (RIGHT) the company was contacted by Motherboard.A spokesperson from Duke University told Motherboard that the school had never had a contract with Proctorio. In fact, the university had published an academic integrity guide explicitly criticizing proctoring software.“Proctoring services essentially bring strangers into students’ homes or dorm rooms—in places students may not be comfortable exposing,” the guide reads. “These violations of privacy perpetuate inequity through the use of surveillance technologies.”At Proctorio’s request, an official from Louisiana State University-Shreveport emailed Motherboard to clarify that it was the school that had a contract with Proctorio. The Shreveport campus has about 8,500 students, far less than the 31,500-student flagship campus, in Baton Rouge, that Proctorio appeared to be advertising.Victor Balta, a spokesperson for the University of Washington, told Motherboard that the school began a six-month contract with Proctorio in April, then received a no-cost, six-month extension, but it does not intend to renew that contract due to the low usage rates among professors.A Texas Tech spokesperson said the school is three years into a five-year contract with Proctorio and has not begun discussions to renew it. Kent State, through a spokesperson, said it also has an active Proctorio contract, but declined to answer further questions. Duke University declined to comment.A spokesperson for the University of Iowa, which is also listed as a “Top” customer on Proctorio’s website, told Vice that the school’s contract expires this summer and administrators have not yet decided whether to renew it.Proctorio is not the only exam surveillance company seeing customers leave. In January, the University of Southern California announced that it would no longer use Respondus Monitor. The school will continue to use other Respondus tools, however. Simon Fraser University said “a clear no to Examity” after trialing the software. And at schools like San Francisco State University and the University of Michigan-Dearborn, faculty and administrative bodies have resolved to never use the tools.The companies also face a range of other threats. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has asked the District of Columbia’s attorney general to investigate privacy concerns and the “unfair and deceptive” business practices of Proctorio, Respondus, Examity, ProctorU, and Honorlock. EPIC has also threatened to sue the companies if they don’t reform their business practices.A group of six senators has also demanded that Proctorio, ProctorU, and ExamSoft address “alarming equity, accessibility, and privacy issues.”And civil rights and privacy advocates, in partnership with parents, are targeting Proctorio’s recently announced partnership with McGraw-Hill, one of the country’s biggest educational textbook and software publishers. After sending McGraw-Hill an open letter opposing the deal with signatures from more than 2,000 parents, representatives from Fight for the Future and ParentsTogether spoke with the publisher in January to express their opposition.“They insisted in that call that the reason they were offering Proctorio was because of the overwhelming demand of faculty at universities,” Lia Holland, the campaigns and communications director for Fight for the Future, told Motherboard. McGraw-Hill is “aware of the questions that have been raised” but intends to continue its partnership with Proctorio, which is currently working with “reputable third parties” to investigate the concerns that have come to light, spokesperson Tyler Reed told Motherboard. Many educators who use McGraw-Hill find proctoring services like Proctorio “useful, if not essential,” he added.Proctorio said that in September it contracted BABL AI to audit its algorithms and the non-profit My Blind Spot to examine its accessibility issues. But algorithmic auditing is a relatively new industry, and critics have accused companies of cherry-picking from audit reports to support their public image.Apigo, from Contra Costa College, told Motherboard she’s been contacted in recent days by people from a number of other schools seeking advice on developing guidelines to restrict the use of proctoring software. “I think this semester, it’s starting to gain more momentum,” she said."

A senior manager at Amazon Web Services has filed suit against the company alleging race and gender discrimination, saying that she was underpaid, denied promotions, and sexually assaulted at the firm.Charlotte Newman, who is Black, began working at AWS in 2017 in a public policy role. Prior to joining Amazon, she served as a congressional advisor, including a senior role advising US Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ). From the start, she alleges, she was ""de-leveled""—hired at a position below the one for which she applied and for which she was qualified—and undercompensated as a result.Underpaying Black employees through de-leveling is routine at Amazon, the suit (PDF) alleges. ""When a company's top leaders traffic in stereotypes of Black employees and fail to condemn intimidation tactics, managers farther down the chain will take note of that modus operandi and behave accordingly,"" the filing reads.During the 2017-2019 time frame, no Black employees were hired at or promoted to the director level (""L8"") within Amazon's public policy division, the suit alleges. Neither were any Black employees hired at the next level down, L7, until December 2018. Newman had applied for an L7 position but was hired at L6; the suit alleges that she did the work of an L7 job for several years before receiving a promotion to that level in fall 2019.While working for Amazon, Newman alleges that she faced multiple instances of colleagues overtly engaging in racial stereotypes to discuss her or her work, describing her as ""just scary,"" ""too direct,"" or looking ""like a gorilla.""Management's ""dismissive attitude towards Black and female employees"" such as Newman created an environment in which a senior co-worker seemed to feel perfectly safe sexually harassing and assaulting Newman, the suit adds, outlining several instances in which the colleague touched her inappropriately or propositioned her.Newman in 2020 filed complaints within the company about her colleague's behavior, the suit alleges, before then filing an administrative complaint with the Washington, DC Office of Human Rights about her experiences with Amazon.Recent reporting would seem to back up Newman's claims about widespread issues within the company. Tech news site Recode last week published a deep dive about racial bias inside Amazon.More than a dozen current and former corporate employees for the tech behemoth told Recode that Black employees inside Amazon ""often face both direct and insidious bias that harms their careers and personal lives."" All of the Black employees who spoke with Recode said they or Black colleagues they knew were down-leveled at hiring. Recode also obtained internal documents which seemed to display signs of bias in performance reviews.""We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind and thoroughly investigate all claims and take appropriate action,"" Amazon said of the claims. ""We are currently investigating the new allegations included in this lawsuit.""Unfortunately, the claims against Amazon are far from unique. Nearly every major tech firm has faced allegations of race and/or gender discrimination from employees in recent years.A Black manager at Facebook filed a complaint with federal regulators in 2020, alleging a pattern of discrimination and bias against Black employees in ""evaluations, promotions, pay, and hiring practices."" At the time, just 1.5 percent of Facebook employees in technical jobs were Black.Former Pinterest COO Francoise Brougher sued the company in August, alleging that Pinterest, which targets an audience of mainly women, was in fact a rampantly sexist ""boys club"" at the executive level. Several Black women who had worked for Pinterest also spoke out in 2020 about discrimination they had faced at the company. Pinterest settled with Brougher for $22.5 million in December but still faces a separate shareholder suit over similar allegations.Google, too, has faced multiple rounds of discrimination allegations. Last month, the company agreed to a $3.8 million settlement with federal regulators to settle allegations it underpaid women software engineers and unfairly passed over women and Asian candidates for software engineering roles. A Black Google employee also sued the company in 2019, alleging the company used ""bait and switch tactics"" when it hired candidates from racial minorities by placing them in less desirable roles than the positions for which they interviewed.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Microsoft is urging customers to install emergency patches as soon as possible to protect against highly skilled hackers who are actively exploiting four zero-day vulnerabilities in Exchange Server.The software maker said hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government have been using the previously unknown exploits to hack on-premises Exchange Server software that is fully patched. So far, Hafnium, as Microsoft is calling the hackers, is the only group it has seen exploiting the vulnerabilities, but the company said that could change.“Even though we’ve worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems,” Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Customer Security & Trust Tom Burt wrote in a post published Tuesday afternoon. “Promptly applying today’s patches is the best protection against this attack.”Burt didn’t identify the targets other than to say they are businesses that use on-premises Exchange Server software. He said that Hafnium operates from China, primarily for the purpose of stealing data from US-based infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher-education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and nongovernmental organizations.The zero-days are present in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. The four vulnerabilities are:The attack, Burt said, included the following steps:As is usual for Hafnium, the group operated from leased virtual private servers in the US. Volexity, a security firm that privately reported the attacks to Microsoft, said the attacks appeared to start as early as January 6.“While the attackers appear to have initially flown largely under the radar by simply stealing emails, they recently pivoted to launching exploits to gain a foothold,” Volexity researchers Josh Grunzweig, Matthew Meltzer, Sean Koessel, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster wrote. “From Volexity’s perspective, this exploitation appears to involve multiple operators using a wide variety of tools and methods for dumping credentials, moving laterally, and further backdooring systems.”More details, including indicators of compromise, are available here and here.Besides Volexity, Microsoft also credited security firm Dubex with privately reporting different parts of the attack to Microsoft and assisting in an investigation that followed. Businesses using a vulnerable version of Exchange Server should apply the patches as soon as possible.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Over the weekend, word emerged that a hacker breached far-right social media website Gab and downloaded 70 gigabytes of data by exploiting a garden-variety security flaw known as an SQL injection. A quick review of Gab’s open source code shows that the critical vulnerability—or at least one very much like it—was introduced by the company’s chief technology officer.The commit shows a software developer using the name Fosco Marotto introducing precisely the type of rookie mistake that could lead to the kind of breach reported this weekend. Specifically, line 23 strips the code of “reject” and “filter,” which are API functions that implement a programming idiom that protects against SQL injection attacks.This idiom allows programmers to compose an SQL query in a safe way that “sanitizes” the inputs that website visitors enter into search boxes and other web fields to ensure that any malicious commands are stripped out before the text is passed to backend servers. In their place, the developer added a call to the Rails function that contains the “find_by_sql” method, which accepts unsanitized inputs directly in a query string. Rails is a widely used website development toolkit.“Sadly Rails documentation doesn't warn you about this pitfall, but if you know anything at all about using SQL databases in web applications, you'd have heard of SQL injection, and it's not hard to come across warnings that find_by_sql method is not safe,” Dmitry Borodaenko, a former production engineer at Facebook who brought the commit to my attention wrote in an email. “It is not 100% confirmed that this is the vulnerability that was used in the Gab data breach, but it definitely could have been, and this code change is reverted in the most recent commit that was present in their GitLab repository before they took it offline.”Ironically, Fosco in 2012 warned fellow programmers to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Marotto didn’t respond to an email seeking comment for this post. Attempts to contact Gab directly didn't succeed.Besides the commit raising questions about Gab’s process for developing secure code, the social media site is also facing criticism for removing the commits from its website. Critics say the move violates terms of the Affero General Public License, which governs Gab’s reuse of Mastodon, an open source software package for hosting social networking platforms.Critics say the removal violates terms that require forked source code be directly linked from the site. The requirements are intended to provide transparency and to allow other open source developers to benefit from the work of their peers at Gab.Gab had long provided commits at https://code.gab.com/. Then, on Monday, the site suddenly removed all commits—including the ones that created and then fixed the critical SQL injection vulnerability. In their place, Gab provided source code in the form of a Zip archive file that was protected by the password “JesusChristIsKingTrumpWonTheElection” (minus the quotation marks).Representatives from the Mastodon project didn’t immediately respond to an email asking if they shared the critics’ concerns.Besides questions about secure coding and license compliance, the Gab git commits also appear to show company developers struggling to fix their vulnerable code. The image below shows someone using the username “developer” trying unsuccessfully to fully fix the code containing the SQL injection vulnerability.Thread participants respond by sarcastically pointing out the difficulty the developer seemed to be having.sorry, not telling where the SQLi still is, maybe you should call an exorcist to figure it out XDDDDDD pic.twitter.com/R4h0wNkoLgGab’s security breach and behind-the-scenes handling of code before and after the incident provide a case study for developers on how not to maintain the security and code transparency of a website. The lesson is all the more weighty given that the submission used the account of Gab’s CTO, who among all people should have known better.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

T-Mobile has cut at least 5,000 jobs since completing its acquisition of Sprint despite promising that the merged company would start creating new jobs ""from day one.""As noted by Light Reading today, a T-Mobile filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week said, ""As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 75,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative, and customer support functions."" That's 5,000 fewer than the number T-Mobile gave on previous occasions, including a press release on December 8, 2020 that said there are ""more than 80,000 employees at the post-merger T-Mobile."" The 80,000 figure was probably off by at least a few thousand employees by the time it was repeated in that press release, given that T-Mobile had 5,000 fewer employees just a few weeks later.The US government didn't impose any hiring requirements in the merger conditions that allowed T-Mobile to complete its acquisition of Sprint in April 2020. But T-Mobile and then-CEO John Legere made jobs a key part of their lobbying for the merger. In April 2019, Legere published a blog post titled ""Just the Facts on Jobs: The New T‑Mobile Will Create Jobs From Day One.""""New T-Mobile will have more than 11,000 additional employees on our payroll by 2024 compared to what the combined standalone companies would have,"" Legere wrote. Legere also claimed that T-Mobile would ""open 600 new stores to serve rural areas and small towns, that neither T-Mobile nor Sprint serve today, directly resulting in approximately 5,000 new retail jobs."" That was consistent with T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom's claim in April 2018 that its ""overall plan is for the larger company to employ more staff than the two previous companies put together.""The Communications Workers of America (CWA) union wasn't fooled by T-Mobile's premerger promises. ""We knew that T-Mobile couldn't be trusted to keep its promises. That's why we pushed for enforceable commitments from T-Mobile on jobs during the merger process,"" a CWA spokesperson told Ars today. ""Regulators need to take a close look at what's happening at T-Mobile and get serious about protecting jobs as part of their oversight of corporate mergers.""The CWA predicted before the merger was complete that it could lead to 25,500 job losses at retail stores and 4,500 job losses at T-Mobile headquarters. Retail stores are often run by independent third parties with their own employees, so those job losses wouldn't necessarily be reflected in T-Mobile's head count.The US did force T-Mobile to sell former Sprint subsidiary Boost Mobile and other prepaid businesses, which may have reduced T-Mobile's head count a bit. This does not explain the reduction from 80,000 to 75,000 jobs at T-Mobile because of the aforementioned retail-store issue and the fact that T-Mobile continued to cite the 80,000-employee number for over five months after it sold Boost to Dish.We asked T-Mobile today for details on what types of jobs were cut and will update this article if we get an answer.Before the merger, T-Mobile had about 53,000 part- and full-time employees at the end of 2019. Sprint had nearly 29,000 employees at the beginning of 2019, but it's not clear how many it had right before the merger was completed over a year later. T-Mobile also laid off some employees about a month before completing the Sprint acquisition.California regulators imposed a merger condition requiring T-Mobile to add 1,000 employees across the state. T-Mobile asked the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to eliminate the jobs requirement, but the CPUC denied the request.Update at 5:45pm ET: T-Mobile did not answer our specific questions about what types of jobs were cut but provided a statement after this article published, saying, ""We're not backing away from our commitment on jobs. In 2020 we worked through the integration and as with any merger we addressed some redundancies, however we have continued hiring in spite of a complex pandemic environment. We currently have nearly 3,000 job openings, only a portion of which are part of our Un-Carrier Job initiative that we launched last summer to hire 5,000 more employees.""You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

228,The dream of iPad mini Pro is revived by new rumors,Hardware,https://mashable.com/article/ipad-mini-rumors-2021/,"Apple's iPad family of products can be confusing, but it's easy to spot the odd one out: the iPad mini. The company's smallest iPad is updated fairly rarely (the iPad mini 4 was launched in 2015, followed up by the iPad mini 5 in 2019), and typically gets fairly cosmetic upgrades — its display size, for example, never changed from the original 7.9 inches. Now, a bunch of rumors point to an entirely new iPad mini this year, one which could inherit many characteristics of Apple's iPad Pro line of products. Korean blog Naver (via MacRumors) says an ""iPad mini Pro"" is coming in the second half of this year, with a 8.7-inch screen and a body that's a bit wider but also a bit shorter than the current iPad mini. This has been sort-of confirmed with the information released by Chinese leaker Kang, who says a smaller-sized iPad with a full screen is coming. Both reports claim the device is currently in ""design P2"" stage, meaning that it still needs to pass Apple's design and production validation tests before it can go into mass production. As sources go, those above don't have much of a track record. But the reports are in line with a May 2020 report by Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who said an iPad mini with a larger display could be coming in 2021. And Japanese blog Mac Otakara says an iPad mini with an 8.4-inch display is coming as early as this month — though this report claims the new iPad mini will retain a similar design as its predecessor, with slightly reduced bezels and a Touch ID Home Button beneath the display. SEE ALSO: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's pregnancy announcement was shot on an iPadAs an iPad mini aficionado, I've been waiting for something akin to an iPad mini Pro since forever. The iPad mini is, in my opinion, the perfect-sized iPad to carry around, as it fits into smaller bags and bigger pockets, and it's also the best-sized ebook reader among the iPads. With smaller bezels and a bigger display inside a similarly-sized body, it would be a massive improvement to the slightly outdated iPad mini. Even if we just get an updated iPad mini (without Pro design and features), it'd still be welcome, as the iPad mini is the only iPad that didn't get an update in 2020. "

PEOs use this platform to provide payroll, HR, and benefits services to their clients, commonly small and medium-sized businesses.PrismHR is a massive business services company servicing over 80,000 organizations with 2 million employees and total annual payrolls of over $80 billion.If you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.In numerous conversations with PEOs and their clients today, BleepingComputer has learned that PrismHR suffered a cyberattack on Sunday.For PEOs using PrismHR's platform, they are given a dedicated subdomain on prismhr.com that hosts their client portal. This attack has caused PEOs, and their clients, to lose access to PrismHR's customer portals, which are now displaying the following message:We're Working on Getting the System Back Online
The system you are attempting to access is currently unavailable. We're sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate your continued patience as we work to restore the system to operation as quickly as possible.Those PEOs who host the PrismHR software in their own cloud infrastructure are unaffected.In email templates provided by PrismHR, PEOs are telling clients that PrismHR ""is currently experiencing an interruption of service impacting over 200 PEOs across the United States.""The emails say that payroll will not be affected this week and that they are waiving administrative fees for the current payroll period due to the outage.While these emails do not indicate that an attack occurred, clients' phone conversations with PEOs paint a different picture than a simple outage.According to PEO employees and their clients, PrismHR has told them that they suffered a ""suspicious activity"" activity over the weekend and immediately shut down their servers and network to protect the ""integrity of their systems.""BleepingComputer was told that PrismHR is now restoring their systems from backups located on disaster recovery systems.PrismHR has told customers that their data was not stolen during the attack.When BleepingComputer contacted PrismHR with questions regarding this attack, they confirmed the attack occurred on February 28th, 2021. However, PrismHR would not share further details other than the statement below.""We recently experienced a cyber incident that affected our payroll and benefits software used by Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) throughout the US. We immediately disabled access to the system to protect customer information and engaged top-tier security experts to help on this. We are working quickly to restore customer access to our platform. While we are still looking into this, there is currently no evidence of unauthorized access or theft of data contained on our servers."" - PrismHRWhile PrismHR has not specified what kind of cyber incident was detected, from the details shared with BleepingComputer, this is likely a ransomware attack.Most enterprise-targeting ransomware attacks occur over the weekend while employees are not present, computers are not being used, and there is less attention paid to the network.This decrease in monitoring allows threat actors who have been lurking quietly on the network to begin the process of noisily deploying the ransomware to encrypt systems.Unfortunately, before encrypting devices, most ransomware gangs steal unencrypted data to be used in double-extortion attacks.If this turns out to be a ransomware attack, the nature of PrismHR's business could make this disastrous.Considering that the PrismHR handles the payroll, benefits, and human resources for thousands of organizations, they would also have very sensitive information stored in their systems.This data may include social security numbers, payroll, ID cards, employee benefit information, information for beneficiaries, and a wide assortment of other sensitive information.While PrismHR has told clients that there has not been a breach of data and that payroll is secure, we will not know for sure unless the ransomware gangs leak the data.Update 3/2/21: Added info that self-hosted PrismHR customers are unaffected.The Week in Ransomware - February 26th 2021 - Back from the HolidaysRansomware gang hacks Ecuador's largest private bank, Ministry of FinanceCyberpunk 2077 patch 1.2 delayed by CD Projekt ransomware attackFinnish IT services giant TietoEVRY discloses ransomware attackUnderwriters Laboratories (UL) certification giant hit by ransomwareNot a member yet?

230,Officials in Baltimore and St. Louis Put the Brakes on Persistent Surveillance Systems Spy Planes,Privacy,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/officials-baltimore-and-st-louis-put-brakes-persistent-surveillance-systems-spy,"Baltimore, MD and St. Louis, MO, have a lot in common. Both cities suffer from declining populations and high crime rates. In recent years, the predominantly Black population in each city has engaged in collective action opposing police violence. In recent weeks, officials in both cities voted unanimously to spare their respective residents from further invasions on their privacy and essential liberties by a panoptic aerial surveillance system designed to protect soldiers on the battlefield, not resident's rights and public safety.From April to October of 2020, Baltimore residents were subjected to a panopticon-like system of surveillance facilitated by a partnership between the Baltimore Police Department and a privately-funded Ohio company called Persistent Surveillance Systems (PSS). During that period, for at least 40 hours a week, PSS flew surveillance aircraft over 32 square miles of the city, enabling police to identify specific individuals from the images captured by the planes. Although no planes had flown as part of the collaboration since late October—and the program was scheduled to end later this year—the program had become troubling enough that on February 3, the City's spending board voted unanimously to terminate Baltimore's contract with Ohio-based Persistent Surveillance Systems.Given the program's problematic history and unimpressive efficacy, it may come as some surprise that on December 11, 2020, City of St. Louis Alderman Tom Oldenburg introduced legislation that would have forced the mayor, and comptroller, to enter into a contract with PSS closely replicating Baltimore's spy plane program. With lobbyists for the privately-funded Persistent Surveillance Systems program padding campaign coffers, Alderman Oldenburg's proposal was initially well received by the City's Board of Alders. However, as EFF and local advocates—including the ACLU of Missouri and Electronic Frontier Alliance member Privacy Watch STL—worked to educate lawmakers and their constituents about the bill’s unconstitutionality, that support began to waver. While the bill narrowly cleared a preliminary vote in late January, by Feb. 4 the Rules Committee voted unanimously to issue a ""Do Not Pass"" recommendation.A supermajority of the Board could vote to override the Committee's guidance when they meet for the last time this session on April 19. However, the bill's sponsor has acknowledged that outcome to be unlikely—while also suggesting he plans to introduce a similar bill next session. If the Board does approve the ordinance when they meet on April 19, it is doubtful that St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson would sign the bill after her successor has been chosen in the City's April 6 election.While municipal lawmakers are weighing in unanimously against the program, it may be the courts that make the final call. Last November, EFF along with the Brennan Center for Justice, Electronic Privacy Information Center, FreedomWorks, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the Rutherford Institute filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging Baltimore’s aerial surveillance program. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit initially upheld the program, but the full court has since withdrawn that decision and decided to rehear the case en banc. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 8. While the people of St. Louis and Baltimore are protected for now, we're hopeful that the court will find that the aerial surveillance program violates the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against warrantless dragnet surveillance, potentially shutting down  the program for good. San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has obtained emails that show that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) sent at least one request—and likely many more—for Amazon Ring camera video of last summer’s Black-led protests against police violence.

231,Hackers release a new jailbreak tool for almost every iPhone,Security,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/hackers-unc0ver-jailbreak-iphone/,"An iPhone hacking team has released a new jailbreak tool for almost every iPhone, including the most recent models, by using the same vulnerability that Apple last month said was under active attack by hackers.The Unc0ver team released its latest jailbreak this weekend, and says it works on iOS 11 (iPhone 5s and later) to iOS 14.3, which Apple released in December.Jailbreaking is a cat-and-mouse game between security researchers who want greater control and customizations over their phones, and Apple, which says it locks down iPhones for security. Hackers build jailbreak tools by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that can lift some of the restrictions that Apple puts in place, like installing apps outside of its app store, which most Android users are already used to.In a tweet, the jailbreak group said it used its “own exploit” for CVE-2021-1782, a kernel vulnerability that Apple said was one of three flaws that “may have been actively exploited” by hackers. By targeting the kernel, the hackers are able to get deep hooks into the underlying operating system.We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for #unc0ver to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability.— @Pwn20wnd (@Pwn20wnd) February 25, 2021Apple fixed the vulnerability in iOS 14.4, released last month, which also prevents the jailbreak from working on later versions. It was a rare admission that the iPhone was under active attack by hackers, but the company declined to say who the hackers were and who they were targeting. Apple also granted anonymity to the researcher who submitted the bug.The group’s last jailbreak, which supported iPhones running iOS 11 to iOS 13.5, was fixed in a matter of days last year. Apple works quickly to understand and fix the vulnerabilities found by jailbreak groups, since these same vulnerabilities can be exploited maliciously.Security experts generally advise iPhone users against jailbreaking because it makes the device more vulnerable to attacks. And while keeping your phone up to date may introduce security fixes that remove the jailbreak, it’s one of the best ways of keeping your device secure.Apple opens up — slightly — on Hong Kong’s national security lawEarly Stage is the premiere “how-to” event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

233,"Microsoft unveils Mesh, betting on mixed reality for gatherings and collaboration across platforms",Hardware,https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-unveils-mesh-betting-mixed-reality-gatherings-collaboration-across-platforms/,"by Todd Bishop on March 2, 2021 at 10:01 amMarch 2, 2021 at 10:09 amThe avatar will see you now.Or at least Microsoft hopes so. In a world still adjusting to the realities of remote work and life, the tech giant just doubled down on the concept with a new platform called Microsoft Mesh, representing its vision for how we’ll meet in the future.Announced at Microsoft’s virtual Ignite conference, Mesh promises to let people use headsets, computers and handheld devices to connect in virtual, 3D spaces, represented by both animated and photorealistic avatars.The company says Mesh will work via its HoloLens 2 headset, but also virtual reality headsets including the Oculus Quest 2, and mobile phones, tablets and computers using Mesh-enabled apps.Microsoft’s larger vision also puts it in direct competition with Facebook, the Oculus parent company, which has been pursuing its own plans for mixed reality gatherings and meetings.Mesh is built on Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform, and promises to follow the cloud model of handling much of the technical work in the platform itself. In a technical overview of Mesh, the company says the goal is to create a “platform for developers to design immersive multiuser MR apps without having to worry about complex technical problems.”Alex Kipman, the Microsoft technical fellow who oversees the company’s HoloLens mixed reality headset and platform, unveiled the Mesh technology during the keynote address at Microsoft Ignite virtual conference Tuesday morning. He appeared in a presentation hosted in Mesh via Altspace VR, the virtual reality platform that Microsoft acquired in 2017. Without going into detail, Kipman made it clear that Mesh will also be integrated with Microsoft Teams, the company’s digital hub for communication and collaboration.“Envision a Mesh-enabled Microsoft Teams, where colleagues from around the globe can collaborate as if they’re physically there,” Kipman said. “In a world of hybrid work, where ‘here’ can literally be anywhere and headquarters are no longer tied to a single physical location, Mesh will allow organizations to host mixed reality gatherings with everyone in the same room.”Business scenarios are the company’s traditional bread-and-butter, but Kipman’s presentation also previewed Mesh partnerships with Pokemon GO maker Niantic, filmmaker James Cameron and the deep sea exploration nonprofit OceanX, among others.The company released two apps to launch the new platform, the Mesh App for HoloLens, and a Mesh-enabled version of AltspaceVR.GeekWire members support independent journalism at a time when trusted storytelling and community engagement is more important than ever.

Bitcoin has won over some of America's best-known billionaires, and institutions worldwide are treating it as a serious financial asset. But bitcoin's rising price is only one part of the story.Whether they know it or not, people who buy bitcoin are strengthening a tool for protecting human rights. This still relatively new form of electronic money is censorship-resistant, seizure-resistant, borderless, permissionless, pseudonymous, programmable, and peer-to-peer.In bitcoin, transactions don't go through banks or financial intermediaries. They travel directly from one person to another.Payment processing is done not by a regulated company such as Visa or Mastercard but by a decentralized global software network. Storage is handled not by a bank but by the users themselves.Bitcoin issuance isn't determined by central bankers. The currency's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, set it to have an ultimate limit of 21 million. No one can ever print more.Bitcoin transactions can't be stopped, and you don't need to reveal your name or address or telephone number to participate. You just need internet access.In 2017, the economist Paul Krugman described bitcoin as ""some fancy technological thing that nobody really understands. There's been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions. There's no anchor for its value.""Krugman lives in a sheltered environment in a liberal democracy with constitutional protections. His native currency is globally dominant and relatively stable. It's easy for him to open a bank account, to use a mobile app to pay bills, or to grow his wealth by investing in real estate or stocks.But not everyone has that level of privilege. Around 4.2 billion people live under authoritarian regimes that use money as a tool for surveillance and state control. Their currency is often debased, and they are, for the most part, cut off from the international system that Krugman enjoys. For them, saving and transacting outside the government's purview isn't shady business. It's a way to preserve their freedoms.In China, if you type or utter one wrong word, the Communist Party might eliminate your financial services. This devastating outcome creates a chilling effect for dissidents and creative minds, who are forced to use the country's increasingly centralized digital economy.In Hong Kong or Russia, donors to human rights organizations can see their bank accounts suspended and funds seized.Over the past few months in Belarus and Nigeria, nationwide protests have broken out against tyranny and corruption. In both places, activists raising money to support the democracy movement have had their bank accounts frozen.Just a few days ago, in Burma's latest coup, the military shut down the banking system and turned off the ATMs.For activists living under state repression, bitcoin provides a way to preserve their money in cyberspace, locked away by encryption, safe from devaluation, in a network that has never been hacked. For them, it's digital cash and digital gold rolled into one.And in Cuba, Nigeria, China, Pakistan, Venezuela, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Palestine, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere, bitcoin is catching on and helping people escape tyranny and currency collapse.In the past few months, Belarusian activists have used bitcoin to defy the regime by sending more than 3 million dollars of unstoppable money directly to striking workers, who then convert it locally to rubles in peer-to-peer marketplaces to feed their families as they protest the country's dictatorship.In October, a feminist coalition in Nigeria raised the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin to buy gas masks and protest equipment as activist bank accounts were being turned on and off.In Russia, the opposition politician Alexei Navalny has raised millions in bitcoin as Vladimir Putin maintains strict control over the traditional financial system. Putin can do a lot of things, but he can't freeze a bitcoin account.In Iran and Palestine and Cuba, individuals face sanctions or embargoes because of the misdeeds of their corrupt rulers. Bitcoin gives them a lifeline for earning income or receiving remittances from abroad.Some Venezuelans, having watched their country's currency evaporate due to hyperinflation, are converting their resources to bitcoin's digital format and then escaping. With their savings secured by a password that can be stored on a flash drive, phone, or even memorized, they've started new lives in other countries, taking advantage of a technology that refugees throughout history could only dream about.The citizens of democracies also face financial controls, deplatforming, and an ever-expanding surveillance state. But those lucky enough to live in open societies can vote, sue, protest, and write, and those methods might allow them to protect their financial freedom and privacy. The billions who live under authoritarian governments don't have the same options.Unlike democracy, bitcoin is universally available. You don't need to have a particular passport or bank card or voting status to use it. No government can turn off your bitcoin if it's threatened by your ideas.We are in the middle of a great digital transformation, a time when cash, one of the last bastions of privacy and freedom, is disappearing. People rely increasingly on easily surveilled apps such as Apple Pay and AliPay—and, perhaps soon, central bank–issued digital currencies as their primary medium of exchange.Bitcoin provides an alternative to our increasingly centralized financial system. It gives any activist or journalist a way to raise funds without censorship, a way to save despite the corrosive impact of excessive money printing, and a way to teleport value without permission.Bitcoin wasn't as powerful five years ago, before it had global liquidity. But today, exchanges have popped up in every region, daily trading volume exceeds that of Apple and other popular stocks, and peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins have extended their reach, enabling users to sell bitcoin for local currency almost anywhere in the world.Maybe you don't need bitcoin. Maybe you don't understand bitcoin. Maybe PayPal, Venmo, or your bank account serves your needs just fine.But don't write off bitcoin as simply a vehicle for financial speculation. For millions of people around the world, it's an escape hatch from tyranny—nothing less than freedom money.Written and narrated by Alex Gladstein. Motion graphics by Lex Villena.

No ID? Maybe I’m doing it wrong, but the exchanges seem to have pretty good identity verification, and charge very steep fees for depositing or withdrawing anything.You misunderstand. There are no middlemen or exchange fees (just mining fees) as long as you’re using the network’s currency, which may or may not be honored everywhere. The fees are incurred when you leave the network and the security checks are there to make sure you aren’t doing anything malicious to the network. Once the network counts the world as its dominion, everything will be secure and exchange fees and tyranny will be entirely eliminated. It’s completely different from a fiat.I see, the charges are for converting dollars to bitcoin and back.Depending on the exchange, it’s not just bitcoindollars but other currencies, including crypto as well. Especially if the particular exchange doesn’t support the particular currency. Some exchanges are pretty good about the fees and some are good about hiding them (e.g. trade with any currency on the exchange for free but there’s a fee to withdraw whether in dollars or any other currency).I am making a good salary from home $1200-$2500/week , which is amazing, under a year back I was jobless in a horrible ytr economy.

But bitcoin’s rising price is only one part of the story.Be careful what you wish for.  The last time I looked, most of these best-known billionaires were working hand-in-hand with government regulators, trying to create a bitcoin trading system that was “acceptable” to regulators (the Federal Government) that would better guarantee that transactions could be monitored etc.Cameron Winklevoss on Crypto Regulation: “Free-for-Alls Don’t Work” The Winklevoss twins believe crypto regulation and customer freedom can meet in the middle.Known for their regulation-friendly outlook within the crypto industry, Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss hold a hybrid approach to privacy and government rules. The twin brothers explained in a May 22 podcast interview with Peter McCormack that crypto adoption comes a need for some degree of regulation. Cameron added:“The independence and sovereignty around crypto is unmatched with any technology before, but the onramps have to have an element of thoughtful regulation.”Zero regulation is not the answer Labeled as the 15th and 16th most influential people in the crypto space, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss dove into Bitcoin following their suit of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. The brothers founded the Gemini crypto exchange in 2015, which falls in line with regulations for New York-based exchanges. Agree. There is no chance – EVER – that any money-based billionaire is ever going to give a rat’s shit about human rights or freedom from oppressive govt control over the money system or anything else like that. The fact that this author is pimping bitcoin (uniquely – doesn’t even mention ‘blockchain’ as the underlying tech for an alternative money) just says that some bitcoin whales are looking to offload/diversify when the TA is favorable.I have been looking at every crisis that has popped up for the last 10 years. Just seeing whether or when some digital alternative will make inroads among those who desperately need those inroads to be made. It hasn’t happened. Hasn’t even started. But you can always be sure that the Bitcoin pimps will show up selling the value of hoarding hot air. They are like gold bugs in the sense that they never even really acknowledge an alternative similar to their own (eg silver – ethereum which has at least transformed into a different business model with far more talent available to maybe transform it into something that can actually become money).Can BLOCKCHAIN become a disruptive monetary technology? For those 4-5 billion folks who are locked out of existing money systems? Even though that group is also locked out of technology systems?I think yes. But Bitcoin can never be that. Bitcoin is the preferred blockchain currency for those who ski in Davos and then jet off to their seastead near Bimini – while they spend their days in their pajamas trading cryptocurrency based on technical analysis.At some point there will likely be a blockchain that is revolutionary money. If I were to guess – a money that is far more directly tied to usufructuary land registration/titling – and debt based on that. A money system that if it had been around in pre-Civil War US would have recognized the land titling claims of slaves working land not slaveowners with land grants from government sipping mint juleps on the verandah.It will NOT be Bitcoin. And if I were to guess – Bitcoin will do everything it can at that point to oppose any actual change to the status quo.With a due respect you are very wide of the mark. You don’t seem to understand blockchain and have been taken in by the people trying to sell blockchain snake oil as a product.  (B)itcoin is the network and (b)itcoin is the native token that miners collect in return for securing the network and ordering transactions into blocks. bitcoin isn’t the first truly digital currency, but it’s the first one that worked. Blockchain not Bitcoin is a debunked and misinformed narrative that has produced nothing of value and is technically wrong. Here’s an explainer of what blockchain actually is.. https://oleganza.com/all/what-is-blockchain/(B)itcoin is the network and (b)itcoin is the native token that miners collect in return for securing the network and ordering transactions into blocks.With due respect, you’re a dumbass who can’t read or understand what he wrote.He’s exactly right. Bitcoin miners have a vested interest in making sure Etherium, Litecoin, Compound, Algorand, etc., etc., etc. don’t devalue and debase their currency/efforts. The exact same way the FedGov has a vested interest and massive head start in making sure Bitcoin doesn’t (and likly won’t) do the same to the dollar.I think you are wide of the mark with respect to what a ‘currency’ is. Whether it is digital or not, it is only a currency if it is actually a currency – a circulating form of money. Those crisis situations are where a hitherto-unknown currency can arise. It’s been of interest to me ever since my first econ class with the hoary article about how cigarettes became a currency in WW2 POW camps. Whether its Greece, Zimbabwe, Iran, Hong Kong, Venezuela, 2008 US, etc – the same thing happens unplanned in most crises. Bitcoin certainly captured the imagination of ‘I want an alternative’ types in the aftermath of 2008 but has not become an actual currency because it never was one. Those who wanted an alternative then did not actually want an alternative to the dollar but to the stock market.I agree that blockchain has not delivered on much of anything. It is not securing anything of real value in a form that disintermediates existing intermediaries. That doesn’t mean Bitcoin is delivering on anything either. There is no reason at all to believe that the real value in tomorrow’s world depends entirely on flawed electricity generation to serve as the basis for future price discovery. It’s insane to believe that actually.But as I said – I expect that any future currency that disintermediates will of necessity be based on securing itself to a real asset that exists NOW but that is not currently secured by the existing intermediaries. The distributed database is exactly what secures that value in a crisis. Usufructuary land use/registration is exactly what exists now but is not included in any current banking/money system. Even though all of them are based almost entirely on securing land titling systems.Bitcoin has won over some of America’s best-known billionaires, and institutions worldwide are treating it as a serious financial asset.

And the US dollar as world reserve currency isn’t going to change any time soon. Bitcoin doesn’t need to effect, change or replace any of those things to have value because its primary role is an alternative form of custody for cash.Bitcoin is like a decentralized, central bank. This will become even more obvious when it moves past the volatile phase of its existence. It has all the same characteristics (custody, transfers, issuance and policy making). The big one is the custodial framework. Some folks push back on the issuance part, but it still holds up quite well. Some people claim BTC is getting a lift as a hedge against inflation. But inflation as currently calculated, or miscalculated, is nowhere in sight. Bitcoin rose to where it is now with almost no hype from anybody.

Millions of Texans lost power when the winter storm hit the state and knocked out coal, natural gas and nuclear plants that were unprepared for the freezing temperatures.The largest power cooperative in Texas filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, citing a massive bill from the state's electricity grid operator following last month's winter storm that left millions of residents without power for days.Brazos Electric Power Cooperative filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, according to court documents reviewed by NPR.The company in court documents says it received an essentially unpayable $1.8 billion bill from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the entity that maintains and operates much of the state's electricity grid.Brazos Electric is the wholesale energy provider for its 16-member cooperative.Ratepayers and politicians have criticized ERCOT's leadership for failing to prepare for the storm. In the immediate days after the record-cold temperatures, customers reported exorbitantly high electricity bills. The organization is under investigation by Texas counties and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Dozens of other energy providers face enormous charges for electricity and other fees during February's freak winter storm in Texas. Many others may also face bills that list billions of dollars in charges.The result of 'catastrophic failures'Brazos said in court documents that the company was in solid financial shape leading up to the late February cold storm. As February began, the idea the company would end the month preparing for bankruptcy was ""unfathomable.""""Yet that changed as a direct result of the catastrophic failures that accompanied the winter storm that blanketed the state of Texas on or about February 13, 2021 and maintained its grip of historically sub-freezing temperatures for days,"" the company said. ""Electric generation equipment and natural gas pipeline equipment have been reported to have frozen, causing the available generation within ERCOT to dramatically decline.""That storm, at its worst, left more than 4 million residents in the dark and bitter cold for days.The price for wholesale electricity was set at the maximum price of $9,000 per megawatt hour for more than four straight days. ERCOT also imposed other ancillary fees totaling more than $25,000 per megawatt hourBrazos said in its court filing, ""The consequences of these prices were devastating.""The company received invoices for the seven day winter storm event by ERCOT ""which, when combined, amounted to over $2.1 billion, payment of which was required within days,"" the court filings say.Brazos recovers its costs from its members, which collect from consumers. The company said in its filing that to protect itself, its member cooperatives, and consumers from a massive bill, it filed for bankruptcy.It said, ""Brazos Electric will not foist this catastrophic 'black swan' financial event onto its members and their consumers, and commenced this bankruptcy to maintain the stability and integrity of its entire electric cooperative system.""The company lists its assets and liabilities as between $1 billion and $10 billion.ERCOT didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"
236,NASA to Begin High-Voltage Testing on X-57 Maxwell All-Electric Aircraft,Transportation,https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-to-begin-high-voltage-testing-on-x-57-maxwell-all-electric-aircraft/,"

NASA Aeronautics researchers will use the Maxwell to demonstrate that electric propulsion can make planes quieter, more efficient and more environmentally friendly. Credit: NASA Langley/Advanced Concepts Lab, AMA, Inc.NASA is set to start high-voltage functional ground testing of the agency’s first all-electric X-plane, the X-57 Maxwell, which will perform flights to help develop certification standards for emerging electric aircraft. NASA is also supporting these new electric aircraft by developing quiet, efficient, reliable technology these vehicles will need in routine use.The testing will take place at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, marking a pivotal milestone for the project as NASA proceeds from the component design and prototype phase to operation of the vehicle as an integrated aircraft, taking a critical step closer toward taxi tests and first flight.The X-57, currently in its first configuration as an electric aircraft, called Mod 2, will use a battery support system for this phase of testing, drawing power from a large, high-voltage power supply as development on the X-plane’s battery control system nears completion.NASA’s all-electric X-57 Maxwell prepares for ground vibration testing, or GVT, at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California. Done in parallel with cruise motor controller testing, the GVT tested the vehicle at various vibration levels, helping engineers to examine and validate the integrity of the vehicle for flight conditions. A goal of X-57 is to help the Federal Aviation Administration set certification standards for emerging electric aircraft markets. Credit: NASA Photo / Lauren HughesTesting is expected to start with low power, checking the startup and shutdown sequences and verifying that the new motor control software boots up and controls the motors as expected. This software and other major components were recently redesigned based on lessons learned from previous testing by the project’s prime contractor, Empirical Systems Aerospace, or ESAero, of San Luis Obispo, California.These tests will include higher-power operation of the vehicle. The first pair of electric cruise motors to fly on the X-57, which were delivered by ESAero, will be powered up and activated, allowing engineers to ensure that the vehicle’s propellers spin as designed.This will be followed by throttling up the motors to make sure they provide all the power intended, validating the vehicle’s instrumentation system, and verifying whether all the sensors installed across the aircraft are functional.This artist’s concept image shows NASA’s first all-electric X-plane, the X-57 Maxwell, in its final configuration, flying in cruise mode over NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. In Mod IV test flights, X-57’s high-lift motors will deactivate during cruise mode, and their propeller blades will fold in to the nacelles to reduce drag. The motors will reactivate and use centrifugal force to spin the blades back out to provide necessary lift for landing. Credit: NASA Langley/Advanced Concepts Lab, AMA, IncThis high-voltage testing will feed directly into final verification and validation testing, a critical final step before taxi tests begin.“Many of the team members operating this test will be the same ones who will be sitting in the control room for flight, and that’s why I’m excited,” said Sean Clarke, NASA’s X-57 principal investigator. “We’ve turned a corner from system design and lab tests, to turning it over to the NASA flight systems and operations engineers to actually operate the vehicle. What they’re learning in this test, they’ll take with them into the control room for first flight.”

This means the C40’s range will be extended over time with software upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Henrik Green said.Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.Last month, Ford Motor Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.In November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, said its models would be all electric by 2030.Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, employment in the car industry is expected to shrink.Volvo CEO Samuelsson said that industry-wide, electrification will mostly affect engine plants and auto suppliers providing everything from oil filters to fuel injectors and spark plugs.“Those are a lot of jobs of course,” he said. “But overall I don’t think there will be a big difference.”Volvo said it will “radically reduce” the complexity of its model line-up and provide customers with transparent pricing.The carmaker’s global network of 2,400 traditional bricks-and-mortar dealers will remain open to service vehicles and to help customers make online orders.So far Volvo has not been affected by a pandemic-fueled global semiconductor chip shortage that has temporarily shut a number of assembly plants, which Samuelsson said was thanks to constant communication with suppliers.“So far, knock on wood, we have not had to stop any assembly line,” he said. “But it could happen any day.”Reporting By Nick Carey; editing by Barbara Lewis, Gerry Doyle and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

By downloading and archiving almost all of the data posted on Parler before it was booted off of Amazon Web Services, security researchers revealed the ugly side of a social network that appealed to people with extreme political views.Two months later, a similar thing is happening to a different digital refuge called Gab, which is where many of Parler's users migrated after Parler was shut down. According to Wired, a hacker embarked on a quest to expose Gab's patrons and was able to extract data out of backend databases using a SQL injection vulnerability.The resulting treasure trove spans more than 70 gigabytes of data on the platform's users and includes more than 40 million posts from the site. This represents public and private interactions between ~15,000 Gab users and is accompanied by records detailing user profiles, hashed passwords, and plain-text passwords for groups.There are no images or videos, but this is still an extensive data breach that reportedly includes the accounts of prominent personalities such as former President Donald Trump, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Infowars host Alex Jones. The company, however, denies that it suffered a data breach and assured Gab users that their passwords have not been revealed.Anti-secrecy activist group DDoSecrets has compiled the data into something it calls GabLeaks, with the intention of providing it to select journalists, social scientists, and researchers for further analysis. This prompted a response from Gab CEO Andrew Torba, who described the hacktivists as ""mentally ill"" demons. He also noted ""reporters, who write for a publication that has written many hit pieces on Gab in the past, are in direct contact with the hacker and are essentially assisting the hacker in his efforts to smear our business and hurt you, our users.""Whatever the case may be, the data will likely provide researchers with a good tool to study how disinformation campaigns, hate speech, and organized violence propagate from one platform to the next.TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, GamersTechSpot is a registered trademark.

18 January 2021
Ready for prime timeShanghai Tianshu Zhixin Semiconductor Co., Ltd., commonly known as Tianshu Zhixin, announced that its Big Island (BI) GPGPU has come to life. The BI is touted as China's first domestic GPGPU that's tailored towards AI and HPC applications and other industries, such as education, medicine, and security.The BI packs 24 billion transistors, and it's based on a home-made GPU architecture. The chip is built with the cutting-edge 7nm process node and 2.5D CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) packaging. Tianshu Zhixin doesn't explicitly reveal the foundry that's responsible for producing the BI. However, the description of the node coincides with one of TSMC's manufacturing processes.Tianshu Zhixin commmenced development on its BI chip in 2018. The company finalized the tapeout for BI back in May 2020 and should have already underwent mass production if Tianshu Zhixin wants to meets its goal of commercializing the chip this year.The BI solution reportedly provides twice the performance of existing mainstream products on the market, while also offering a very appealing performance-to-cost ratio. BI supports a plethora of floating point formats, including FP32, FP16, BF16, INT32, INT16, and INT8, just to mention a few. Tianshu Zhixin is keeping a tight lip on the BI's performance, but the company has teased FP16 performance up to 147 TFLOPS. For comparison, the Nvidia A100 and AMD Instinct MI100 deliver FP16 performance figures up to 77.97 TFLOPS and 184.6 TFLOPS, respectively. Note however that Nvidia's A100 also has Tensor cores that can do 312 FP16 TFLOPS (624 TFLOPS with sparsity).Get instant access to breaking news, in-depth reviews and helpful tips.Thank you for signing up to Tom's Hardware.

241,The COVID Zoom Boom Is Reshaping Sign Language - Deaf people are adapting signs to accommodate the limitations of video communication while working from home,Society,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-covid-zoom-boom-is-reshaping-sign-language1/,"Sign up for our free newsletters.Deaf people are adapting signs to accommodate the limitations of video communication while working from homePeople who use American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate are no strangers to video chatting. The technology—which has been around since 1927, when AT&T experimented with the first rudimentary videophones—allows deaf people to converse with signs over the airwaves. But after the coronavirus pandemic began confining people to their homes early last year, the use of platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet exploded. This increased reliance on videoconferencing has inevitably transformed the way deaf people communicate.One adaptation arises as a result of a video meeting’s limited frame size. “The signing space is expansive,” says Michael Skyer, a senior lecturer of deaf education at the Rochester Institute of Technology. “Even if many signs are produced easily or normally in the ‘Zoom screen’ dimensions, many are not.” The sign for “body,” for example, is usually produced by making a “B” hand shape and moving it from the shoulders to the hips. But to fit the reduced signing space demanded by videoconferencing, many signers have been ending it at the chest.Signs that take up a lot of space may be harder to convey on video, but so are small ones that involve finer details. Finger-spelled words, for example, as well as numbers and colors, all involve relatively small details formed with a single hand—which can make them harder to see clearly on a tiny conference screen. Skyer says signers must go slower and repeat themselves more often to fill in such gaps.Signers communicating through video must also consider how they angle their bodies so as to convey what they mean clearly. If two people face each other in an in-person interaction, each can easily see whether the other’s hands are moving toward them or away from them. This can be crucial for grammatical reasons; for example, signs representing future tense are usually made with a forward motion away from the signer’s body, whereas past tense signs move the opposite way. Such nuances can be difficult to detect on a video screen. Skyer is deaf and teaches in American Sign Language in a bilingual ASL-English environment, in which a teacher typically signs in ASL and also shares content in written English. When using videoconferencing in class, he says, he sometimes has to sign with his body turned to present himself in three-quarters view, so that signs normally seen head-on are easier to understand.Some signs require a shared space for their meanings to be clear. Ones that involve indicating or pointing at another person simply don’t work in a typical videoconferencing  “room,” where multiple speakers may appear in different arrangements on each participant’s screen. Julie Hochgesang, an associate professor of linguistics at Gallaudet University, says some deaf people using videoconferencing have begun making signs such as “ask” or “give”—which require indicating individuals—more explicit by adding a referent, a sign that clarifies the subject of a statement.*Will such changes fade after people return to in-person interactions? They might—but some experts say linguistic shifts are still inevitable. Because sign languages often involve and are inextricable from their physical environments, Skyer and Hochgesang both suggest people should not necessarily think of them as having defined identities. “Instead, I like to say there are ASL communities with varying practices and lexicons,” Hochgesang says. “Yes, undoubtedly, the long-term use of Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms (including FaceTime, videophones, etc.) will shape and constrain our language practices. But that’s true for anything in our lives.… Our tools, people we interact with and other aspects of our environment will always be a factor in our language and communicative practices.”Despite the limitations they place on American Sign Language, videoconferencing platforms can also be empowering for deaf people. The multimodal features of these tools—which enable both video and text chat—give his students multiple avenues for learning, Skyer says. Instead of being constrained to one way of communicating, they can now type in written English using the chat feature, sign in ASL using the video feature or do a combination of both—all from home.“ASL is defined by how it is used,” Skyer says. “How it is used is not static, and the Zoom changes show us this. Words, concepts and pragmatics [the use of language in social contexts] themselves evolve and shift given new mediums of expression.”*Editor’s Note (3/4/21): This sentence has been revised after posting to clarify Julie Hochgesang’s description of the strategy some deaf people have adopted in videoconferencing.March 13, 2020  —  Yoshiko Iwai |  OpinionAugust 26, 2010  —  John EischeidAugust 1, 2020  —  Sarah Dunphy-Lelii |  OpinionJune 8, 2020  —  Gary StixDiscover world-changing science.

242,U.S. oil industry lobby weighs support of carbon pricing: source,Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-carbon-api/u-s-oil-industry-lobby-weighs-support-of-carbon-pricing-source-idUSKBN2AU1QU?rpc=401&amp;,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Valerie Volcovici3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Petroleum Institute (API) is weighing endorsing a price on carbon emissions, a major shift after long resisting mandatory government climate policies, a source familiar with the decision making said.The API, the main U.S. oil industry lobby group that includes most of the world’s biggest oil companies, is considering carbon pricing “among other policy solutions to reduce emissions and reach the ambitions of the Paris Agreement,” the source said, confirming a report about the policy shift by the Wall Street Journal.The group is confronting its previous resistance to regulatory action on climate change amid a shift in industry strategy on the issue and the new U.S. presidency.European member Total quit the group because of disagreements over API’s climate policies and support for easing drilling regulations and the Biden administration is pursuing a policy agenda that would shift the United States from fossil fuels.A draft statement of the policy shift reviewed by the Wall Street Journal said the group does not endorse a specific carbon pricing tool such as a tax on carbon emissions or emissions trading scheme. The source said, however, that the group’s State of American Energy report released in January was supportive of a market-based carbon pricing policy.The API did not comment on whether or when the group would formally endorse a price on carbon but said it has been working for nearly a year on an industry-wide response to climate change.“Our efforts are focused on supporting a new U.S. contribution to the global Paris agreement,” said API spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren.Within API, there has been a widening rift between Europe’s top energy companies, which over the past year accelerated plans to cut emissions and build large renewable energy businesses, and their U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp that have resisted growing investor pressure to diversify.Other major industry groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, which includes Chevron, over the last year have endorsed market-based carbon pricing.Chevron said it has engaged those groups and API “to support well-designed carbon pricing.”“We support economy-wide carbon pricing as the primary policy tool to address climate change, applied across the broadest possible area to maximize environmental and economic efficiency and effectiveness,” Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said in an e-mailed statement.BP and Shell declined to comment.Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Christian SchmollingerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

243,How many hours of work pay the internet bill?,Networking/Telecom,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/internet-hours-expensive-bills-web-broadband-countries-comparison,"We use cookies to improve your experience on our website. By using our website you consent to all cookies in accordance with our updated Cookie Notice.A study by VPN provider Surfshark has found that the planet’s least affordable internet is also often its worst. According to the 2020 Digital Quality of Life Index, Nigerians would have to work more than 33 hours at average pay to be able to afford for the cheapest monthly broadband contract available in the country. This is despite the fact that Nigeria has the third worst broadband speed and fifth least reliable broadband in the survey that looked at 85 countries.Many countries in Latin America are plagued by the same problem. The Philippines are the least affordable in Asia, requiring more than seven hours of work at average pay for a month of broadband internet, despite poor overall quality.The Asian continent is also home to some cheap internet plans, however. A month of internet costs less than the average hourly wage in Japan, China and Nepal and just a little above it in Indonesia and Singapore. The latter is also home to the fastest broadband connection in the survey, which is also rated completely reliable.Very affordable and reliable internet connections can also be found in Canada, Israel and many countries in Europe. Several Eastern European nations and Iran offer great affordability and stability but lack some points in the speed department. Montenegro sticks out as the country with the least affordable internet in Europe, at a price equivalent of seven hours of work.While the high prices for poor service seem contradictory on the surface, the imbalance can be explained by poor infrastructure and lower internet penetration rates in some countries translating into a higher cost for a product that is not fully matured yet.World Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.

Adobe, Arm, Intel, and Microsoft have partnered with photo verification platform Truepic and the BBC to form the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).The coalition, open to further membership, is seeking to address the prevalence of disinformation, misinformation, and online content fraud through developing technical standards for certifying the source and history or provenance of media content.Member organisations will work together to develop content provenance specifications for common asset types and formats, they said in a statement, to enable publishers, creators, and consumers to trace the origin and evolution of a piece of media, including images, videos, audio, and documents. These technical specifications will include defining what information is associated with each type of asset, how that information is presented and stored, and how evidence of tampering can be identified.""There's a critical need to address widespread deception in online content -- now supercharged by advances in AI and graphics and diffused rapidly via the internet,"" Microsoft chief scientific officer Eric Horvitz said.""Our imperative as researchers and technologists is to create and refine technical and sociotechnical approaches to this grand challenge of our time. We're excited about methods for certifying the origin and provenance of online content.""Adobe general counsel Dana Rao said the C2PA would accelerate the critical work of rebuilding the public's trust in online content.The coalition said the C2PA's open standard will give platforms a method to preserve and read provenance-based digital content. ""Because an open standard can be adopted by any online platform, it is critical to scaling trust across the internet,"" the statement continued. ""In addition to the inclusion of varied media types at scale, C2PA is driving an end-to-end provenance experience from the capturing device to the information consumer. Collaboration with chipmakers, news organisations, and software and platform companies is critical to facilitate a comprehensive provenance standard and drive broad adoption across the content ecosystem.""The formation of the C2PA brings together founding members of the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the Microsoft and BBC-led Project Origin.With Australia's News Media Bargaining Code -- a piece of legislation directing Google and Facebook to pay to display local news content -- hours away from passage, Microsoft has called for a similar mandate to be introduced in Europe.Microsoft vice president Brad Smith earlier this month published a blog post that praised the Australian government for the code and said the US should take notice, even going as far as saying the code should be copied by the Biden Administration.On Tuesday, Microsoft rallied support from a handful of Europe's press publishers, having agreed to work together on a solution for how the former could be paid for the use of their content by ""gatekeepers that have dominant market power"".Microsoft said the outcome should be in line with the objectives of the new neighbouring right in the EU Digital Single Market Copyright Directive, which comes into force in June, and that it should take inspiration from the new Australian legislation.""Although press publishers have been granted a neighbouring right in the EU, negotiations with such gatekeepers will not produce fair outcomes unless additional regulatory measures are brought forward to address gatekeepers with dominant market power, through appropriate regulatory frameworks such as the Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, or other national laws,"" Microsoft wrote.""EMMA, ENPA, EPC, NME, and Microsoft therefore call for an arbitration mechanism to be implemented in European or national law requiring such gatekeepers to pay for press content in full respect of the Publisher's Right set out in Directive 2019/790.""Microsoft said it welcomes proposals made by several members of the European Parliament to introduce a final arbitration mechanism into relevant regulation. ""This is needed to prevent undermining the scope of the publishers' right and to create legal certainty. Otherwise, even though press publishers have a neighbouring right, they might not have the economic strength to negotiate fair and balanced agreements with these gatekeeper tech companies, who might otherwise threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,"" the tech giant said.

								@filipeespositoEven after North Dakota senators voted down a proposal that would allow developers to offer apps outside the App Store on iOS, other US states are considering similar legislation — including Arizona. It’s now known that Apple has been lobbying against this bill in Arizona before it’s even formally introduced.
As reported by Protocol (via MacRumors), Apple and Google have begun negotiating with Arizona representatives to avoid laws that would let developers bypass the App Store and Google Play in-app purchase systems.Apple tapped its own lobbyist, Rod Diridon, to begin lobbying in Arizona. It hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, to negotiate with Cobb on its behalf. It quickly joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, which began lobbying against the bill. And lawyers for both Google and Apple went straight to the Arizona House’s lawyers to argue that the bill is unconstitutional.The reason why both companies are against such legislation is because it could affect the sales of their online app stores. Apple and Google take a 15% to 30% commission from each app or in-app content sold, which has long been a matter of discussion among developers, companies, and even public organizations in multiple countries.If Apple is eventually forced to open up the iOS ecosystem so that anyone can publish apps outside of the App Store, the company would definitely lose much of its revenue from online services. Not to mention that if such legislation is passed in one state, other states in the US and even other countries would have precedents for passing similar bills.HB2005 could pass the House this week and potentially even make it through the Republican-majority Arizona Senate, making Arizona the first state to push through legislation to loosen Apple and Google’s grip over their app ecosystems in the country. There’s similar legislation being considered in Minnesota, Georgia, Hawaii and other states, mostly being pushed by Match Group, Epic Games and the broader Coalition for App Fairness, which only formed last year and includes Spotify, Tile and others.Apple has been under investigation following several accusations of monopolistic practices, as the company controls which apps are allowed on its devices and requires developers to pay a commission for each sale they make through the App Store. Such accusations became more frequent after Apple removed the popular game Fortnite from the App Store following an update that circumvented iOS’s in-app purchase system.Apple compliance chief Kyle Andeer said that the App Store commission helps the company sustain its ecosystem and provide tools for developers to create iOS apps. Ander also reinforced that most developers now pay only 15% commission to Apple.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

248,"Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language",Software,https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnljb21iaW5hdG9yLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA2knGIHpakt9zpbQ7-fxXccdr5MatHEN_lYSWLgL-FHzpR6bUbbQxVl466d5k8mZnR4irfd8sFAJpVShj0UmYFV7NRVXbZb9HXRTQndBo5vF-Aj9ZJdTmCRHZm9-sfheJRKIivyLr88O1ytp-9VnDjvRMaOmDHYb7AcZf3RwTVt,"Microsoft today announced Power Fx, a new low-code language that takes its cues from Excel formulas. Power Fx will become the standard for writing logic customization across Microsoft’s own low-code Power Platform, but since the company is open-sourcing the language, Microsoft also hopes that others will implement it as well and that it will become the de facto standard for these kinds of use cases.Since Power Platform itself targets business users more so than professional developers, it feels like a smart move to leverage their existing knowledge of Excel and their familiarity with Excel formulas to get started.“We have this long history of programming languages and something really interesting happened over the last 15 years, which is programming languages became free, they became open source and they became community-driven,” Charles Lamanna, the CVP of Power Platform engineering at Microsoft, told me. He noted that even internal languages like C#, TypeScript or Google’s Go are good examples for this.“That’s been an ongoing trend. And what’s interesting is: that’s all for pro devs and coders. If we go back and look at the low-code/no-code space, there actually are programming languages, like the Excel programming language, or in every low-code/no-code platform has its own programming language. But those aren’t open, those aren’t portable, and those are community-driven,” Lamanna explained.Microsoft says the language was developed by a team led by Vijay Mital, Robin Abraham, Shon Katzenberger and Darryl Rubin. Beyond Excel, the team also took inspiration from tools and languages like Pascal, Mathematica and Miranda, a functional programming language developed in the 1980s.Microsoft plans to bring Power Fx to all of its low-code platforms, but given the focus on community, it’ll start making appearances in Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents and elsewhere soon.But the team clearly hopes that others will adopt it as well. Low-code developers will see it pop up in the formula bars of products like Power Apps Studio, but more sophisticated users will also be able to use it to go to Visual Studio Code and build more complex applications with it.As the team noted, it focused on not just making the language Excel-like but also having it behave like Excel — or like a REPL, for you high-code programmers out there. That means formulas are declarative and instantly recalculate as developers update their code.Most low-code/no-code tools these days offer an escape hatch to allow users to either extend their apps with more sophisticated code or have their tool export the entire code base. Because at the end of the day, you can only take these tools so far. By default, they are built to support a wide range of scenarios, but since every company has its own way of doing things, they can’t cover every use case.“We imagine that probably the majority of developers — and I say ‘developers’ as business users to coders that use Power Platform — will ultimately drop into writing these formulas in some form. The idea is that on that first day that you get started with Power Platform, we’re not going to write any formulas, right? […] It’s a macro recorder, it’s templates. Same thing for Power Apps: it’s pure visual, drag and drop, you don’t write a single formula. But what’s great about Power Platform, in week number two, when you’re using this thing, you learn a little bit more sophistication. You start to use a little bit more of the advanced capabilities. And before you know it, you actually have professionals who are Power Platform or low-code developers because they’re able to go down that spectrum of capability.”Early Stage is the premiere ‘how-to’ event for startup entrepreneurs and investors. You’ll hear firsthand how some of the most successful founders and VCs build their businesses, raise money and manage their portfolios.

In AI-generated animations, faces that were once frozen in time blink, turn their heads and even smile.Artificial intelligence (AI) can now transform photos of people into short, highly realistic animations, much like the moving pictures in the newspapers and posters of Harry Potter's magical world. In these AI-animated clips, faces that were once frozen in time blink, turn their heads and even smile, their movements wavering between astonishingly lifelike and deeply unsettling (and yes, downright creepy). Genealogy website MyHeritage introduced the animation engine on Feb. 25. Developed by technology company D-ID and known as Deep Nostalgia, it enables users to animate photos via the MyHeritage website, representatives said in a blog post. D-ID designed custom algorithms that recreate the naturalistic movement of human faces digitally, applying those subtle movements to photographs and modifying facial expressions that move as human faces normally do, according to the D-ID website. Related: Can machines be creative? Meet 9 AI 'artists'When AIs create original video footage, often referred to as ""deepfake,"" they do so using a method called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. This technique pits two AIs against each other; one produces content and the other evaluates how well that content emulates the real thing. Over time, the algorithms drive each other to become better, until the original AI content is very hard to identify as fake.Such videos can be used in troubling ways: from showing political figures making fake speeches, to adding the faces of famous actresses to the bodies of actresses in pornographic movies, Vice reported in 2018.However, video clips generated by Deep Nostalgia are just a few seconds long, and the training footage for the AI did not include speech, so as to prevent the creation of deepfakes, according to MyHeritage.– 5 intriguing uses for artificial intelligence (that aren't killer robots)– Artificial intelligence: Friendly or frightening?– Intelligent machines to space colonies: 5 sci-fi visions of the futureProgrammers trained Deep Nostalgia's GAN with sets of ""blueprint videos,"" each representing different combinations of movements for eyes, mouths, eyebrows, cheeks and heads; the AI then learned how these could be applied to photos of different people to achieve an illusion of realistic motion. It assigns different suites of facial gestures to different photos, depending on their subjects' postures and orientations, according to MyHeritage.Results in the animations can vary, depending on the quality of the original image and how the person in the photo posed. The illusion tends to be most effective when the subject is facing the camera, and the end result can be less convincing when the algorithm has to create digital information to represent something that was missing in the original picture, ""such as teeth or ears,"" MyHeritage representatives said. Deep Nostalgia may also struggle to realistically incorporate accessories such as hats or glasses, which can obscure parts of the face and head. In those cases, ""sometimes the simulated movement works well — and other times it does not,"" according to the site. While MyHeritage encouraged users to test Deep Nostalgia with family photos, Twitter users shared examples of some famous faces from the past, such as the poet Emily Dickinson; chemist and X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin; and abolitionist Frederick Douglass.Frederick Douglass, the mighty abolitionist, was the single most photographed person in the United States during the nineteenth century.

251,Boeing to base U.S. Air Force prototype on Australian pilotless combat jet,Robotics/Automation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-defense-unmanned/boeing-to-base-u-s-air-force-prototype-on-australian-pilotless-combat-jet-idUSKCN2AU060,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Jamie Freed3 Min ReadSYDNEY (Reuters) - Boeing Co will use a pilotless, fighter-like jet developed in Australia as the basis for its U.S. Air Force Skyborg prototype, an executive at the plane maker said on Tuesday.The “Loyal Wingman”, the first military aircraft to be designed and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years, made its first flight on Saturday under the supervision of a Boeing test pilot monitoring it from a ground control station in South Australia.Boeing’s Loyal Wingman is 38 feet long (11.6 metres), has a 2,000 nautical mile (3,704 km) range and a nose that can be outfitted with various payloads. The plane can also carry weapons and act as a shield to help protect more expensive manned fighter jets.The U.S. Air Force in December awarded multi-million dollar contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions to produce unmanned aerial prototypes that can team with crewed jets.“The airpower teaming system is the basis for our Skyborg bid,” Boeing airpower teaming programme director Shane Arnott told reporters. “Obviously the U.S. market is a big market. That is a focus for us, achieving some sort of contract or programme of record in the United States.”Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for cheaper and safer ways to maximise their resources.Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is home to Boeing’s largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing.The Australian government said on Tuesday it would invest a further A$115 million ($89 million) to acquire three more Loyal Wingman aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to develop tactics for using the jets with crewed planes, on top of its initial investment of A$40 million.“Our aim with Boeing is to understand how we can get these aircraft to team with our existing aircraft to be a force multiplier in the future,” RAAF Air-Vice Marshal and head of air force capability Cath Roberts said.Britain in January signed a GBP 30 million ($42 million) contract with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems for a similar type of pilotless aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years.During the test flight in Australia, the Loyal Wingman took off under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify its functionality and demonstrate the performance of the design.Arnott said that three Loyal Wingman aircraft would be used for teaming flights this year and that the Australian government’s order would take the number available to six.Boeing has said up to 16 Loyal Wingman jets could be teamed with a crewed aircraft for missions.($1 = 1.2900 Australian dollars)($1 = 0.7200 pounds)Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

252,PS5 Gold Rush: Restock Accounts Are Making “Thousands” As Scammers Hijack Popular Twitter Profiles,ADBLOCK WARNING,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2021/03/02/5k-profit-ps5-goldrush-is-making-thousands-for-some/,"Sony's PlayStation 5 is hard to find. “The Prize Spot competitions started on the 14th January and ever since have made around £5k profit”. Sami Mehmed runs a popular Twitter account called PS5 UK Stock Alerts, which and has gained 20,000 followers in the last three months by alerting people to available PS5 stock. If you have been on the hunt for the elusive console then you probably follow several similar accounts. Tracking down the PlayStation 5 has become an obsession for many as tiny morsels of stock occasionally surface at a handful of major retailers, often selling out in seconds. These restock accounts orchestrate herds of shoppers towards available units and run community groups - on Telegram or Discord - where people discuss tips and tricks for how to navigate different retailer sites to improve their chances. Mehmed’s community has proven to be profitable for him. Since losing his job because of the pandemic, Mehmed set up this Twitter account when it became clear the new Sony console is in scarce supply. “Since losing my job in early January due to Covid I had more time on my hands, so I decided to create a solution to the PS5 problem by updating people on stock drops. Since the start of 2021 I have helped thousands of people get PS5s whether it be through Twitter or my Telegram channel"".Mehmed also had the idea to set up a giveaway website (called Prize Spot), which holds regular raffles for PS5s and other high-value items. “Those who can't get a PS5 can enter to win one for less than a cup of coffee. That did help support me financially whilst I also kept updating them on stock. So far the raffles have made a few thousand profit most of which had gone into the setting up of the site and company as well as future competitions and other overheads”. A raffle ticket costs £1.99 and Mehmed has given away PS5s - and other tech - to seven winners so far. He says he gets stock from a friend who had bought “a few PS5s” (his friend wasn’t keen on talking to me) and some he’d bought from Amazon and Smyths - presumably using the stock update information he passes on to his followers.  Mehmed is on the legitimate end of a burgeoning side-industry that has shot up since the PlayStation 5 launched last November, which feeds off the current rarity of the console. That desperation has attracted scammers who are keen to prey on frustrated gamers and parents by promising resale consoles at reasonable prices on Twitter and Facebook. On Twitter some high-profile accounts appear to have been hijacked by PS5 scammers. UK Labour party politician Peray Ahmet had her account taken over by someone offering to sell the console. When she got her account back, Ahmet looked through the DMs and found people who appeared to have sent money to the scammers. “There were loads, it was all just stuff like ‘have you got the PlayStation’ and ‘does that mean I’m not getting my PlayStation?..I haven't received it’, or something like that. There were tons of messages, I literally had to go through about 50”  Ahmet explained to me.Are you a PS5 reseller? Or a delivery driver for one of the major retailers? Get in touch.Similarly, the below account claims to be run by an official PlayStation employee and was previously verified. The blue tick was removed at some point and the account biography changed to “partnered salesman for PlayStation since 2016”. The account constantly tweets out offers to sell the console. The account went through a number of changes and eventually lost its verification. But the handle - @gomariotrindade - is exactly the same for Portuguese Paralympic athlete Mario Trindade on Instagram. Mario’s Facebook account is verified and it’s not unreasonable to assume that “Go Mario Trindade” would apply to a gold medallist track athlete. I asked Trindade if this Twitter account used to belong to him but he didn’t respond to my enquiry by the time of writing. Another account that appears to have been hijacked was discovered by Twitter user Terence Eden, who shared screenshots of a profile that had 20,000 followers, was started in 2009, and claimed to sell PS5s. The account belonged to author Tom Jones, who told me he has struggled to get his account back. ""Twitter's response is that they are not even able to locate any history of an account with my email address or username, so it seems like this might have been quite a sophisticated hack. ""It's very frustrating, I spent more than a decade building up more than 20,000 followers for that account, in connecting to my bestselling books on London. Now it's all just being squandered by these hackers, and I can only assume putting other twitter users at risk.""I asked Twitter why it can't find any record of Tom's account and I will update this story if it responds. Ahmet was more fortunate than Tom because she managed to recover her account. Although she told me it took eight days of contacting Twitter daily, in which time more people may have been scammed. “In those eight days they've [Twitter] allowed loads of people to get scammed [even though] they were alerted immediately. And they know it was suspicious because they sent a message to me saying your password has been changed. They should've suspended it pending an investigation. So I’m not too impressed”.I asked Twitter why it took so long to retrieve Ahmet’s page and how a verified account was able to operate scamming people. The company told me that “it is against our rules to use scam tactics on Twitter to obtain money or private financial information. Where we identify violations of our rules, we take robust enforcement action. We're constantly adapting to bad actors’ evolving methods, and we will continue to iterate and improve upon our policies as the industry evolves’’.The supposed PlaySation employee account is still active. Outside of scams, other restock accounts operate purely for the fun of it. One I spoke with, PS5 & Xbox SX Updates, said that they don’t make any money from their work. Rather that they just want to help people buy the console. They also operate Facebook and Telegram community groups. PS5 & Xbox SX Updates says their restock information is based on speculation and knowing trends. But Mehmed uses a more intricate system called Street Merchant. Web security and performance consultant Edward Spencer explained to me how Street Merchant works. ""Street Merchant works by opening up an ""automated"" version of the Chrome browser which will then simulate a human going to specific, pre-defined, pages for a number of items. For example, the software is setup to look at four particular product pages on argos.co.uk - every version of the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X.""When it's running it will browse these product pages after a random time delay, which will help the automated actions look as though they are being done by a human. It will then scrape the contents of the page to see if the product is in stock or not"".Street Merchant can be setup to notify users via email or SMS should it find some in-stock items. The idea is that you leave the software to run on a computer and then carry on with your life whilst it monitors stock levels 24 hours a day. Some restock accounts have managed to automate this process using bots to instantly post updates on Discord or Twitter. This new goldrush will only last as long as PS5 demand outstrips the supply. But at some point Sony will produce enough units to fill that demand. Mehmed is already making preparations for a future where the console is easily available. ""I am well aware of how temporary this ps5 alert system is so I decided once everyone has their PS5 consoles I will switch this account to the official twitter page for Prize Spot"".Are you a PS5 reseller?

253,NASA selects 16 futuristic space technology concepts,Space,https://earthsky.org/space/futuristic-space-technology-concepts-nasa-jpl-niac,"NASA has selected 16 cool new futuristic space technology concepts for further study. Four of them are from NASA’s own Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), including a railway system on the moon to move cargo.One of the new proposals from JPL is FLOAT, where a railway system would be used on the moon to move cargo. Magnetic robots would levitate over the track. Image via Ethan Schaler/ NASA.Space is a busy place these days, relatively speaking, with numerous missions in our solar system exploring planets, asteroids, comets and the sun. All of the excitement and insights of the new space missions are possible because of ever-changing advances in technology. But what about the future? What technological marvels lie ahead?NASA has provided of glimpse of that future, with the selection of 16 new futuristic space technology concepts, including four from NASA’s own Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the space agency announced on February 25, 2021.NASA has approved grants from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program to be given to over a dozen researchers to study their concepts’ feasibility. This includes scientists from NASA itself, industry and academia.As Jenn Gustetic at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) stated:NIAC Fellows are known to dream big, proposing technologies that may appear to border science fiction and are unlike research being funded by other agency programs. We don’t expect them all to come to fruition but recognize that providing a small amount of seed-funding for early research could benefit NASA greatly in the long run.SWIM is an exciting new proposal where centimeter-scale micro-robots would be used to explore the oceans of moons such as Europa and Enceladus. Image via Ethan Schaler/ NASA.STMD has selected 16 Phase I proposals for 2021. Each proposal will receive an initial grant of $125,000 from NASA. Proposals that are successful in their nine month feasibility studies are then eligible to apply for Phase II grants. All proposals are considered to be early-stage technology development efforts with no guarantee of being actual missions.The four JPL proposals include a “railroad” on the moon called Flexible Levitation on a Track (FLOAT), where cargo would autonomously be transported using magnetic robots that would levitate over a flexible track. The tracks would be unrolled on the surface rather than being built in-place. FLOAT robots would have no moving parts and levitate over the track to minimize lunar dust abrasion/ wear, unlike other lunar robots with wheels, legs or tracks.Another proposal, from the same researcher, would be Sensing with Independent Micro-swimmers (SWIM), using centimeter-scale 3-D printed micro-robots to explore the oceans of some of the water worlds in our solar system, such as Europa or Enceladus. The micro-swimmers would be deployed individually or as a swarm from a single SESAME robot mothercraft. This would increase the chances of finding evidence of life in those alien oceans. How cool would that be?ARD3 would be a deep drilling system used to search for liquid water and possible evidence of life below the Martian surface. The ultimate goal would be to drill down as far as 0.9 miles (1.5 km). Image via Planet Enterprises/ James Vaughan Illustration/ NASA.The third JPL proposal is Passively Expanding Dipole Array for Lunar Sounding (PEDALS), a series of dipole antennas on the moon to study the subsurface composition and structure. PEDALS is delivered to or near the surface by a lander or orbiter, can survive moderate impacts if needed, unrolls passively using shape memory materials on the surface, and later, probes the subsurface composition and structure.The fourth JPL proposal is the Solar System Pony Express, where “courier” satellites use optical communications to receive 1-3 petabits of data from a planetary surveyor at least once per year. Then they travel closer to Earth where they are able to quickly downlink the data.The other proposals include:Regolith Adaptive Modification System to Support Early Extraterrestrial Planetary LandingsExploring Uranus: Sustained ChipSat/CubeSat Activity Through Transmitted Electromagnetic Radiation (SCATTER)Ablative Arc Mining for In-Situ Resource UtilizationKilometer-Scale Space Structures from a Single LaunchAutonomous Robotic Demonstrator for Deep Drilling (ARD3)Extrasolar Object Interceptor and Sample Return Enabled by Compact, Ultra Power Dense Radioisotope BatteriesAtomic Planar Power for Lightweight Exploration (APPLE)Titan Sample Return Using In-situ PropellantsReachBot: Small Robot for Large Mobile Manipulation Tasks in Martian Cave EnvironmentsFarView: In-situ Manufactured Lunar Far Side Radio ObservatoryMaking Soil for Space Habitats by Seeding Asteroids with FungiLight BenderThe Titan Sample Return Using In-Situ Propellants mission would obtain samples from the surface of Saturn’s largest moon Titan and bring them back to Earth for study. Image via Steven Oleson/ NASA.ReachBot would be designed to explore caves or vertical cliff walls on Mars, something that current rovers can’t easily do. Who knows what might be discovered?The Titan Sample Return Using In-Situ Propellants mission would obtain samples from the surface of Saturn’s largest moon Titan and bring them back to Earth for study. This could provide crucial clues to the origin of life on Earth, since Titan is similar to what the primordial Earth was like a few billion years ago. Some scientists even think that Titan’s methane seas and lakes might be able to support some form of very un-earthly life even today.Autonomous Robotic Demonstrator for Deep Drilling (ARD3) would be a deep drilling system used to search for liquid water and possible evidence of life below the Martian surface. The ultimate goal would be to drill down as far as 0.9 miles (1.5 km). The rover would drill below the layered deposits at the south pole, where evidence for subsurface lakes has already been found.In the Kilometer-Scale Space Structures from a Single Launch proposal, one-kilometer long (0.6 miles) deployable structures could be launched into orbit with a single rocket launch. That would be large enough to produce artificial gravity for astronauts. Image via Zachary Mancheste/ Tzipora Thompson/ NASA.It will be interesting to see which of these proposals move on to Phase II. Some, of course, might be more exciting to the public than others, but all present important new ideas to further advance space technology in the 21st century. NIAC Program Executive Jason Derleth said:There is an overwhelming number of new participants in the program this year. All but two of the researchers selected for Phase I awards will be first-time NIAC grant recipients, showing that NASA’s early-stage opportunities continue to engage new creative thinkers from all over the country.Bottom line: NASA has selected 16 new futuristic space technology concepts for further study.Via JPLPaul Scott Anderson has had a passion for space exploration that began when he was a child when he watched Carl Sagan’s Cosmos.

254,Twitter will label COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and enforce a strike system,Social Media,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system,"Filed under:Repeatedly sharing misleading information can lead to your account being lockedTwitter announced Monday that it will start labeling tweets that share misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. The labels will include links to relevant information from official bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Twitter plans to enforce a five-strike system for repeat offenders that can lead to locked accounts and permanent suspension.The new labels are similar to Facebook’s anti-misinformation banners or the labels Twitter began deploying early in the pandemic. They appear as text underneath misleading tweets, with links to information from official sources or Twitter’s rules. Twitter says it applies these labels through a combination of human and automated review systems and is starting its rollout with English-language content first.Twitter has specific criteria for labeling in its COVID-19 misleading information policy, but generally, the company targets five categories of false or misleading information: Labels also feed into the new strike system for COVID-19 misinformation. A harmful, labeled tweet counts as one strike. If Twitter determines the misinformation is particularly dangerous in its questioning of COVID-19 treatments and invokes a larger conspiracy connected to the virus (like the idea that vaccines include microchips for tracking people), the company may also delete the tweet, which counts as two strikes. From there, account-level strikes accrue, triggering different actions from Twitter. Appending labels has been part of the larger strategy to fight misinformation Twitter used during the 2020 election, adding labels to tweets from politicians — including the former president — when they included inaccurate information. While the labels seem helpful, they don’t necessarily deter people from sharing the information. Holding real punishment like a suspension until there have been five bad tweets also means that misinformation could spread with only some text as a warning.

255,"A folding iPhone could be coming in 2023, says Ming-Chi Kuo",Hardware,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo,"Filed under:It’s rumored to have an iPad Mini-like screen sizeRumors about a folding iPhone are nothing new, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (who has a very strong track record) is weighing in with information of his own: he says that Apple could be looking at a 2023 launch, and that the phone could have a screen between 7.5 and eight inches (via MacRumors). Previous rumors have suggested that the screen would be smaller, closer to the size of an iPhone 12 Pro Max.  There have been numerous reports about Apple prototyping a folding iPhone, but according to MacRumors, Kuo says that the product has “not yet officially kicked off.” Meanwhile, competitors like Samsung, Motorola, and Royole have all released multiple foldable phones (though they’re mostly expensive and clearly early implementations of the tech). According to Kuo, the screen will be iPad Mini-sized when folded out, so it seems as if Apple is going for the Galaxy Fold approach of having a regular-sized phone that folds out into a small tablet, rather than the Z Flip or Razr approach of having a compact folding phone. (This is a bummer to me, but it seems like the folding phablet approach is the most popular at the moment.) It’s unclear who would be making those folding displays — there have been rumors of Apple working with both LG and Samsung.While the rumors of a prototype and this report from Kuo indicate that Apple is indeed working on a folding phone, it’s not something to wait around for just yet. Kuo’s 2023 launch date is dependent on Apple being able to figure out “key technology and mass production issues.” As we’ve seen, folding phones can be hard to get right. If Apple can do it, though, it could be in the position to do what it does best: adopt a technology after other companies have figured out the bugs and pitfalls, and release a product that seems polished in comparison.

256,US drone firm Skydio valued at $1 billion as government freezes out Chinese competition,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded,"Filed under:Government grounding of DJI drones creates new opportunities for US firmsSkydio has become the first US dronemaker with a valuation of more than $1 billion, a signal of deeper investment in American-made drones after the US government blacklisted Chinese manufacturers. The California-based Skydio raised $170 million in a Series D funding round led by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, as first reported by The Financial Times. Skydio’s drones are best known for their self-flying tech, which allows the aircraft to autonomously navigate obstacles and track users on the ground. The company released its first drone in 2018, the $2500 R1, aiming the product at consumers. It followed this up with the smarter and much cheaper $999 Skydio 2 in 2019, and last year announced its first drone aimed specifically at enterprise and military customers: the X2. Putting new emphasis on enterprise products makes sense given that the sector is the fastest-growing in the drone market. Data gathered by Valuates Reports, and reported by the FT, says the global market for commercial drones will grow from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $35 billion in 2026. As well as opportunities in areas like construction and surveying, where self-flying drones can be used to map terrain and buildings with minimal pilot training, the US government is also set to be a big future customer for firms like Skydio.After the US Armed Forces, Pentagon, and Department of the Interior grounded drones with Chinese components over espionage fears, there have been new opportunities for American competitors. Although Chinese drone giant DJI still dominates consumer sales, with an estimated 70 percent market share, it can no longer sell to US government clients. DJI’s clout in the sector, though, has already contributed to the demise of US firms like GoPro and 3D Robotics, which abandoned consumer sales over the last few years. Skydio’s X2 drone, which comes with integrated thermal camera and enterprise-grade controller, looks set to fill this new gap in the market. The X2 is already likely to be an official US Army drone after making it to the final round of procurement in the army’s Short Range Reconnaissance Program, and Wired reports that Skydio also has contracts with the Air Force and DEA. The firm is also working with at least one police department in California. Skydio’s drones will be used for emergency response, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and the company says it has no plans to weaponize its tech. It’s also working on new consumer drones, too. “We have more products coming in that market that we’re excited about,” Skydio CEO Adam Bry told The Verge last year, though it’s not clear when these will be launched.

259,Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket is delayed for years. What went wrong? - The big delay can be traced to a decision Jeff Bezos made years ago.,Space,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/so-what-really-happened-with-blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket/,"Front page layoutSite themeSign up or login to join the discussions!
Eric Berger
    -  Mar 1, 2021 7:35 pm UTC
In the fall of 2017, shortly after he became chief executive officer of Blue Origin, Bob Smith received an extensive briefing on the state of the New Glenn rocket program. The projected launch date for the massive, reusable rocket was 2020, he was told.As Smith assessed the progress on New Glenn to date and drew upon his long experience at Honeywell Aerospace, he soon came to the conclusion that this launch date was unreasonable. ""This is not a 2020 launch program,"" he said at this meeting. ""This is a 2022 program, at best.""Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos was not present for this, but his response afterward was that he would absolutely not accept any revision to the launch date for the large orbital rocket. Blue Origin should be optimistic with its projections, Bezos said. And then they should meet those projections.Bezos' rocket company, of course, did not meet those projections. Not only did New Glenn not launch in 2020, last week Blue Origin said it would not launch until the fourth quarter of 2022, at the earliest. As part of its announcement, Blue Origin also did not take much blame for the rocket's delay—instead, the company blamed the delay mostly on a potential customer, the US Department of Defense.""Who does that?"" asked one former employee of the company. ""That excuse makes no sense.""Blue Origin's New Glenn project is incredibly ambitious. If successfully developed, it would offer a revolutionary heavy-lift service to low Earth orbit, geostationary space, and even the Moon. So what really has gone wrong? Ars spoke with several former employees and industry officials familiar with the company for this story.As part of his overall space strategy, Bezos has been thinking about building a large, reusable orbital rocket for a long time. Step one was to learn how to reuse rockets with the much smaller New Shepard launch system, which consists of a single-engine booster and capsule. And the company's engineers have—over the last five years, New Shepard successfully completed more than a dozen suborbital missions with picture-perfect rocket landings.But long before New Shepard took its first flight, Bezos was already deep into planning his next rocket. During a meeting in December 2011 with then-NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, Bezos discussed an orbital rocket capable of challenging SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster. As Christian Davenport recounts in his book The Space Barons, Bezos told Garver at the time, ""I want to tell you about my big rocket.""The ""big rocket"" at the time—which would become known publicly as New Glenn more than half a decade later—was not quite so big as New Glenn is envisioned today. Rather than being powered by seven BE-4 engines and towering nearly as tall as NASA's famed Saturn V rocket, Bezos originally envisioned a more modest-sized rocket comparable to the Falcon 9 or United Launch Alliance's single-stick Delta IV. In some iterations, New Glenn had just three main engines.This would have represented a more incremental step for a launch company that has yet to put a gram of material into orbit. But instead of offering a waypoint between New Shepard and a massive orbital rocket, Bezos ultimately opted to jump right to the massive, 313-foot-tall version. ""It's like if NASA had gone straight from Alan Shepard to the Saturn V rocket, but then also had to make the Saturn V reusable,"" one former Blue Origin employee said.Instead of crawl-walk-run, Bezos asked his engineering team to begin sprinting toward the launch pad. The engineering challenges of building such a large rocket are big enough. But because New Glenn is so expensive to build, the company needs to recover it from the outset. SpaceX enjoyed a learning curve with the Falcon 9, only successfully recovering the first stage on the rocket's 20th launch. Blue Origin engineers will be expected to bring New Glenn back safely on its very first mission.The decision to skip the ""walk"" part of the company's development has cost Blue Origin dearly, sources say. The company's engineering teams, composed of smart and talented people, are struggling with mighty technical challenges. And there are only so many lessons that can be learned from New Shepard—the smaller rocket has 110,000 pounds of thrust, and New Glenn will have very nearly 4 million.It's not just the challenging engineering. Since Smith arrived in the fall of 2017, some employees have struggled with his leadership style and complained that he has acted too slowly, pushing Blue Origin to become more like a traditional aerospace company than a nimble new-space startup. But from Smith's perspective, he's trying to implement a culture transformation, from a hobby-shop atmosphere to that of a major aerospace contractor that can go out and win major NASA and Defense Department contracts.As a result, Blue Origin is now juggling a number of other major projects in addition to New Glenn. There is the ongoing effort to put humans onto suborbital New Shepard flights, which may happen as soon as late spring or early summer. This has been a long slog, as Bezos once suggested humans may fly on the suborbital launch system as early as 2017.There is work on the BE-4 engine itself, which will ultimately power New Glenn. As part of its development process, Blue Origin engineers pushed through significant turbopump issues. Technicians and engineers are working hard to deliver flight-ready BE-4 rocket engines to United Launch Alliance, an important customer, by this summer. This is probably Blue Origin's most immediate priority.Blue Origin is also leading the ""National Team,"" which includes industry heavyweights such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, that seeks to build a lander for human missions to the Moon. This is a heated, high-profile competition with two other bidders, SpaceX and a Dynetics-led team, and the prize is billions of dollars in contracts and enormous prestige in carrying astronauts down to the surface of the Moon. NASA is expected to pick one or two finalists in April to move forward. Bezos desperately wants to prevail here.So how does Bob Smith manage these programs internally? Clearly, for now, New Glenn has taken a back seat. The vehicle's delay to the fourth quarter of 2022—and let's be honest, that means at least 2023—comes down to a combination of two things. First, there is the enormity of the engineering challenge, which is due to Bezos' decision to opt for a larger New Glenn design. Secondly, Blue Origin simply has higher priorities right now.The sources for this article agreed that none of this reflects a diminution of interest in space by Jeff Bezos, who remains the world's richest person. He is a true believer in exploring the cosmos and feels as though it is his role to lay down the infrastructure that will allow humans to build factories in space, develop artificial worlds known as O'Neill cylinders, and to preserve Earth.Bezos' vision is compelling. He recently announced a decision to step away from Amazon, which will give him more time to work on Blue Origin and perhaps allow him to bring this vision into better focus.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

261,How a tiny startup is reinventing the DVR for the cord-cutter era,Business,https://www.fastcompany.com/90609133/channels-dvr-playon-record-streaming-tv-video,"An award-winning team of journalists, designers, and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company's distinctive lensThe future of innovation and technology in government for the greater goodOur annual guide to the businesses that matter the mostLeaders who are shaping the future of business in creative waysNew workplaces, new food sources, new medicine--even an entirely new economic systemCelebrating the best ideas in businessThe rise of cord cutting and streaming video was supposed to render the digital video recorder (DVR) irrelevant. In theory, you shouldn’t need to record anything when services like Netflix and Amazon Prime make everything available on demand.But now that every big media company has its own streaming service, all that instant gratification has come at a cost. Watching TV now means bouncing between a dozen different apps, each with its own separate menu system, catalog, and watch list. Say what you will about the stodginess of cable, at least it put everything in one place.That’s why a tiny company called Fancy Bits, founded by a pair of former GitHub employees, is bringing the DVR back. The company’s $8 per month Channels service takes video from a wide range of sources—online cable channel feeds, live-streaming apps, over-the-air broadcasts, and even on-demand services like Netflix—and pulls it all into one menu. It does this primarily by letting users create their own personal copies of the content, just like an old-school DVR.[Image courtesy of Channels]In doing so, Channels is performing an end run around streaming TV’s thorniest problem. While tech titans like Google, Apple, and Amazon are racing to build their own unified TV guides with the blessing of major streaming services, Channels is achieving the same goal by ignoring those companies entirely.“It’s funny, right? Because what we’re building towards is something that was sort of built 20 years ago,” says Jon Maddox, one of Fancy Bits’ cofounders. “Really, we’re just trying to make this single place for people to go watch their TV that everybody is looking for.”Setting up a Channels DVR is an admittedly nerdy endeavor, similar to configuring media center applications like Plex or Emby. Users install Channels on a server device, which can be a desktop computer, a network-attached storage device, an Nvidia Shield TV streaming box, or a Raspberry Pi mini-PC. Video then streams over Wi-Fi to Channels’ viewer apps on Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, iOS, and Android.Channels’ creators are serious about making the app simple and dependable once it’s up and running.Last month, Channels also introduced a tie-in with PlayOn, a long-running service for recording video from on-demand sources such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. Users can set up recordings through PlayOn’s mobile app, and once they’re complete, Channels can automatically download the video to watch through its own DVR apps.Fancy Bits cofounder, Aman Karmani [Photo: Fancy Bits]Maddox and cofounder Aman Karmani acknowledge that setting this all up isn’t particularly straightforward. But for users, assembling a lineup of sources—and then having control over the content they record—is part of the appeal.“You still have knobs you can tweak,” Karmani says. “It feels kind of like Legos.”At the same time, Channels’ creators are serious about making the app simple and dependable once it’s up and running. The software takes cues from traditional DVRs like TiVo, with features like series recordings, team passes for sports, and the ability to time shift any live program. It also nails a lot of the little touches that made traditional DVR so pleasant, like progress indicators for shows you’re currently watching and a list of recently recorded programs. It can also detect commercial breaks and skip over them automatically.“The best compliment we get is when people say that their family loves it,” Karmani says. “Because how many families love their media center solutions? None of them.”For years, Channels was just a side project for Maddox and Karmani, who were both among GitHub’s earliest employees. On nights and weekends, they started off collaborating on media server software, but they moved onto live TV after discovering HDHomeRun, a line of devices that can stream live TV from an antenna or CableCARD to other devices around the house.When Apple released its third-generation Apple TV, Maddox and Karmani started working on HDHomeRun support, but because that device had no app store, the best they could do was rely on a hack that made their videos show up inside Apple’s Trailers app. The fourth-generation Apple TV, however, was a breakthrough, allowing them to stream video natively from HDHomeRun tuners. And for the first time, they could actually sell their software; the first version of Channels hit the App Store in November 2015.“Getting it to run on a platform that was built with an app store, all of a sudden it was like, ‘Hey, this could be a thing,'” Maddox says.Fancy Bits cofounder, Jon Maddox [Photo: Fancy Bits]Even so, Channels remained a hobby for a few more years as Maddox and Karmani slowly added more features. First came the ability to time shift live TV, then came full-blown DVR support and apps for Fire TV and Android TV devices. They also brought in a third team member, Papertrail cofounder Eric Lindvall, to work on infrastructure for features like out-of-home viewing. Along the way, Channels built up an enthusiastic user base, but never enough to make leaving GitHub a safe bet.The calculation changed as GitHub ballooned in size, eventually getting acquired by Microsoft in 2018. While Maddox and Karmani say they both enjoyed working at GitHub, neither of them wanted to work at a large company. Karmani had already left before the acquisition, and while Maddox had been less certain about whether to stay, they both convinced one another to turn Channels into a full-time job in early 2019.Channels won’t say exactly how many users it has, but Maddox says the number is in the “thousands,” and that their decision to work on it full-time was the right one.“It was honestly this or stay at GitHub,” he says. “But it was tough for me to not pursue this, because, holy cow, we’re making money on a hobby.”Post-GitHub, Channels seems to have taken on a renewed purpose. Instead of just relying on CableCARDs and antennas, it now pulls in video from live and on-demand streaming sources. That in turn makes it more like a universal DVR, rather than just an alternative app for HDHomeRun enthusiasts.“We’re at a point now that what customers are demanding is essentially cable,” Maddox says. “They’re tired of segmented content and disparities all over the place, using apps that have different browse flows, and different watch lists, and all of that. They want one place.”Still, modern streaming platforms are unlikely to come up with a perfect solution on their own. Google, for instance, is trying to build a unified menu system through its Google TV platform, yet it recently lost a big chunk of its Netflix integration, and support for features like its “Continue Watching” row can vary by service. Apple’s unified “TV” guide doesn’t integrate with Netflix either, and Amazon’s Fire TV devices offer no easy way to resume watching shows from across different services.[Image courtesy of Channels]While streaming services are slowly moving in the direction of more integration, none of them wants to give up too much control. “Each streaming service wants to keep as much data about how customers search, find, and watch content as possible,” says Avi Greengart, the president and lead analyst at Techsponential.This desire leaves streamers wanting to send people into their individual apps whenever possible. “That way they get to present content the way they want to, and are more likely to get your next hour, not just your first one,” Greengart says.Channels, then, is a way for consumers to take back some control. Once the DVR makes a recording, users can keep it for as long as they want and use it however they please, and the integration with PlayOn means users can bring in on-demand sources like Netflix. They never have to worry about streaming services dropping their favorite movies or shows, and the amount of video they can keep is only limited by the size of their hard drives.“People have an ownership over this with Channels, I think,” Maddox says. “They feel like it’s theirs. They can do stuff with their own content.”All of this unapproved recording does get into some murky territory—if not legally than at least from a terms-of-service perspective. While legal protection for personal recordings dates back to the 1980s with the Betamax case, streaming services generally don’t allow users to make copies of their content.The idea of sitting in meetings with a bunch of execs at Peacock is not going to be appealing, because we know it’s not going to be productive.”“We’ve never been challenged, because it’s likely that they would lose, and they don’t want to lose,” Burman says.Likewise, Fancy Bits takes its own steps to avoid running afoul of copyright law with Channels. Users who connect their pay TV service only get the channels they’re entitled to watch, and aren’t allowed to record from pirated content sources.To some extent, services like Channels may also avoid scrutiny by staying small. Maddox and Karmani have no big plans for marketing Channels other than by word of mouth, and they consider themselves a small business rather than a startup looking for an exit. They even seem unenthused about the idea of making their service easier to set up through pre-built hardware—say, a plug-and-play networkable box with its own storage and Channels’ server built in.“All of a sudden you’re talking about inventory, and logistics, and shipping,” Karmani says. “We just don’t know anything about that or feel like it’s a good use of our time.”The same goes with reaching out directly to streaming services, in hopes of integrating their content. Karmani says they’ve never tried, and probably never will.“The idea of sitting in meetings with a bunch of execs at Peacock is not going to be appealing, because we know it’s not going to be productive for us, and it’s not going to be fun for us,” he says.The future of Channels, then, is to keep doing what it’s always done. That means appealing to people who don’t mind tinkering a little bit, and giving them a long-lost way to centralize all their content. Because for the most part, no one else will.“We’ve really enjoyed building this piece of software that’s bridging that past and the future,” Maddox says.Sign up for Jared’s Cord Cutter Weekly newsletter for more news, tips, and insights on cutting cable or satellite TV.Jared Newman covers apps and technology from his remote Cincinnati outpost.

262,Lawsuit accuses Amazon of 'systemic' racism in corporate offices,Society,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-lawsuit-racism/lawsuit-accuses-amazon-of-systemic-racism-in-corporate-offices-idUSKCN2AT3RE,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Jonathan Stempel, Jeffrey Dastin3 Min Read(Reuters) - A manager at Amazon.com Inc sued the online retailer for discrimination on Monday, saying it hires Black people for lower positions and promotes them more slowly than white workers, and that she was subjected to harassment.The lawsuit from Charlotte Newman, a business development head at Amazon Web Services who is Black, said the company suffers from a “systemic pattern of insurmountable discrimination,” despite its pledge to fight racism and statements of solidarity from Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos.Seattle-based Amazon said it was investigating the claims. It said it strives for an equitable culture and has no tolerance for discrimination: “These allegations do not reflect those efforts or our values.”The complaint was filed in Washington, D.C., federal court.Newman, a Harvard Business School graduate and former adviser to U.S. Senator Cory Booker, said Amazon delayed by 2-1/2 years her rise to senior manager by hiring her in 2017 for a more junior role for which she was overqualified, a “de-leveling” that reduces awards of company stock.She also accused a male supervisor of using racial tropes by calling her “aggressive,” “too direct” and “just scary,” and another male co-worker of sexually harassing her and once pulling on her braids while saying, “You can leave this behind.”Both men were also named as defendants, and according to the lawsuit the supervisor was required to undergo training while the co-worker was terminated. The co-worker’s lawyer could not immediately be identified.Newman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Douglas Wigdor, who also represented women suing the former movie producer Harvey Weinstein and Fox News over alleged harassment or discrimination.Amazon has worked to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In September its cloud computing chief Andy Jassy, who will succeed Bezos as Amazon CEO, gave the keynote address at a Black Employee Network entrepreneurship conference.The news site Recode last week reported allegations of racial disparities in Amazon promotions and performance reviews.Amazon also faces lawsuits claiming it mistreated workers in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic at its facilities.Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Howard Goller and Cynthia OstermanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Nico Grant, Bloomberg NewsThe U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Google’s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.The U.S. government alleges Google’s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.’s iPhones, violates the Sherman Act’s prohibition on monopolization.

During the five-year period, China’s GDP increased to 101.6 trillion yuan ($15.71 trillion), from 68.9 trillion yuan in 2015.For 2020 alone, carbon intensity fell 1% from a year earlier, according to a statement issued by the National Bureau of Statistic on Sunday.President Xi Jinping has pledged to cap carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve the carbon neutrality by 2060. To meet commitments made under the Paris Climate Accord, China has been boosting renewable energy consumption and curbing coal burning to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.China will have to improve energy efficiency and further reduce its use of coal to meet Xi’s goal.A new carbon intensity target is expected to be contained, along with other climate-related targets such as energy consumption control, in a five year plan for 2021-2025 that is due to be presented to China’s parliament later this month.The ministry’s statement said heavy metals, in particular cadmium, were major pollutants endangering the quality of China’s farmland, while also saying that more than 90% of the total contaminated arable land last year was safe for agriculture.The ministry also warned that the water quality had deteriorated in the past year in the offshore marine areas near Shanghai and the eastern province of Jiangsu.($1 = 6.4665 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Muyu Xu and Shivani Singh; Editng by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

267,Verizon admitted 5G might be a big battery drain without admitting it,Networking/Telecom,https://mashable.com/article/verizon-5g-battery-drain-support-tweet/,"This probably wouldn't merit any discussion if Verizon hadn't been so unnecessarily shady. It's tough when your phone battery drains fast, but most people recognize that new features and tech can have that effect.In a Sunday morning tweet, the wireless provider offered up a suggestion for customers struggling with a fast-draining battery. And while the substance of the advice boils down to ""turn off 5G if your phone supports it,"" that's not actually what Verizon's tweet said.Are you noticing that your battery life ðŸ”‹ is draining faster than normal? One way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE. ðŸ“² Just go to Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Voice & Data and tap LTE. ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€â€” Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) February 28, 2021""Are you noticing that your battery life is draining faster than normal?"" the tweet, which Verizon apparently deleted while this story was being written, asks. ""One way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE."" (h/t The Verge for spotting the tweet)While the advice is technically accurate, it's also misleading. See, LTE is active by default as a backup for those times when 5G isn't available. Following these instructions actually has the effect of turning off 5G.But wait, things get weirder. At one point, a Verizon Twitter follower noted the dissonance between the company promoting ""new 5G ultra-speedy phones"" while also coming up with advice for battery drain issues that amounts to ""hey turn off your 5G."" It's hard to read the company's response as anything other than a straight-up deflection.It's important that we complete many troubleshooting steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed. We are quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds. If you have other questions or concerns, please feel free to follow and DM us. *ACAâ€” Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) February 28, 2021Do you see what's happening here? The initial tweet was about troubleshooting battery drain issues. But this Verizon response changes the subject and makes the conversation about speed issues. This is despite the fact that the tweet it's replying to wasn't citing speed or battery issues; it was putting the company on blast for sending mixed messages.None of this is a huge deal when all is said and done. But there's real ""the cover-up is worse than the crime"" energy emanating from the whole situation. Yeah, 5G is probably a source of battery drain. People might have gotten mad if Verizon had just up and said that, but it still would've been the truth.SEE ALSO: Pixel 5a leaks, looks pretty much the same as Pixel 4a 5GInstead, the company tried to play PR games and shift the message away from ""5G is a battery drain"" to make it more of a ""LTE is a battery preserver"" kind of thing. Then, when someone pointed out the fact that those two things are the same, the response was a performatively oblivious change of subject. As if all that wasn't enough, Verizon just up and deleted the tweet as media organizations took notice.The whole thing is just odd and unnecessary. People on the internet are smart enough to see through this. Verizon would do well to remember in the future that a little transparency can go along way."

Verizon has spent years hyping 5G despite it bringing just a minor speed upgrade outside the limited areas where millimeter-wave spectrum has been deployed, but the carrier's support team advised users yesterday to shut 5G off if their phones are suffering from poor battery life.The tweet from VZWSupport, now deleted, said, ""Are you noticing that your battery life is draining faster than normal? One way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE. Just go to Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Voice & Data and tap LTE.""While Verizon didn't mention 5G in the tweet, people who responded to Verizon on Twitter and journalists writing stories noted that the effect of these instructions is to shut 5G off. ""LTE is active by default as a backup for those times when 5G isn't available. Following these instructions actually has the effect of turning off 5G,"" Mashable noted. (Verizon's instructions are for iOS, but it's also possible to disable 5G on Android phones.)An Ars story in December 2018 warned that 5G components would take up precious space inside smartphones, reducing the size of batteries. In October 2020, the Ars review of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro noted that ""5G seems to have a big impact on battery life, especially when you're riding that ultra-fast mmWave.""Apple said it implemented a ""Smart Data mode"" that shifts each phone from 5G to LTE when 5G speeds aren't necessary, saving on battery life while letting phones use 5G when the speed boost would provide a noticeable difference. Enabling ""5G Auto"" in the iPhone settings turns Smart Data mode on; the other choices are ""5G On"" and ""LTE."" Apple notes that the 5G On mode ""Always uses 5G network when it's available. This might reduce battery life.""We asked Verizon for more details on the impact 5G is having on its users' battery life today and will update this article if we get a response.Verizon's tweet came just a few days after its latest 5G announcement that ""parts of Sacramento, Seattle, and Pensacola"" are the newest areas targeted by Verizon's ""aggressive rollout of its transformational 5G Ultra Wideband service."" Verizon also just committed to spend $45.45 billion in an auction for mid-band spectrum that it plans to use with 5G.Other phone makers have acknowledged 5G-related battery drains in support pages. Samsung tells users, ""You may notice that your phone's battery drains faster than usual while you are connected to a 5G network. This is a limitation of the current 5G networks, and will be improved as the networks expand."" Samsung's support page continues:At this time, the 5G networks are only used for data connections, and are not yet capable of carrying phone calls and messages. Your phone will need to maintain a connection to the 3G or LTE network in addition to the 5G network so that phone calls, text messages, and data will be delivered consistently.Because your phone is connected to multiple networks simultaneously, the battery will drain faster than one would typically expect, and the phone may get warmer than when solely on 3G or LTE.As the 5G networks grow in capacity and capability, they will be able to handle more of your phone's functions with less battery drain.The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) backs the multiple-networks explanation. Hopping between 3G, 4G, and LTE uses a lot of battery life, and the ""present limited infrastructure of 5G exacerbates this [battery-drain] problem,"" the IEEE says. ""Current 5G smartphones need to maintain a connection to multiple networks in order to ensure consistent phone call, text message, and data delivery. And this multiplicity of connections contributes to battery drain.""A Huawei support page tells users they may suffer faster battery drain on 5G compared to 4G, especially when streaming video. ""On a 5G network, more bandwidth is required to create a smooth user experience when using the Internet,"" Huawei says. ""Therefore, more power may be consumed, especially when using the Internet to watch online videos.""The wireless industry deployed 5G before carriers were ready to use the ""standalone 5G"" version that doesn't require a connection to 4G networks. But that's changing, as T-Mobile launched standalone 5G throughout much of the US in August 2020, while Verizon and AT&T have plans to follow suit.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

269,Fcc approved to offer up to $50 a month to low-income households and up to $75 a month to households on Native American land for broadband service.,Business,https://www.cnet.com/news/fcc-approves-50-a-month-emergency-broadband-subsidies/,"The agency has approved rules to get the $3.2 billion COVID-19 relief fund up and running for people hit by the pandemic.Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the $50-a-month subsidy will help ensure that poor families hit hard by the pandemic can get access to the internet to do things like attend school remotely and access health care.  The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a plan to administer $3.2 billion in emergency relief to subsidize broadband for millions of poor Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The four-member commission unanimously voted to approve rules to the program that will offer up to $50 a month to low-income households and up to $75 a month to households on Native American land for broadband service. The FCC will also provide a one-time discount to poor households of up to $100 to purchase a computer or tablet. The program will be available to eligible households within 60 days, said Jessica Rosenworcel, the acting chairwoman of the FCC. The agency still needs to sign up broadband providers that will administer and accept the discounts. ""This is a program that will help those at risk of digital disconnection,"" Rosenworcel said in a statement. ""It will help those sitting in cars in parking lots just to catch a Wi-Fi signal to go online for work. It will help those lingering outside the library with a laptop just to get a wireless signal for remote learning.""Rosenworcel began circulating her proposal, called the Emergency Broadband Benefit, among FCC commissioners earlier this week. The plan puts into action money Congress allocated in December as part of the COVID-19 relief bill. Congress stipulated that the money would be available to households that are at the poverty line or 135 percent above it, those who qualify for free and reduced school lunches, or people who have experienced substantial loss of income since Feb. 29, 2020.The FCC estimates that at least 14.5 million homes don't have access to broadband. The pandemic has shined a light on the inequities between people with and without access to high-speed internet. For millions of Americans, the digital divide exists because they live in a rural part of the country where broadband infrastructure simply isn't available. For other families in rural and suburban markets, broadband service may be available but unaffordable. During the pandemic, students without internet service haven't been able to attend school. And adults who can't go into offices have been unable to work remotely. Policy makers have tried for years to resolve the digital divide. Despite billions of dollars being spent each year to subsidize the cost of building new infrastructure and to offset the cost of service for poor Americans, the problem persists. It hasn't helped that the FCC for years has been addressing these problems using maps that don't accurately reflect where broadband service exists and where it doesn't. Congress and the FCC agree that the broadband mapping issue needs to be fixed. At the FCC's February meeting, Rosenworcel launched a task force to fulfill Congress' mandate to improve the FCC's broadband maps."

The creation of the nine-member panel, which includes anti-bullying and mental health experts, follows the US Content Advisory Council the Chinese-owned platform formed last March. TikTok's European delegates include academics and members of non-profits that specialize in dealing with child abuse, addiction, violent extremism, discrimination and cyber-bullying. It says the council will help it to develop ""forward-looking policies"" that address current and emerging challenges facing its thriving community. While the above issues aren't strictly limited to the video-sharing platform and affect all social networks alike, TikTok is facing heightened scrutiny in Europe over security and privacy concerns that relate to the welfare of its younger user base.EU watchdogs had already launched a glut of probes investigating its data-sharing practices before the app was hit with a massive consumer complaint last month. In it, a grouping of consumer watchdogs alleged it was breaking GDPR laws by hoarding personal information, hiding its policies behind vague terms and conditions and blurring the line between advertising and user-generated content. At the time, TikTok said it was ready to meet with the consumer organizations (a collective known as the BEUC) to discuss their concerns. Despite some of its failings, its latest move is also aimed at engaging with regulators as it seeks to further promote its user safety policies.Please enter a valid email address"
271,EU law requires companies to fix electronic goods for up to 10 years | Euronews,Business,https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/01/eu-law-requires-companies-to-fix-electronic-goods-for-up-to-10-years,"WorldShare this articleCompanies that sell refrigerators, washers, hairdryers, or TVs in the European Union will need to ensure those appliances can be repaired for up to 10 years, to help reduce the vast mountain of electrical waste that piles up each year on the continent.The ""right to repair,"" as it is sometimes called, comes into force across the 27-nation bloc on Monday. It is part of a broader effort to cut the environmental footprint of manufactured goods by making them more durable and energy-efficient.“This is a really big step in the right direction,” said Daniel Affelt of the environmental group BUND-Berlin, which runs several ""repair cafes"" where people can bring in their broken appliances and get help fixing them up again.Modern appliances are often glued or riveted together, he said. “If you need special tools or have to break open the device, then you can’t repair it.”Lack of spare parts is another problem, campaigners say. Sometimes a single broken tooth on a tiny plastic sprocket can throw a proverbial wrench in the works.“People want to repair their appliances,” Affelt said. “When you tell them that there are no spare parts for a device that’s only a couple of years old then they are obviously really frustrated by that.”Under the new EU rules, manufacturers will have to ensure parts are available for up to a decade, though some will only be provided to professional repair companies to ensure they are installed correctly.New devices will also have to come with repair manuals and be made in such a way that they can be dismantled using conventional tools when they really can't be fixed anymore, to improve recycling.Each year, Europeans produce more than 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of electrical waste per person. About half of that junk is due to broken household appliances, and the EU recycles only about 40% of it, leaving behind huge amounts of potentially hazardous material.German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that the next step should see manufacturers forced to state how long a product is expected to work for and repair it if it breaks down earlier. This would encourage companies to build more durable products, she said.“In the repair cafes we see a lot of devices that broke shortly after the warranty expired,” said Affelt — a phenomenon that has prompted some environmentalists to accuse manufacturers of designing their devices with planned obsolescence.Knowing an appliance will really last for a decade might prompt consumers to choose products that are more durable or can be easily fixed, he said.“For the vast majority of devices, repair is the right choice,"" said Affelt, adding that the exception might be old, inefficient refrigerators that can contain powerful greenhouse gases which fuel climate change.In a next step, environmentalists and consumer rights groups want the “right to repair” expanded to include smartphones, laptops and other small electrical devices.Responding to growing demand, Apple last year announced it would start providing training and spare parts to certified independent repair stores fixing Mac computers, not just iPhones.Right to repair bills have been introduced in several U.S. state legislatures, attracting bipartisan support, though as yet there is no nationwide measure in force.Sweden has gone further than most of the EU, making repairs and spare parts subject to lower value-added tax.The bloc's ecological design directive — of which the right to repair requirement is a part — will also revise existing energy labels that describe how much electricity washers and other household devices consume. The new seven-step scale from A to G will be complemented by a QR code that provides consumers with further information, such as how loud the devices are.Share this article"
272,"Highland Electric Raises $235M, Lands Biggest Electric School Bus Contract in the US: Maryland county taps startup’s all-inclusive EV fleet leasing model to break upfront cost barriers to electrification.",Business,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/on-heels-of-253m-raise-highland-electric-lands-biggest-electric-school-bus-contract-in-the-u.s,"Maryland county taps startup’s all-inclusive EV fleet leasing model to break upfront cost barriers to electrification.Senior Editor Greentech MediaHighland Electric Transportation's all-inclusive service model for electric school buses has landed a big VC investment and a major U.S. contract. Electric school buses don’t just eliminate the carbon and pollution emissions of their diesel-fueled counterparts; they also cost less to fuel and maintain over the long haul. Unfortunately for cash-strapped school districts, the upfront cost to purchase an electric school bus is still more than twice as much as the cost of a diesel bus today. And that’s not counting the cost of new charging infrastructure or the risk that those charging costs may drive a district’s electric bills through the roof. Highland Electric Transportation says it can remove those barriers for school districts and transit authorities by taking on the financing and management of an EV school bus fleet in exchange for a fixed annual leasing fee. In the past week, the Hamilton, Mass.-based startup has won two votes of confidence in its business model. The first came last week, with the close of a $253 million venture capital investment led by Vision Ridge Partners with participation by previous investors and Fontinalis Partners, the venture fund co-founded by Ford Motor Co. executive chairman Bill Ford.  The second came this week when Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools awarded Highland a contract to supply it with what will be the country’s largest electric school bus fleet. The deal will start with 326 buses to be delivered over the next four years, along with charging systems at five bus depots. The cost of that service, $169 million, will be spread out over 16 years, and will fit into the existing budget structures for its existing diesel bus fleet, said Todd Watkins, the district’s transportation director. After seven years of budget-neutrality, the contract will end up saving the district money compared to what it could have expected to spend on its existing bus fleet, he said. And the district won’t be stuck with the uncertainties of what it will cost to install charging stations, pay for the electricity they use or keep the buses running, because all of that is Highland’s responsibility. While the district did have access to a small amount of upfront electrification funds from the Volkswagen “Dieselgate” settlement, Watkins said he is “not a huge fan of grant-supported pilot programs in any area, because if you can’t sustain it, it’s too risky.” Highland’s contract — which is backed by terms that will protect the district from liability if the company goes out of business — “takes the risks that I think school districts across the country are not so willing to take,” he said. If all goes well, the program could expand to replace all 1,400 of the district’s school buses over the coming decade and a half. “We knew eventually that electric buses would become cheaper than diesels, or at least affordable. But what this deal with Highland did was move that time to now.”Highland’s approach is designed to overcome some major stumbling blocks for public and private fleet owners looking at electrifying their buses, trucks and other vehicles, as documented by multiple studies from groups including the Environmental Defense Fund and RMI.“I would say that the cost and complexity represent the two biggest barriers that have prevented adoption in the past,” said Highland CEO Duncan McIntyre. While many school districts have deployed a handful of electric school buses, moving to a wholesale fleet replacement “in a way that’s aligned with their budget in a relatively unsubsidized environment” is a trickier proposition. Last year’s 130-bus contract between the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and China’s BYD held the record of the country’s biggest electric bus deployment prior to this week. But an earlier, smaller-scale rollout with L.A. Metro, a separate transit entity in Los Angeles County, ran into challenges with driving range and maintenance that required correction before the broader rollout could commence. *McIntyre, who founded renewable energy marketplace startup Altenex and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland with the express purpose of taking on those costs and complexities for school districts. Its first deal, made last March with the city of Beverly, Massachusetts, will deploy 27 electric school buses. Montgomery County’s contract will use the same combination of buses from Thomas Built equipped with batteries from Proterra but at a much larger scale. That brings significantly more risks in terms of managing the costs, but also greater opportunity to improve efficiencies of — and even earn money from — the charging infrastructure involved.  For example, Highland has been working for nine months on plans to equip the five bus depots it’s targeting for charging loads that will eventually grow to 5 megawatts apiece, he said. It ended up prioritizing one depot first, based on the relatively lower cost of connecting it to the existing utility grid infrastructure. The other four depots will be equipped over the next 18 months.Four of those depots are served by utility Pepco, and the fifth is served by Allegheny Power. Each has unique needs in terms of expanding grid infrastructure to support those big new loads. And unlike states such as California, Maryland hasn’t passed regulations to allow utilities to rate-base those investments as “make-ready” infrastructure, putting the onus on Highland to cover those costs, he said. Maryland also hasn’t designed special EV charging rates, which means that Highland will be carefully managing how it charges the buses under existing medium and heavy commercial rate tariffs that include significant demand charges, he said. “We can avoid the vast majority of those demand charges by charging almost entirely off-peak,” mainly during overnight hours, he said. Highland can also shop for competitive electricity suppliers under Maryland’s deregulated energy market structure, he added. Then there’s the opportunity for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) revenue. Maryland is part of the wholesale market structure of mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM, which has been a vanguard in allowing electric vehicles to discharge excess battery power to the grid to serve in its frequency regulation markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2222, passed last year, will require PJM and the country’s other interstate grid operators to expand market access for EVs and other distributed energy resources to their broader energy and capacity markets, “which is really opening the door to giving those assets appropriate value,” he said. Getting enough EVs together to “have enough scale to actually be relevant assets to begin with” is a key step in making the economics of V2G work in Highland’s favor. In some states, utilities are seeking to become the overarching provider of school bus electrification services, with Dominion Energy’s 50-bus pilot being the prime example. But Dominion has yet to win Virginia lawmakers’ approval to expand its program to 1,000 electric school buses by 2025, with competing bills proposing other methods to open the market to non-utility competitors. In North Carolina, utility Duke Energy has launched a fleet EV charging subsidiary after seeing a proposed charging pilot program scaled back by state regulators. McIntyre believes that non-utility actors should be given a chance to compete against utilities’ entrenched market advantage, to ensure that private capital can be deployed at a scale needed to rapidly expand vehicle electrification to meet local, state and federal decarbonization goals. At the same time, he’s supportive of policies that can align utilities’ investments in a way that supports the EV charging build-out that will be needed to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner electricity. Nat Kreamer, CEO of Advanced Energy Economy, highlighted the different roles for utilities and fleet electrification specialists in a world where transportation is expected to become a major new electrical load. “For utilities, electrifying transportation is a huge growth area,” he said, with commensurate support for policies that can “let them do that make-ready [investment] so they can grow that business.” But when it comes to fleet owners, he recommends that firms “just sell the customer what they’re really paying for, which is a mile driven with clean electricity. That ends up being a really powerful business model.” - - - * UPDATE: An earlier version of this story incorrectly conflated an electric bus deployment with the Los Angeles County Department of Transportation with an earlier deployment with county transit agency L.A.

274,Graphene ‘Nano-Origami’ Could Take Us Past the End of Moore’s Law,Nanotech/Materials,https://singularityhub.com/2021/03/01/graphene-nano-origami-could-take-us-past-the-end-of-moores-law/,"Wonder material graphene is often touted as a potential way around the death of Moore’s Law, but harnessing its promising properties has proven tricky. Now, researchers have shown they can build graphene chips 100 times smaller than normal ones using a process they’ve dubbed “nano-origami.”For decades our ability to miniaturize electronic components improved exponentially, and with it the performance of our chips. But in recent years we’ve started approaching the physical limits of the silicon technology we’ve become so reliant on, and progress is slowing.The ability to build ever-faster chips has underpinned the rapid technological advances we’ve made in the last half-century, so understandably people are keen to keep that trend going. As a result, a plethora of new technologies are vying to take us past the end of Moore’s Law, but so far none have taken an obvious lead.One of the most promising candidates is graphene, a form of carbon that comes in one-atom-thick sheets, which are both incredibly strong and have a range of remarkable electronic properties. Despite its potential, efforts to create electronics out of graphene and similar 2D materials have been progressing slowly.One of the reasons is that the processes used to create these incredibly thin layers inevitably introduce defects that can change the properties of the material. Typically, these imperfections are seen as problematic, as any components made this way may not behave as expected.But in a paper published in the journal ACS Nano, researchers from the University of Sussex in the UK decided to investigate exactly how these defects impact the properties of graphene and another 2D material called molybdenum disulfide, and how they could be exploited to design ultra-small microchips.Building on their findings, the team has now shown that they can direct these defects to create minuscule electronic components. By wrinkling a sheet of graphene, they were able to get it to behave like a transistor without adding any additional materials.“We’re mechanically creating kinks in a layer of graphene. It’s a bit like nano-origami,” Alan Dalton, who led the research, said in a press release.“Using these nanomaterials will make our computer chips smaller and faster. It is absolutely critical that this happens as computer manufacturers are now at the limit of what they can do with traditional semiconducting technology.”The work falls into an emerging line of research known as “straintronics,” which is uncovering the surprising ways in which mechanical strains in nanomaterials can dramatically change their electronic, magnetic, and even optical characteristics.Now that the researchers have elucidated how different kinds of defects like wrinkles, domes, and holes impact the properties of these 2D materials, they’re working on ways to precisely pattern them to create more complex chips.According to New Scientist, they have already mastered creating rows of wrinkles using pattern molds and generating domes by firing lasers at water molecules to make them expand, and they hope to have a functional prototype chip within five years.They say that the approach allows them to build processors around 100 times smaller than conventional microchips, which could be thousands of times faster than today’s devices and would require far less energy and resources to make.There’s still a long way to go to flesh out the potential of the approach, but it represents a promising new front in the race to keep the technological juggernaut we’ve created steaming ahead at full power.Image Credit: seagul from PixabayGet the latest news from Singularity Hub!Singularity University, Singularity Hub, Singularity Summit, SU Labs, Singularity Labs, Exponential Medicine, Exponential Finance and all associated logos and design elements are trademarks and/or service marks of Singularity Education Group.© 2021 Singularity Education Group.

275,Top Apple insider sheds light on upcoming iPhone 13 features,,https://bgr.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-rumors-notch-design-features/,"Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo — who historically has a strong record with respect to Apple rumors — recently issued a new investor note (via 9to5Mac) which sheds some light on what type of features we can expect to see on Apple’s next-gen iPhone 13.Corroborating previous rumors, Kuo claims that Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro models will feature a 120HZ ProMotion display, a technology that will enable more fluid scrolling and improved responsiveness. Previous reports have indicated that Apple is planning to incorporate dynamic variable refresh switching which will allow the display to switch between 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rates depending on the use-case.

Incidentally, Kuo does add that upcoming iPhone models in 2022 might see Apple do away with the notch completely and replace it with a punch-hole design similar to what we’ve seen from Samsung devices in recent years.One of the more intriguing iPhone 13 rumors we’ve seen in recent week centers on Apple bringing back Touch ID via an in-screen fingerprint sensor. According to a smattering of reports, Apple has no plans to get rid of Face ID but would rather have Touch ID coexist alongside its facial recognition software. Kuo, however, isn’t entirely confident we’re going to see this somewhat drastic design change this year.The market expects the iPhone to abandon Lightning in favor of USB-C and equip the power button with the Touch ID sensor, but our latest survey indicates that there is no visibility on the current schedule for the iPhone to adopt these two new specifications.We believe that the iPhone will significantly improve the user experience if it adopts the power button with the Touch ID sensor. However, currently, there is no visibility on the timing of adopting this new specification.Kuo adds that Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro models will feature improved camera technologies while the entirety of Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup will benefit from an upgraded 5G modem from Qualcomm.Outside of Kuo’s report, there have been rumblings that Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup will feature a texturized matte back to make the device easier to hold.“The matte back is getting refined,” EverythingApplePro reported last month. “So in the 2021 iPhones, I’m sure Max is referring to the Pro models, they’ll have a slightly more grippy texturized back. He says they’ll be slightly more comfortable and he assumes it’ll be like a soft matte, like on the Pixel series.” There have also been reports that the iPhone 13 will feature an Always-On display that will keep the time, battery life, and incoming notifications visible at all times. And lastly, there are reports that the iPhone 13 will finally introduce support for Portrait Mode video recording.Apple is expected to unveil and release its iPhone 13 lineup this coming September.Today's Top Deal     Sleek black KN95 masks are back in stock at Amazon after selling out twice!

276,"How Siemens Energy Is Targeting the US Green Hydrogen Opportunity: The latest test at the Utah mega-project marks the third U.S. entry into electrolysis, storage and the use of carbon-free fuel.",Business,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-siemens-energy-is-targeting-the-u.s-green-hydrogen-opportunity,"The latest test at the Utah mega-project marks the third U.S. entry into electrolysis, storage and the use of carbon-free fuel.Senior Editor Greentech MediaSiemens Energy's Silyzer electrolyzer is part of a green hydrogen technology line the company is hoping will gain market share in the nascent U.S. market. (Credit: Siemens) Green hydrogen is both an untested and a potentially vital way for renewable-energy-powered grids to store their intermittent power for later use, not just for hours at a time, but for days, weeks or even seasons ahead. Most of the early-stage work on hydrogen’s grid storage potential is happening in Europe and Asia, but the U.S. does have a few projects taking steps toward proving out the concept. Take the Intermountain Power Project, the coal-fired power plant in Utah converting to turbines that will use natural gas blended with 30 percent hydrogen, a proportion that will rise to 100 percent hydrogen over the coming decades. That 840 megawatts of generation capacity, serving customers including California’s Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, could become a source of increasingly low-carbon energy fueled by hydrogen stored in massive underground caverns — if the systems to use renewable energy to convert water to hydrogen via electrolysis and store it for later use can combine in a cost-effective way. On Monday, Siemens Energy announced a U.S. Energy Department grant-funded project to study how its Silyzer electrolyzers could be combined with hydrogen compression, storage and power plant controls technology to meet those goals at Intermountain. It’s the latest of three grants to the energy systems spinoff of the German industrial giant to test its hydrogen technology in the U.S., including a small-scale pilot with Southeast utility Duke Energy and South Carolina’s Clemson University, and another to design, build and test a compressor system to integrate hydrogen into existing fossil fuel generation. Siemens Energy is among global power systems giants such as Mitsubishi Power, General Electric and Wärtsilä designing a new generation of turbines and engines to run on hydrogen. While Mitsubishi won the contract to supply turbines to the Intermountain project, “we have a good shot to create the hydrogen” to fuel them, Richard Voorberg, vice president of global service operations for Siemens Energy, said in a December interview. Siemens Energy is also supplying the steam turbines, alongside GE gas-fired turbines, for a $65 million, 20-megawatt green hydrogen project being built by Florida Power & Light, the utility subsidiary of NextEra Energy, the country’s biggest renewable energy developer, Voorberg said. That project envisions turning excess solar into hydrogen to augment the natural-gas supply for FPL’s 1.75-gigawatt Okeechobee power plant, and it could be online by 2023. Siemens Silyzer technology, meanwhile, is competing with a host of electrolyzer technologies seeking to capitalize on major governmental targets, starting with the European Union’s 2030 target to deploy 40 gigawatts of electrolyzers within its own borders and another 40 GW in neighboring countries. The U.S. lacks a national hydrogen energy strategy like Europe’s, or like South Korea’s plan to have 15 gigawatts of hydrogen-powered fuel cells by 2040 and become the world’s largest fuel cell-powered vehicle maker by decade’s end. But U.S. power plant operators are starting to expand their ambitions. In September, three groups including Intermountain announced their intention to buy about 3,300 megawatts of hydrogen-capable turbines and hydrogen generation and storage systems from Mitsubishi. Utilities facing the challenge of decarbonizing their power systems see green hydrogen as an important addition to batteries to store wind and solar power for use when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. The earliest entrants into the field have access to large underground salt domes now used for storing fossil fuels that could be converted to storing hydrogen, like Intermountain and New Orleand-based utility Entergy. Massive storage capacity is key to the promise of using hydrogen at scales that could allow power plants now burning natural gas to tap the carbon-neutral gas to fire turbines for days or weeks at a time. Today’s lithium-ion battery technologies are limited to about four to eight hours of storage capacity, and overbuilding enough battery capacity to cover longer periods of time would drastically expand costs. That limitation is driving research into longer-duration energy storage, from novel battery chemistries to kinetic or thermal storage systems, that could help replace the need for fueled generation to ensure reliable grid power amid the global push to decarbonize generation. Major U.S. fuel cell makers including Bloom Energy and Plug Power are expanding into electrolyzers to provide the green hydrogen to fuel on-site and distributed electricity generation, as well as to serve carbon-free transportation. But multiple challenges face efforts to use green hydrogen as a long-duration energy storage option. First of all, the efficiency of turning clean electricity into hydrogen, and then burning that hydrogen to generate power, is “somewhere in the 40 to 50 percent level,” Voorberg said. “That becomes pretty expensive,” he said. “One of the challenges we’ve got is how to increase the efficiencies,” whether through reducing the cost of clean power and electrolysis systems or by capturing additional uses for the energy outputs involved. Siemens Energy’s project with Duke and Clemson, for example, is testing the value of capturing excess heat from a 15-megawatt turbine to supply the university campus district heat system, he said. It’s also examining the value of generating and storing hydrogen on-site, to allow the campus grid to maintain low-carbon power production amid larger grid failures. Whether or not the economics of using excess renewable energy to generate hydrogen can pencil out may well depend on how market structures are developed to integrate it. Using only excess wind and solar power to generate hydrogen may underutilize the capital costs of the electrolyzer, storage and transport infrastructure needed to put it to use. But the resulting stored energy could also reliably provide power for rare but critical gaps in renewable power supply, putting the onus on policymakers and energy regulators to create structures that can support it, Michael Liebreich, CEO of Liebreich Associates and the founder of BloombergNEF, wrote in an October blog post. Duke Energy, one of a growing number of major U.S. utilities pledging zero-carbon emissions by 2050, is looking for opportunities to test the reliability and economics of hydrogen-powered turbines as one of the “emerging technologies” it will rely on to reach its goal, Voorberg said. Converting the nation’s natural-gas power plant fleet to a fuel that’s only being produced at a minuscule scale today will require “a scale-up of epic proportions,” he said. “This is a market that will dynamically change. None of us know quite what it will look like.” Follow us!"

Google is warning that bots are causing more problems for business – but many companies are only focused on the most obvious attacks. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic Microsoft chief Satya Nadella said Microsoft had seen ""two years' worth of digital transformation in two months."" Google now sees that attackers have adapted to these changed conditions and are boosting attacks on newly online businesses, with bots high on the list of tools used.  Bot attacks can cover anything from web scraping where bots are used to gather content or data, to bots that try to beat Captchas, to ad fraud, card fraud and inventory fraud. Of particular concern are distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), where junk traffic is directed at an online service with the purpose of flooding it to the point of knocking it offline.  According to the advertising giant, 71% of companies experienced an increase in the number of successful bot attacks, and 56% of companies reported seeing different types of attacks, but it said many companies are using the wrong mix of technology to protect themselves. SEE: Kubernetes security guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)Google's research has found that while 78% of organizations are using DDoS protection, such as web application firewalls, and content distribution networks (CDN), less than a fifth of them are using a ""full bot management system"".  ""Bots attack an application's business logic, and only a bot management solution can protect against that sort of threat,"" says Google cloud platform's Kelly Anderson, a product marketing manager.  ""To effectively safeguard web applications from bot attacks, organizations must use tools like DDoS protection, WAF, and/or CDNs, alongside a bot management solution."" According to Anderson, there's a missing link between application security and security operations teams and e-commerce, fraud, and network security pros, which allows for bots to pose a threat to business operations.  ""Effective bot management relies on collaboration between many teams within an organization, including security, customer experience, e-commerce, and marketing. But on average, only two teams are involved in bot management, usually the application security and security operations teams. Yet, it's the e-commerce, fraud, and network security professionals that most commonly consume the data from bot management tools. This disconnect can lead to the commerce or fraud teams being left out of critical bot management decisions,"" she explains.  Because of this disconnection between security and anti-fraud teams, firms spend 53 working days – or nearly two months – across roles resolving attacks. Anderson wants businesses to invest in a bot management system that can detect the most sophisticated bots.  ""Good automated traffic comes from approved partner applications and search engines, while bad traffic comes from malicious bot activity. Bots account for over half of all automated web traffic and nearly a quarter of all internet traffic in 2019, leaving professionals to thread the needle,"" Google says in a research paper.  SEE: Cybercrime groups are selling their hacking skills. Some countries are buyingGoogle commissioned the research to analyst firm Forrester Consulting, which looked at bot management approaches. The survey gained 425 respondents with responsibilities over fraud management, attack detection and response, and the protection of user data. The company found that most organizations are only protecting themselves on card fraud, ad fraud, and influence fraud attacks.  ""Only 15% of businesses are currently protecting themselves against web scraping attacks, yet 73% face such an attack on a weekly basis,"" Forrester Consulting says.  Almost two-thirds of respondents said they lost between 1% and 10% of revenue to web scraping attacks alone.  ""Many businesses focus on the types of attacks that are mostly commonly in the news, rather than the attacks that can cause the most damage to their bottom lines,"" the consulting firm says.

278,Recipeasly: Food website removed after blogger backlash,Business,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56241653,"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporterA website that collates recipes from the internet has been taken down hours after it launched, following a backlash from food bloggers.Recipeasly said it wanted to ""fix online recipes"" by removing ""ads and life stories"" when users imported external links.But content creators criticised the platform for breaching copyright and accused it of ""stealing"" revenue.The website was removed after a deluge of complaints on social media.“We're sorry,” a message on the homepage reads.Some personal news! ✨ Two friends and I created a new thing to fix online recipes 😄https://t.co/3ZNkSV82Y5 - your favourite recipes except without the ads or life stories 🍩Feedback and RTs appreciated! 🙏 pic.twitter.com/WerUH34AGG""We have nothing but respect and admiration for the time, money and effort that go into creating great recipes & websites. We don't want to minimise the results for all that hard work.""We realise we're not demonstrating the huge respect we have for recipe creators. We missed the mark big time today and we're sorry.""The website says its aim is to remove “ads, clutter and long pages of content (designed for the search engine rather than humans)”.A lot of food blogs contain text before the recipe, often writing about a personal connection to the meal or the history behind it.Many people responding to Recipeasly's launch on social media said it was a useful tool.“Please don’t bow to the criticism, this site is an answer to my prayers,” one tweet said.“We all hate shifting through lifestyle guru stuff to see if we need one egg or two,” another wrote.However, food bloggers have complained that the stories accompanying recipes are relevant.Binny Shah-Patel, food writer and creator of Binny's Food and Travel blog, said it took the “heart and soul” out of recipes.“If I shared a recipe that was inspired by something my grandmother fondly made for me growing up in Kenya, it is now one of the ways I remember my grandmother now that she has passed away, and I can't even go home because of Covid.“I would want others to know about the inspiration behind the recipe and what it means to me every time I make it and eat it, so that they too can appreciate it that much more and perhaps learn a little about my background and grandmother in the process.”Critics said the website was taking advertising revenue away from predominately female creators.“As recipe development is one of the major services I offer, these platforms present a real threat to my income as they could be seen to undermine my work,” Kacie Morgan, food blogger at The Rare Welsh Bit, said.Money made from advertising on her blog was largely dependent on the number of people visiting the site each month, she added.“Ads help me have a job that I can work around my condition and being a mum,” Jenna Farmer, who blogs about her experience with Crohn's disease, said.“They're a way of supporting a blogger whose recipes you love, without having to spend a penny on a recipe book in the traditional way.""A post shared by Jenna Farmer- A Balanced Belly (@jennafarmeruk)Tom Redman, one of the creators of the platform, emphasised that Recipeasly had no revenue or profit, and that it drove blog traffic through links on the platform.Recipes on the website were only visible to the user who imported them, “similar to if a user had printed the recipe or copied it into a [document]”, he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter.“Given the feedback, we are taking recipeasly.com down as we re-examine our impact on the community,” he added.Recipes scraped off a website and republished without consent could be a breach of copyright, Mark Blunden, head of technology at law firm Boyes Turner, said.“If someone has created a recipe and put it into writing, then like any other literary work it will automatically attract copyright protection.“Images are also the copyright of the creator, and reproducing them online without consent is a copyright infringement.“However, if someone were to adapt an existing recipe and change it sufficiently, it will be a fresh copyright work and non-infringing.""He suggested creators could use watermarks or back up their text in a repository, to help protect their work.The BBC has contacted Recipeasly for comment.'Everything's cancelled': Influencers and Covid-19EU's controversial copyright plan rejectedYouTube adds more ads but won't pay everyone'Love Island star transformed my business'Myanmar asks India to return police who fled coupSeveral officers reportedly crossed the border after refusing to carry out the military junta's orders.US Senate passes $1.9tn Covid-19 relief planIn pictures: Mardi Gras marches on in SydneyThe young rebels risking their lives for the futureThe women saving India's intricate flower embroidery.

279,Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery,Networking/Telecom,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery,"Filed under:This, despite the carrier’s relentless promotion of its 5G networkDespite its relentless promotion of 5G phones and the fact that it spent more than $45 billion bidding on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. In a Sunday morning tweet, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones), but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed,” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS, which in many instances is actually slower than the LTE network it’s trying to replace.Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month, after formally launching its next-gen network in October 2020.  One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage, which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.

A SolarWinds third-party, public relations spokesperson, however, claims that the password incident had nothing to do with the major security breach.

We still don't know just how bad the SolarWinds security breach is. We do know over a hundred US government agencies and companies were cracked. Microsoft president Brad Smith said, with no exaggeration, that it's ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen,"" with more than a thousand hackers behind it. But former SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson says it may have all started when an intern first set an important password to ""'solarwinds123."" Then, adding insult to injury, the intern shared the password on GitHub.You can't make this stuff up.A Goldin Solutions representative, a crisis-response PR firm, now claims, however, that SolarWinds has ""determined that the credentials using that password were for a third-party vendor application and not for access to the SolarWinds IT systems."" Indeed, the spokesperson claims that the application didn't even connect with the SolarWinds IT systems. Therefore, the credentials using this password had nothing to do with the SUNBURST attack or other breaches of the company's IT systems.  That's not the impression SolarWinds' brass gave Congress earlier. Also: Best password manager in 2021Thompson told a joint US House of Representatives Oversight and Homeland Security Committees hearing that the password was ""a mistake that an intern made. They violated our password policies and they posted that password on an internal, on their own private Github account. As soon as it was identified and brought to the attention of my security team, they took that down.""Representative Katie Porter, Democrat from California, rejoined, ""I've got a stronger password than 'solarwinds123' to stop my kids from watching too much YouTube on their iPad.""How long did it actually take SolarWinds to replace the lousy password? Too long. While SolarWinds executives said it was fixed within days of its discovery, current SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna confessed that the password had been in use by 2017. Vinoth Kumar, the security researcher who discovered the leaked password had said SolarWinds didn't fix the issue until November 2019. Almost two years is too long to leave an important password to go stale. You also have to wonder what an intern was doing setting a significant password in the first place.  While SolarWinds isn't sure that this password is the hole in the dyke that Russian hackers used to flood into American systems, it's a safe bet that a security culture that enabled such a basic mistake couldn't have helped.Also: Better than the best password: How to use 2FA to improve your securityLooking ahead, Smith suggested to the US Senate that in the future the Federal government should impose a ""notification obligation on entities in the private sector."" All too often no one knows about corporate security breaches until they've blown up the way SolarWinds' failure did. Smith agreed that isn't ""a typical step when somebody comes and says, 'Place a new law on me,'"" but ""I think it's the only way we are going to protect the country.""   In the meantime, as security company FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said at the House hearing, ""The bottom line: We may never know the full range and extent of the damage, and we may never know the full range and extent as to how the stolen information is benefiting an adversary.""That said, Mandia added, ""I'm not convinced compliance in any standards regulation or legislation would stop Russian Foreign Intelligence Service from successfully breaching the organization."" Related Stories:

283,Far-Right Platform Gab Has Been Hacked—Including Private Data,Security,https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Andy GreenbergTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.When Twitter banned Donald Trump and a slew of other far-right users  in January, many of them became digital refugees, migrating to sites like Parler and Gab to find a home that wouldn't moderate their hate speech and disinformation. Days later, Parler was hacked, and then it was dropped by Amazon web hosting, knocking the site offline. Now Gab, which inherited some of Parler's displaced users, has been badly hacked too. An enormous trove of its contents has been stolen—including what appears to be passwords and private communications.On Sunday night the WikiLeaks-style group Distributed Denial of Secrets is revealing what it calls GabLeaks, a collection of more than 70 gigabytes of Gab data representing more than 40 million posts. DDoSecrets says a hacktivist who self-identifies as ""JaXpArO and My Little Anonymous Revival Project"" siphoned that data out of Gab's backend databases in an effort to expose the platform's largely right-wing users. Those Gab patrons, whose numbers have swelled after Parler went offline, include large numbers of Qanon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, and promoters of former president Donald Trump's election-stealing conspiracies that resulted in the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill.DDoSecrets cofounder Emma Best says that the hacked data includes not only all of Gab's public posts and profiles—with the exception of any photos or videos uploaded to the site—but also private group and private individual account posts and messages, as well as user passwords and group passwords. ""It contains pretty much everything on Gab, including user data and private posts, everything someone needs to run a nearly complete analysis on Gab users and content,"" Best wrote in a text message interview with WIRED. ""It's another gold mine of research for people looking at militias, neo-Nazis, the far right, QAnon, and everything surrounding January 6.""DDoSecrets says it's not publicly releasing the data due to its sensitivity and the vast amounts of private information it contains. Instead the group says it will selectively share it with journalists, social scientists, and researchers. WIRED viewed a sample of the data, and it does appear to contain Gab users' individual and group profiles—their descriptions and privacy settings—public and private posts, and passwords. Gab CEO Andrew Torba acknowledged the breach in a brief statement Sunday.Passwords for private groups are unencrypted, which Torba says the platform discloses to users when they create one. Individual user account passwords appear to be cryptographically hashed—a safeguard that may help prevent them from being compromised—but the level of security depends on the hashing scheme used and the strength of the underlying password.Among the users whose hashed passwords appeared to be included in the data were those for Donald Trump, Republican congresswoman and QAnon-conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, MyPillow CEO and election-conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell, and disinformation-spouting radio host Alex Jones. The hacked data also includes a chatlogs.txt file that appears to contain private conversations between the site's users. That file's contents begin with an added note from JaXpArO: ""FUCK TRUMP. FUCK COLONIZERS & CAPITALISTS. DEATH TO AMERIKKKA.""According to DDoSecrets' Best, the hacker says that they pulled out Gab's data via a SQL injection vulnerability in the site—a common web bug in which a text field on a site doesn't differentiate between a user's input and commands in the site's code, allowing a hacker to reach in and meddle with its backend SQL database. Despite the hacker's reference to an ""Anonymous Revival Project,"" they're not associated with the loose hacker collective Anonymous, they told Best, but do ""want to represent the nameless struggling masses against capitalists and fascists.""WIRED reached out to Gab for comment Friday, offering to share what we'd learned about the nature of the site's data breach. The company's CEO, Andrew Torba, responded in a public statement on the company's blog that ""reporters, who write for a publication that has written many hit pieces on Gab in the past, are in direct contact with the hacker and are essentially assisting the hacker in his efforts to smear our business and hurt you, our users."" (WIRED has had no direct contact with the hackers, to our knowledge, only DDoSecrets.)“It's another gold mine of research for people looking at militias, neo-Nazis, the far right, QAnon and everything surrounding January 6.”Emma Best, DDoSecretsResponding to WIRED's mention of a SQL injection vulnerability, Torba's initial statement noted that “we were aware of a vulnerability in this area and patched it last week. We are also proceeding to undertake a full security audit.” The post went on to state that Gab doesn't collect personally identifiable information from its users such as telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates, or health and financial information. “DMs were only live for a few weeks and are not currently a feature supported by the site, so if a breach has in fact occurred in that domain we expect the number of affected accounts to be low,” Torba added. “As we learn more about this alleged breach, we will notify the community publicly with our findings as required by law.”Torba did not confirm that a security breach had occurred in his Friday statement. But in a follow-up on Sunday, Torba used a transphobic slur to insult the hackers ""attacking"" the site and added that both his and Donald Trump's accounts had been ""compromised."" (DDoSecrets was careful to note to WIRED that it has not attempted to crack any of the hashed passwords or tested any of the plaintext passwords in the hacked data. WIRED hasn't either.) “The entire company is all hands investigating what happened and working to trace and patch the problem,” Torba wrote Sunday.Gab is the second far-right social media site to be deeply hacked in as many months. Following the Capitol Hill riot in January, other hacktivists used a simple security flaw in the bustling social media site Parler to download all of its public contents, including the location data embedded in every photo and video Parler users had posted. That Parler data, which placed several users at Capitol Hill on January 6, was preserved by the Internet Archive and also made available by DDoSecrets.When Amazon booted Parler from its hosting service in January, many of the site's users flocked to Gab. But until now, hacktivists have had a hard time downloading public Gab posts as they did with Parler, says Max Aliapoulios, a graduate researcher at the New York University Center for Cybersecurity, with whom DDoSecrets has shared a copy of the hacked Gab data. Due mostly to Gab's instability and frequent downtime, Aliapoulios found that he couldn't easily use an automated tool to scrape the site.Aliapoulios, cocreator of the Social Media Analysis Toolkit, a project that analyzes online communities, argues that the leak of non-private data from Gab will serve a public interest. ""This is all of Gab, and we didn't have to even run a crawler to get it,"" Aliapoulios says.The data, he says, could offer a window into how users migrate from one service to another when facing bans or deplatforming and could even serve to help build tools to keep Gab's hate speech and disinformation from spreading to other sites. ""There's so much hate, harassment, racism, neo-Nazism that occurs on a site like that,"" Aliapoulios says, ""that having a record of that could help develop ways to automatically detect that type of content so that other places that don't allow it can remove it.""The Gab hack is just the latest in a recent string of apparent ""hacktivist"" breaches, many of which have ended with DDoSecrets publishing reams of stolen data, or making it privately available to journalists and researchers. DDoSecrets has also recently released hundreds of gigabytes of information a hacker took from corporations in Myanmar following the military coup there earlier this month. Over the summer, DDoSecrets rose to prominence with a massive leak of law enforcement data stolen by a hacker associated with Anonymous, which DDoSecrets dubbed BlueLeaks. And last month it controversially began publishing collections of corporate data stolen and leaked by ransomware hackers after their victims refused to to pay.Compared with those ransomware leaks, DDoSecrets' decision to only privately share Gab's data may represent a lighter touch. DDoSecrets' Best argues that this approach minimizes the violation of innocent Gab users' privacy. ""Journalists and researchers aren't going to be doing deep dives into people who only post about their kids' ballet recital and pictures of their pets,"" Best writes.But given that other parts of the leak may go well beyond those personal details—and even offer insights into the January 6 Capitol riot, Best argues that Gab's data deserves scrutiny. ""In a simpler or more ordinary time, it'd be an important sociological resource,"" Best writes. ""In 2021, it's also a record of the culture and the exact statements surrounding not only an increase in extremist views and actions, but an attempted coup.""WIRED is where tomorrow is realized. It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation.

284,Europeans get 'right to repair' for some electrical goods,Hardware,https://apnews.com/article/technology-europe-environment-berlin-europe-65168395d1fc7dc0e22792722c93140d,"BERLIN (AP) — Companies that sell refrigerators, washers, hairdryers or TVs in the European Union will need to ensure those appliances can be repaired for up to 10 years, to help reduce the vast mountain of electrical waste that piles up each year on the continent.The “right to repair,” as it is sometimes called, comes into force across the 27-nation bloc Monday. It is part of a broader effort to cut the environmental footprint of manufactured goods by making them more durable and energy efficient. “This is a really big step in the right direction” said Daniel Affelt of the environmental group BUND-Berlin, which runs several “repair cafes” where people can bring in their broken appliances and get help fixing them up again.Modern appliances are often glued or riveted together, he said. “If you need specialist tools or have to break open the device, then you can’t repair it.”Lack of spare parts is another problem, campaigners say. Sometimes a single broken tooth on a tiny plastic sprocket can throw a proverbial wrench in the works.“People want to repair their appliances,” Affelt said. “When you tell them that there are no spare parts for a device that’s only a couple of years old then they are obviously really frustrated by that.”Under the new EU rules, manufacturers will have to ensure parts are available for up to a decade, though some will only be provided to professional repair companies to ensure they are installed correctly.New devices will also have to come with repair manuals and be made in such a way that they can be dismantled using conventional tools when they really can’t be fixed anymore, to improve recycling.Each year, Europeans produce more than 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of electrical waste per person. About half of that junk is due to broken household appliances, and the EU recycles only about 40% of it, leaving behind huge amounts of potentially hazardous material.German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that in a next step, manufacturers should have to state how long a product is expected to work for and repair it if it breaks down earlier. This would encourage companies to build more durable products, she said.“In the repair cafes we see a lot of devices that broke shortly after the warranty expired,” said Affelt — a phenomenon that has prompted some environmentalists to accuse manufacturers of designing their devices with planned obsolescence. Knowing an appliance will really last for a decade might prompt consumers to choose products that are more durable or can be easily fixed, he said.“For the vast majority of devices, repair is the right choice,” said Affelt, adding that the exception might be old, inefficient refrigerators that can contain powerful greenhouse gases which fuel climate change.In a next step, environmentalists and consumer rights groups want the “right to repair” expanded to include smartphones, laptops and other small electrical devices.Responding to growing demand, Apple last year announced it would start providing training and spare parts to certified independent repair stores fixing Mac computers, not just iPhones.Right to repair bills have been introduced in several U.S. state legislatures, attracting bipartisan support, though as yet there is no nationwide measure in force.Sweden has gone further than most of the EU, making repairs and spare parts subject to lower value-added tax.The bloc’s ecological design directive — of which the right to repair requirement is a part — will also revise existing energy labels that describe how much electricity washers and other household devices consume. The new seven-step scale from A to G will be complemented by a QR code that provides consumers with further information, such as how loud the devices are."
285,Private dollars are seeding surveillance tech across the US,Privacy,https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/private-dollars-are-seeding-surveillance-tech-across-the-us/594615/,"A number of local police departments are procuring surveillance tech with the help of donations from private sponsors — and from the tech firms themselves.Editor's Note: The following is an excerpt from Episode 2 of City Surveillance Watch, a limited podcast series from Smart Cities Dive. Follow along with the audio below, beginning at 40:45.The Kansas City, MO Police Department (KCPD) has used license plate readers since 2010, installing them in locations throughout the city and on police vehicles. Like other law enforcement agencies, they publicize when tech investments pay off by helping to solve crime. KCPD detectives even made a video discussing how surveillance camera footage was used in conjunction with data from the city’s license plate readers to identify a 2019 murder suspect.It’s worth noting that video touting the police department’s tech use was produced for the Police Foundation of Kansas City — a nonprofit that helps the Kansas City Missouri Police Department purchase technology. The foundation has provided drones to KCPD, along with other tech like video analytics software and license plate readers. The foundation’s website lists sponsors including local bank and real estate firms and other charities.Police foundations across the country help law enforcement pay for a variety of surveillance tech including drones, which are becoming common tools for aerial surveillance. Take Chula Vista, CA: The police department there in 2019 praised the Chula Vista Police Foundation for purchasing two new drones to add to its collection. The department’s website says they use drones as first responders to document crime and accident scenes, search for missing or wanted persons, or to evaluate fires or damage after major incidents or natural disasters. But it’s worth checking out where the Chula Vista Police Foundation’s money comes from. The foundation’s sponsors page lists a handful of local real estate companies, local dental and medical healthcare providers — that sort of thing.But you’ll also find some of the biggest names in surveillance tech. Motorola is listed in the foundation’s Lieutenant’s Circle. Companies including Axon – which makes tasers, cameras and drones, and Verizon – which provides video surveillance technologies and 5G connectivity services – they’re in the Chula Vista Police Foundation’s Captain’s Circle of sponsors.You might think of this as another way for surveillance tech firms to promote their products in the law enforcement industry, and even help buy their products. These companies support police foundations across the U.S. According to the investigative nonprofit, Little Sis, Amazon, Microsoft and Motorola partner and donate to the Seattle Police Foundation. Motorola also donates to police foundations in Washington, DC, Chicago and Detroit. Verizon has supported foundations in Chicago and New York.So, yeah — private dollars are seeding surveillance tech all over the country.Let’s head to San Francisco, where there’s another growing privately-funded camera network. This one is supported through funding from a tech entrepreneur named Chris Larsen. He’s spent millions of dollars to buy high-definition cameras stationed throughout the city, along with the equipment used to monitor those cameras.And there’s no affiliation with local law enforcement in this case. Larsen told the New York Times in July that the “winning formula” for trust between the community and law enforcement is complete community-wide camera coverage controlled by citizens.But the public safety surveillance tech trend lies in public-private partnerships. And companies like Motorola – which supplies tech for that San Francisco project and for the Real Time Crime Center in New Orleans –  they see opportunity in that public-private trend.Motorola in July introduced a video security and analytics technology suite designed specifically for public-private partnership programs. It includes new license plate recognition camera tech that can link up into police monitoring centers through the cloud.The company did not respond to multiple requests to comment for the City Surveillance Watch podcast. Motorola could be making a smart bet. Whether we’re talking about programs funded by police foundations that benefit corporate interests, or funded by local businesses picking up the tech tab, we could see more privately-funded anti-crime tech interventions like Project Green Light in Detroit, Safecam in New Orleans, or rogue efforts like what’s happening in San Francisco.Think about it: city coffers have run dry amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, residents are pushing for cities to defund the police. It’s worth pondering whether these forces will inspire more public-private partnerships or privately funded tech to fill in the gaps where there’s no longer government funding or resources.If that happens, some argue these private approaches will push tech decision-making that was once subject to government accountability and oversight further into the shadows — where they are not always subject to legislation or policy crafted by and voted on by elected officials; where they aren’t always subject to technology impact reviews or community comment periods; and where they are not always subject to standard government oversight, transparency and accountability.Hungry for more?

286,Google's predictive 'Smart Compose' is coming to chat apps in Pixel phones,Software,https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-update-smart-compose-recorder-share-underwater-camera-180046621.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618,"Google kicked off a cycle of updates that started around the time it dropped the first Android 12 developer preview last week. Since then, it announced a bunch of new features for Android devices, and today it's sharing a few more improvements coming to Pixel phones. These features appear to be rolling out now, and include tweaks to the Recorder app, an underwater upgrade for photography and Smart Compose coming to more apps.Google's powerful Recorder app launched as a rival to Otter.ai in 2019 and had some notable differences. Unlike Otter, the Recorder app used on-device machine learning to transcribe your interviews, so your sensitive information isn't transmitted anywhere unless you decide to share it. But Otter had a more powerful online editor that allowed you to edit your transcripts more easily, which is a blessing since neither service is still perfect at interpreting what you or your interviewees said.Now, Google is launching a new site at recorder.google.com and is making it easier to share your audio files with their transcripts so people without Pixels can also read and listen. Recorder has the potential to be a great tool for accessibility, since you can use it to record snippets of audio and generate an animated transcript to share as an MP4. But the usefulness of that feature relies heavily on the accuracy of the transcription, and having a new portal and way to share these clips could make this tool more inclusive.Google's Smart Compose tool initially showed up to suggest ways to complete our messages in Gmail and Docs, and it's now expanding to chat apps. Through GBoard, the feature will be available on Android Messages, Google Chat / Hangouts, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Verizon Messages, Line, Telegram and Slack. When you have Smart Compose enabled and start typing in one of these apps, you'll see suggestions for how to complete your message based on what Google's machine learning determined is appropriate or common.

287,How a 10-second video clip sold for $6.6 million,Society,https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Elizabeth Howcroft, Ritvik Carvalho7 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - In October 2020, Miami-based art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent almost $67,000 on a 10-second video artwork that he could have watched for free online. Last week, he sold it for $6.6 million.The video by digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was authenticated by blockchain, which serves as a digital signature to certify who owns it and that it is the original work.It’s a new type of digital asset - known as a non-fungible token (NFT) - that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scramble to spend enormous sums of money on items that only exist online.Blockchain technology allows the items to be publicly authenticated as one-of-a-kind, unlike traditional online objects which can be endlessly reproduced.“You can go in the Louvre and take a picture of the Mona Lisa and you can have it there, but it doesn’t have any value because it doesn’t have the provenance or the history of the work,” said Rodriguez-Fraile, who said he first bought Beeple’s piece because of his knowledge of the U.S.-based artist’s work.“The reality here is that this is very, very valuable because of who is behind it.”“Non-fungible” refers to items that cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis, as each one is unique - in contrast to “fungible” assets like dollars, stocks or bars of gold.Examples of NFTs range from digital artworks and sports cards to pieces of land in virtual environments or exclusive use of a cryptocurrency wallet name, akin to the scramble for domain names in the early days of the internet.The computer-generated video sold by Rodriguez-Fraile shows what appears to be a giant Donald Trump collapsed on the ground, his body covered in slogans, in an otherwise idyllic setting.OpenSea, a marketplace for NFTs, said it has seen monthly sales volume grow to $86.3 million so far in February, as of Friday, from $8 million in January, citing blockchain data. Monthly sales were at $1.5 million a year ago.“If you spend 10 hours a day on the computer, or eight hours a day in the digital realm, then art in the digital realm makes tonnes of sense - because it is the world,” said OpenSea’s co-founder Alex Atallah.Investors caution, however, that while big money is flowing into NFTs, the market could represent a price bubble.Like many new niche investment areas, there is the risk of major losses if the hype dies down, while there could be prime opportunities for fraudsters in a market where many participants operate under pseudonyms.(Graphic: Crypto asset sales surge, )CHRISTIE’S ‘EMBRACES TERRIFYING’Nonetheless, auction house Christie’s has just launched its first-ever sale of digital art – a collage of 5,000 pictures, also by Beeple – which exists solely as an NFT.Bids for the work have hit $3 million, with the sale due to close on March 11.“We are in a very unknown territory. In the first 10 minutes of bidding we had more than a hundred bids from 21 bidders and we were at a million dollars,” said Noah Davis, specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s.His division has never seen an online-only sale top $1 million before, he added.In a decision that could help push cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream, the auction house that was founded in 1766 will accept payment in the digital coin Ether as well as traditional money.“I think that this moment was inevitable and whenever institutions of any kind try to resist inevitability, it does not work out very well,” Davis said of accepting crypto payment. “And so the best thing you can do is embrace the terrifying.”NFTs could be benefiting from the hype around cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as well as virtual reality’s potential to create online worlds. The growing interest also coincides with a surge in online retail trading during lockdowns.The start of the rush for NFTs has been linked with the launch of the U.S. National Basketball Association’s Top Shot website, which allows users to buy and trade NFTs in the form of video highlights of games.Five months after its launch, the platform says it has over 100,000 buyers and nearly $250 million in sales. The majority of sales take place in the site’s peer-to-peer marketplace, with the NBA getting a royalty on every sale.The volume is rapidly rising: February has seen sales totalling $198 million as of Friday, heading for a fivefold increase from January’s $44 million, Top Shot said.Each collectible has “a unique serial number with guaranteed scarcity and protected ownership guaranteed by blockchain”, the site says. “When you own #23/49 of a legendary LeBron James dunk, you’re the only person in the world who does.”The biggest transaction to date was on Feb. 22, when a user paid $208,000 for a video of a LeBron James slam dunk.One major NFT enthusiast, who goes by the pseudonym “Pranksy” told Reuters he had invested $600 in an early NFT project in 2017 and has now built that up to a portfolio “worth seven figures” in NFTs and cryptocurrencies. He asked to be anonymous to protect his family’s privacy.Pranksy said he has now spent more than $1 million on Top Shot and made about $4.7 million by reselling purchases. Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures, although NBA Top Shot confirmed he is among the site’s biggest buyers.“I see them as investments really, much like any other collectibles and NFTs that currently exist,” he said in an interview conducted via Twitter. “I’d never watched a game of basketball before Top Shot launched.”‘EMERGENCE OF THE METAVERSE’Nate Hart, a Nashville-based NFT investor who, like Pranksy, has been involved in the market since it first developed in 2017, has seen some popular digital art NFTs such as Autoglyphs and CryptoPunk surge in value.Hart said he bought a LeBron James Cosmic NFT on NBA Top Shot for $40,000 in January, then sold it for $125,000 in February.“We’re in awe, it just doesn’t feel real. We were in the right place, right time, got lucky, but we also took that risk,” he said.“The space has been growing a lot. I do think that this is a little bit of a bubble. It is a bubble,” he said. “It’s hard to predict what the top will be.”Andrew Steinwold, who launched a $6 million dollar NFT investment fund in January, warned that the majority of NFTs could become worthless in future.But, like many backers, he is confident that some items will retain their value and that NFTs represent the future of digital ownership, paving the way for a world in which people live, socialise and make money in virtual environments.“We’re spending a lot of our time digitally, always online, always plugged in. It makes sense to now add property rights to the mix and suddenly we have the emergence of the metaverse,” he said.“I think it’s going to reach into the trillions of dollars one day.”Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Pravin CharOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

290,"Thanks to US laws, sex workers are fighting to stay online",Business,https://www.cnet.com/features/thanks-to-us-laws-sex-workers-are-fighting-to-stay-online/,"
            In 2021 escorts aren't just fighting against the stigma of sex work, they're fighting for their right to be on the internet.
          Editors' note: This story contains sexually explicit language and descriptions not suited for younger readers. 	 	 	 	In August, sex worker Lucie Bee was having serious issues with her OnlyFans account. First the site slowed to a crawl, then she couldn't log on.     Almost immediately, she freaked out.     Click for more on the intersection of sex and technology.A 30-year-old, high-profile escort with over 40,000 followers on Twitter, Bee sometimes incorporates cosplay into her sex work, once sewing a costume from scratch when she couldn't find just the right one to please a client. Living in Australia, Bee works as an escort, but around $2,000 of her monthly earnings come from $10 fees and tips from paid followers on OnlyFans, a subscription-based social media platform that lets creators sell their original content -- photos, videos -- as well as host one-on-one interactions.  And Bee thought she was going to lose her OnlyFans income. All of it. Because when she was logged out of her account, she leaped to what she believed was the most obvious conclusion: She'd become the latest escort to be banned from the site.    To blame for Bee's tenuous position? FOSTA-SESTA, a one-two punch of bills signed into law in 2018 in Washington DC, 9,500 miles away. Until these laws change, escorts like Lucie Bee are entirely at their mercy.  Sex work is banned in every US state outside of Nevada, but if you are an escort in Australia -- where Bee works legally --  your online presence is bound by stringent US laws giving authorities the power to shut down any website that advertises escort services. In 2021, sites like OnlyFans, Twitter and Instagram will quickly remove any accounts for even the barest mention of escorting, without explanation.    These deletions pose a major problem for workers like Bee, who risks potential financial ruin as a result of escort work, which, where she lives, is perfectly legal and above board.  ""At any moment, it can all be taken away,"" Bee says.     Granting federal authorities in the US the broad power to shut down any website where escort services are advertised, FOSTA-SESTA is a bill designed to curb sex trafficking on sites like Backstage. Despite good intentions, the bill's passing inspired broad debate online. The Electronic Frontier Foundation claimed it would ""silence online speech,"" calling it a ""dark day for the internet.""    Lucie Bee lives in fear of losing her OnlyFans accounts, and accounts on other platforms like Twitter and Instagram.But supporters of the bill, including Marian Hatcher -- a victim advocate and policy analyst -- believe freedom of speech is low on the priority list. ""Our primary objective must be to end exploitation and prevent the harm that is inherent to those in the sex trade,"" she said in an interview with Feminist Current.     Yet the mistake, escorts claim, is assuming all sex workers are being exploited.     Some embrace the profession out of hardship, but many find the work empowering. Above all, sex work is work. FOSTA-SESTA is designed to protect victims involved in nonconsensual trafficking, but overlooks those like Bee involved in consensual, legal sex work.    Bee wishes more people understood exactly how escorting works. Sex work isn't always about sex, she says. She's built a community of clients who will regularly tune in to watch her livestream video games on Twitch. ""The guys all talk to each other,"" she laughs.    ""The thing I wish people got about sex work is that sometimes it can be incredibly boring,"" Bee says. ""But sometimes it can be sweet.""    But sex work can also be dangerous. Some -- like Alexandra Yelderman, from the DC-based Human Trafficking Legal Center -- believe FOSTA-SESTA works against sex workers' safety. Removing online advertising of sex work services, Yelderman says, makes it incredibly difficult for law enforcement to track and recover potential victims of trafficking.    FOSTA-SESTA's passing had a dramatic impact on the internet. Major platforms have been running scared. Tumblr was perhaps the most high-profile casualty. Tumblr removed all pornography in December 2018 -- most believe in response to FOSTA-SESTA. As a result, its audience went into terminal decline and never really recovered.    But sex workers took the biggest hit.    In 2021, escorts aren't just fighting against the stigma of sex work. They're fighting for their right to be online.    ""FOSTA-SESTA fucked the entire industry,"" says Jenna Love. Love is an escort working out of the Blue Mountains in Australia who creates and sells her own pornography.    ""You go to log in one day and you can't. That's it. You don't get told why. In Australia, we're working legally. We pay a lot of taxes.""    But that doesn't matter, says Love. Because sites like OnlyFans are hosted in the US, they are subject to its laws.     In a statement, OnlyFans confirmed that promotion of escort services is against its terms of service and that ""immediate action"" could be taken against accounts that advertise escort services. Emily van der Nagel, who co-wrote the book Sex and Social Media with Katrin Tiidenberg, calls the process the ""deplatformization of sex.""  ""The way sex workers are using technology, constantly negotiating with those platforms makes their selves, work and livelihoods even more precarious,"" van der Nagel says. ""This is a huge problem.""    As a result of social stigma and discrimination, sex workers are already placed in difficult situations both financially and physically, says van der Nagel. FOSTA-SESTA exacerbates that.    ""FOSTA-SESTA fucked the entire industry,"" says Jenna Love.OnlyFans is very much in the midst of its moment.    ""OnlyFans has become the Tupperware or Kleenex of porn platforms,"" Jenna Love says. ""But it's not the only option.""    Love is absolutely correct. Many performers sell pornography using platforms like Patreon, ManyVids and even Snapchat, but, in 2021, none of these alternatives offers the reach and influence of OnlyFans. The site had 90 million users and over 1 million content creators, up from 120,000 in 2019, as of December, according to The New York Times.    A ""social platform revolutionizing creator and fan connections,"" OnlyFans launched four years ago, but in January 2020 garnered mainstream attention when Kaylen Ward -- aka the Naked Philanthropist -- raised around $1 million in relief for Australian bushfires by selling nudes on the service.     As a sex worker living in Australia, Love knows she's losing money by not having a presence on the site, but has issues with how the site operates. OnlyFans is ""making bank"" on the back of sex workers, she says, but treats them with disrespect.    There's a massive tension, she says, between how OnlyFans describes itself and what it actually is. OnlyFans, she explains, doesn't think of itself as a porn platform and isn't necessarily friendly to the clientele that earns it a significant chunk of its revenue.    In 2020, OnlyFans went mainstream. Beyonce name-dropped it in a song with Megan Thee Stallion. Even celebrities like Cardi B are getting onboard, charging users for monthly subscription fees for content like fan Q&As and behind-the-scenes footage of video shoots.    But sex workers, believes Love, are getting left behind. ""Celebrities and Instagram influencers have a grand old time on OnlyFans. But those of us for whom this is actually our job get booted off.""    Bella Thorne caused controversy when she launched an OnlyFans account last year.Enter Bella Thorne.    A 22-year-old former Disney star with 24 million followers on Instagram, Thorne broke OnlyFans records when she created an account in August last year. After misleading subscribers into purchasing a ""nude"" photo for $200 (which turned out not to be a nude), Thorne made $1 million in a single day, but left a trail of destruction in her wake.    As a result of her actions, OnlyFans was overwhelmed with refund demands. Thorne's representatives didn't respond to a request for comment.    Weeks afterward, OnlyFans limited the amount content creators could charge for ""exclusive"" content to $50 and changed its payments from weekly to monthly.    Sex workers weren't happy. The payment shift from weekly to monthly was one thing, but for many OnlyFans creators, the ability to charge extra for exclusive content was a major source of income. It functioned as an additional paywall. In addition, OnlyFans put caps on the tips system, which also limited the amount creators could make from their subscriber base. All up, the changes dramatically reduced the amount creators could make from the service.    Bee hadn't been banned from OnlyFans. She was eventually able to get back online and access her earnings, but it was a stark reminder of how vulnerable she was. And how quickly she could lose it all.    ""I know it sounds dramatic,"" she remembers, ""but I felt like I was gonna die.""    Bee scours her OnlyFans account constantly, fearful a subscriber might ask for escort services in a direct message. Fearful that an old Twitter account, linked to her OnlyFans, might mention that she does escort work on the side.    ""I'm always so panicked I'm going to wake up one morning and it'll all be gone,"" she explains.    ""To exist online is really tough,"" adds Love. Both Love and Bee have dummy accounts on multiple social media platforms, in case they get removed for the wrong kind of tweet or for a photograph that's too revealing. This is common practice for anyone involved in sex work.    Despite arguments that the presence of OnlyFans is helping destigmatize sex work, Love believes its move to the mainstream has only made things worse.    Van der Nagel believes OnlyFans could really help ease the stigma attached to sex work.""[OnlyFans] destigmatized the hot chick who wants to sell some nudes. It's 'you go girl, make your money.' But those of us who are actually sex workers are still thought of as filthy whores.""    Van der Nagel believes OnlyFans -- given its influence -- could properly destigmatize sex work, by creating a charter that explicitly lays out its support for those involved.    ""If OnlyFans came out and said, 'We're in support of sex work,' that could be a meaningful step to taking the shame out of sex work as a profession. They're really missing an opportunity to say, 'Sex is a normal part of a healthy adult life.'""    Charter or no charter, Love still wants no part of OnlyFans. She says the site has ""spent years profiting from sex workers"" with zero acknowledgement. She'd rather support platforms she believes are more supportive of sex workers, like AVNStars or JustFor.Fans.    Bee feels like she has to be more pragmatic. She's built a loyal community on OnlyFans. Many of her followers subscribe to multiple creators on the site and would be reluctant to sign up for another service.    ""I can't presume they will be loyal and follow me wherever I go,"" she says. ""You don't wanna bite the hand that feeds you.""     "
291,What the AT&amp;T Breakup Teaches Us About a Big Tech Breakup,Business,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/what-att-breakup-teaches-us-about-big-tech-breakup,"The multi-pronged attempt by state Attorneys General, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission to find Google and Facebook liable for violating antitrust law may result in breaking up these giant companies. But in order for any of this to cause lasting change, we need to look to the not-so-recent past. In the world of antitrust, the calls to “break up” Big Tech companies translate to the fairly standard remedy of “structural separation,” where companies are barred from selling services and competing with the buyers of those services (for example, rail companies have been forced to stop selling freight services that compete with their own customers). It has been done before as part of the fight against communication monopolies. However, history shows us that the real work is not just breaking up companies, but following through afterward. In order to make sure that the Internet becomes a space for innovation and competition, there has to be a vision of an ideal ecosystem. When we look back at the United States’ previous move from telecom monopoly into what can best be described as “regulated competition,” we can learn a lot of lessons—good and bad—about what can be done post-breakup.Cast your mind back, back to when AT&T was a giant corporation. No, further back. When AT&T was the world’s largest corporation and the telephone monopoly. In the 1970s, AT&T resembled Big Tech companies in scale, significance, and influence. AT&T grew by relentlessly gobbling up rival companies and eventually struck a deal with the government to make its monopolization legal in exchange for universal service (known as the Kingsbury Commitment). As a monopolist, AT&T's unilateral decisions dictated the way people communicated. The company exerted extraordinary influence over public debate and used its influence to argue that its monopoly was in the public interest. Its final antitrust battle was a quagmire that spanned two political administrations, and despite this, its political power was so great that it was able to get the Department of Defense to claim its monopoly was vital to national security.  Today, Big Tech is reenacting the battle of the AT&T of yore. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg assertion that his company’s dominance is the only means to compete with China is a repeat of AT&T’s attempt to use national security to bypass competition concerns. Similarly, Facebook's recent change of heart on whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be gutted is an effort to appease policymakers looking to scrutinize the company's dominance. Not coincidentally, Section 230 is the lifeblood of every would-be competitor to Facebook. In trading 230 in for policy concessions, Facebook both escapes a breakup and salts the earth against the growth of any new competitors to become the regulated monopoly that remains.Google is a modern AT&T, too. Google acquired its way to dominance by purchasing a multitude of companies to extend its vertical reach over the years. Mergers and acquisitions were key to AT&T's monopoly strategy. That's why the government then sought to break up the company – and that's why the US government today is proposing breakups for  Google. Now, with AT&T, there were clear geographic lines on which the company could be broken into smaller regional companies. It's different for Google and Facebook: those lines will have to be drawn along different parts of the companies ""stack,"" such as advertising and platforms. When the US Department of Justice broke up AT&T, it traded one national monopoly for a set of regional monopolies. Over time Congress learned that it wasn't enough. Likewise, breakups for Google and Facebook will only be step one.  Supporters of structural separation for Big Tech need to learn the lessons of the past. Our forebears got it right initially with telecom but then failed to sustain a consistent vision of competition eventually allowing dozens of companies to consolidate into a mix of regional monopolies or super dominant national companies.When originally passed, the 1996 telecom law Congress passed to follow the AT&T breakup enabled the creation of the Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (aka CLEC) industry. These were smaller companies that already existed but had been severely hamstrung by the local monopolies. Their reach was severely limited because there was no federal competition law.The  1996 Act lowered the start-up costs for new phone companies: they wouldn't have to build an entire network from scratch. The Act forced the Baby Bells (the regional parts of the original AT&T monopoly) to share their ""essential facilities"" with these new competitors at a fair price, opening the market to much smaller players with much less capital. But the incumbent monopolies still had friends in statehouses and Congress. By 2001, federal and state governments began adopting a new theory of competition in communications: ""deregulated competition""—which whittled away the facilities sharing rules and rules banning the broken up parts of AT&T from merging with one another again (as well as cable and wireless companies). If the purpose of this untested, unproven approach was to promote competition, then clearly it was a failure. A majority of Americans today have only one choice for high-speed broadband access that meets 21st century needs. There has been no serious reckoning for ""deregulated competition"" and it remains the heart of telecom policy despite nearly every prediction of the benefits of ""deregulated competition"" having been proven wrong. This only happened because policymakers and the public forgot how they received competition in telecom in the first place and allowed the unwinding that remains with us still today. Steve Coll, author of The Deal of the Century: The Breakup of AT&T, predicted this problem shortly after the AT&T's breakup:It is quite possible - some would argue it is more than likely - that the final landscape of the Bell System breakup will include a bankrupted MCI and an AT&T returned to its original state as a regulated, albeit smaller and less effective, telephone monopoly. The source of this specter lies not in anyone's crystal ball but in the history of U.S. v. AT&T. Precious little in that history - the birth of MCI, the development of phone industry competition, the filing of the Justice lawsuit, the prolonged inaction of Congress, the aborted compromise deals between Justice and AT&T, the Reagan administration's tortured passivity, the final inter-intra settlement itself - was the product of a single coherent philosophy, or a genuine, reasoned consensus, or a farsighted public policy strategy.Anyone thinking about Big Tech breakups needs to learn the lesson of AT&T.  Breakups are just step one. Before we take that step, we need to know what steps we'll take next. We need a plan for post-break-up regulated competition, or we'll squander years and years of antitrust courtroom battles, only to see the fragments of the companies reform into new, unstoppable juggernauts. We need a common narrative about where competition comes from and how we sustain it.Like phone companies, internet platforms have “network effects”: to compete with them, a new company needs access, not the company's ""ecosystem"" – the cluster of products and services monopolists weave around themselves to lock in users, squeeze suppliers, and fend off competitors. In '96, we forced regional monopolies to share their facilities and thousands of local ISPs sprung up across the country, almost overnight. Creating a durable competitive threat to tech monopolists means finding similar measures to promote a flourishing, pluralistic, diverse Internet. We've always said that tech industry competition is a multifaceted project that calls for multiple laws and careful regulation. Changes to antitrust law, intellectual property law, intermediary liability, and consumer privacy legislation all play critical and integral parts in a more competitive future. Strike the wrong balance and you drain away the Internet's capacity for putting power in the hands of people and communities. Get any of the policies wrong and you risk strangling a hundred future Googles and Facebooks in their cradles—companies whose destiny is to grow for a time but to eventually be replaced by new upstarts better suited for the unforeseeable circumstances of the future. Here are two examples of policies that are every bit as important as breakups for creating and maintaining a competitive digital world:The Internet once stood for a world where people with good ideas and a little know-how could change the world, attracting millions of users and spawning dozens of competitors. That was the Net's lifecycle of competition. We can get that future back, but only if we commit to a shared and durable vision of competition. It's fine to talk about breaking up Big Tech, but the hard part starts after the companies are split up. Now is the time to start asking what competition should look like, or we'll get dragged back to our current future before we get started down the road to a better one.

292,Lordstown Motors' electric race truck is (mostly) ready for off-roading,Transportation,https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-endurance-race-truck-214135593.html,"Lordstown Motors wants to prove its Endurance electric truck is ready for the wilderness through a familiar strategy: it's entering a prominent race. Autoblog reports that Lordstown has unveiled a race-ready version of its Endurance Beta truck that will compete in the SCORE World Desert Championship's San Felipe 250 on April 17th. The upgraded EV is ready for the Mexican race with larger off-road wheels (complete with wider fender flares), four high-power driving lights and the removal of 'frills' like mirrors, windows and much of the cabin's luxuries.The race will ideally prove that the Endurance is the ""toughest, most robust"" truck on the planet even as it cuts emissions, company chief Steve Burns claimed.If all goes well, the Lordstown racer could provide further evidence that electric trucks are ready for extreme conditions. If they can handle the bumps and bruises of off-roading, you might be more likely to buy an Endurance for your own off-the-beaten-path excursions.The competition might underscore the current limitations of EVs, however.

That’s a drop from the year before, when 67,500 mobile users were affected, but still up from the 40,386 instances detected amongst Kaspersky’s client base in 2018.This is despite the fact that Google banned stalkerware apps from Google Play last year.Stalkerware is defined as software that can be installed on someone’s phone, allowing the person’s physical location to be tracked, calls and messages monitored, social-media activity snooped upon, and photos and videos to be seen. It can also switch on a device’s camera to see what the target is doing or who the person is with.In general, it allows someone to remotely spy on another person’s life via their digital device. This is usually done without the affected user giving their consent or being notified. The Coalition Against Stalkerware warns that these pernicious apps “may facilitate intimate partner surveillance, harassment, abuse, stalking and/or violence.”The issue statistically does correlate to physical abuse: According to a report by the European Institute for Gender Equality, seven in 10 women in Europe who have experienced cyberstalking have also experienced at least one form of physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner.Russia, Brazil, the United States, India and Mexico were the top five countries where users were most impacted in 2020, in that order, according to Kaspersky’s report. The U.S. passed India, rising on the list from fourth place in 2019 to third in 2020.Germany was the top European country, occupying sixth place in the global rankings. Iran, Italy, the United Kingdom and, lastly, Saudi Arabia complete the 10 most-affected nations.“We see the number of users affected by stalkerware has remained high and we detect new samples every day,” said Victor Chebyshev, research development team lead, Kaspersky, in a media statement. “It’s important to remember that there is somebody’s real life story behind all these numbers, and sometimes there is a silent call for help.”It’s notable that “the yearly curve began to rise again in the second half of 2020, after some lockdown measures were lifted,” the report added. The reason that lockdowns may have affected the rate of stalkerware installation is because targets would be less likely to be out and about, reducing the need for keeping track of someone’s physical movements and remote activity.The first two months of the year were in line with numbers from the year before. The situation changed in March when many countries decided to announce quarantine measures. Volumes began to rise again in June, when many countries around the world eased restrictions.Stalkerware instances, month by month. Source: Kaspersky.With more than 8,100 users affected globally, Nidb is the most-used stalkerware strain, according to Kaspersky’s stats. The code forms the core of several stalkerware brands, researchers said, including iSpyoo, TheTruthSpy and Copy9, among others.“The Nidb creator sells their product as stalkerware-as-a-service,” according to the firm. “This means that anyone could rent their control server software and mobile application, rename it to any suitable marketing name and sell it separately.”Source: Kaspersky.Both second and eighth place are occupied by different versions of Cerberus – an Android malware that started life as a banking trojan, but which is now a fully fledged remote access trojan (RAT) available for rent in underground forums.And Agent.af comes in third place, which is marketed as the “Track My Phone” app. It can read messages from any messenger, log a person’s call history and track geolocation.Some apps do try to get around bans by Google and others by claiming to do something else entirely. The “Anlost” malware for instance, No. 4 on Kaspersky’s Top 10 most-common stalkerwares, is advertised as an antitheft application. It can intercept SMS messages and read the call log of a device.“And its icon is present on the home screen (not usual behavior for stealthy stalkerware apps),” according to the report. “Therefore, it is available on the Google Play store. That said, it is possible to deliberately hide the icon from the home screen.”Stalkerware companies have also sold apps that purport to help parents track their young children – even though their capabilities could be used for other purposes. Increasingly, app gatekeepers are cracking down on these types of offerings.That was the case with three Retina-X apps, which were barred by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC): MobileSpy, PhoneSheriff and TeenShield. While these three apps were marketed for monitoring mobile devices used by children, or for monitoring employees, the FTC determined that they “were designed to run surreptitiously in the background and are uniquely suited to illegal and dangerous uses.”Another example is an app called “Monitor Minor,” which researchers flagged as problematic last year. The Android version of the app gives stalkers near absolute control of targeted devices, going so far as allowing them to capture the unlock pattern or unlock code of phones.Stalkerware isn’t delivered in the same way as other malware; it can’t be sent via a sneaky email or installed in some other remote way, Kaspersky said. This means that the abuser will need to have physical access to a device in order to install it. Once past any lock-screen, it only takes a few minutes to load an app, researchers said.“The main barrier that exists is that stalkerware has to be configured on an affected device,” according to the report. “Due to the distribution vector of such applications which are very different from common malware distribution schemes, it is impossible to get infected with a stalkerware through a spam message including a link to stalkerware or a trap via normal web surfing.”Stalkerware is usually downloaded from third-party sources. This is easy for Android users; but iPhone stalkerware tools are less frequent because iOS is traditionally a closed system with apps from third party stores barred from running on it.However, “an abuser can offer their victim an iPhone – or any other device – with pre-installed stalkerware as a gift,” according to Kaspersky. “There are many companies who make their services available online to install such tools on a new phone and deliver it to an unwitting addressee in factory packaging to celebrate a special occasion.”To check for stalkerware, users can run an antivirus solution, and keep an eye out for a fast-draining battery, constant overheating and mobile data traffic growth. Users can also check the browser history, because an abuser would have needed to download the app from a website.Users should also check to see if “unknown sources” are enabled on devices; this might be a sign that unwanted software was installed from third-party source. And, they should check the permissions of installed apps: Stalkerware applications may be disguised under a wrong name with suspicious access to messages, call logs, location and other personal activity.“It’s hard for everyday users to know if stalkerware is installed on their devices,” according to Kaspersky. “Generally, this type of software remains hidden which includes hiding the icon of the stalkerware app on the home screen and in the phone menu and even cleaning any traces that have been made. However, it may give itself away and there are some warning signs.”Share this article:Website admins should patch all plugins, WordPress itself and back-end servers as soon as possible.A new variant of the Gafgyt botnet – that’s actively targeting vulnerable D-Link and Internet of Things devices – is the first variant of the malware to rely on Tor communications, researchers say.Wireless mouse-utility lacks proper authentication and opens Windows systems to attack.Notify me when new comments are added.

294,South Korean tech firms shake up Japan's storied manga industry,Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-manga-idUSKCN2AT0YP,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Sam Nussey4 Min ReadTOKYO (Reuters) - Two South Korean technology companies are borrowing from mobile gaming to shake up - and dominate - Japan’s storied manga industry, a plot twist that has expanded the comics’ fanbase to a new generation of readers.Backed by tech giants Kakao Corp and Naver Corp, Piccoma and Line Manga have become Japan’s highest-grossing mobile apps outside games. Such online manga platforms have seen a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic.Piccoma’s third-quarter transaction volumes more than tripled year on year to 11.6 billion yen ($110 million), extending a wave of online manga sales that has already seen digital surpass print in Japan’s $5 billion manga industry.Line Manga, now operated by SoftBank’s internet business Z Holdings, saw transaction volumes jump by a third to 8.2 billion yen in the same period. Naver declined an interview request.Piccoma passed Line Manga to become last year’s top-grossing manga app on both Apple’s IoS and Android. Its rise can be traced back to 2016, when it introduced a revenue model it calls “zero yen if you wait.”The app’s manga tales - from classroom love stories to supernatural horror - are serialized. Users must wait for a timer to unlock the next instalment, or pay to read ahead.Inspired by smartphone games in which playing is free but extra content is not, the approach marked a radical departure from the typical model of selling an entire manga volume up front at prices of $4-$6.“We thought if we could grab 5% or 10% of the bigger games market it would drive growth,” said Yukiko Sugiyama, senior manager in Kakao Japan’s business strategy department.Readers, eager to find out what happens next, often end up paying. The business model has become standard as dozens of book sellers, tech companies and publishers rushed to offer their own apps.Megumi, a 34-year-old office worker in western Japan, said she reads 20 pages or so of manga on her phone during her lunch break, and turned to the two apps when stuck at home taking care of kids during last year’s pandemic state of emergency.She became “addicted” to and paid for a hit Line Manga series, “True Beauty”, about a young woman whose makeup skills make her popular with men.The strip originated in Korea, where the rise of the internet saw paper sales collapse, replaced by smartphone-optimised comics.Manga apps offer a vast back catalogue of titles and exclusive strips.“You can read manga carrying just your smartphone - it’s handy,” said Kana Misaki, a 36-year-old care worker living near Tokyo who reads manga “overwhelmingly” via apps.In Japan, online manga is generally still formatted like a book, and traditional publishers are a powerful force, with editors closely involved in each stage of production.Printed in black and white on cheap paper, paper manga remains affordable and disposable. The industry is protected under Japanese law from books being sold for less than their cover price, even online.“For new titles, paper sales are much higher,” said Shu Hashimoto, an editor at publisher Kodansha’s long-running Weekly Shonen Magazine.Even the most ardent app users say they will buy paper editions of their favourite titles.“You don’t know when titles will disappear from the apps, so when I want them close at hand I buy them,” Misaki said.($1 = 103.6900 yen)Reporting by Sam Nussey and Yuki Nitta; Editing by Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

But the increase in speed and capacity of 4G LTE (and now 5G) networks has opened up another option.Traditional hurdles that made this less than an ideal solution—data caps, expense, bandwidth, coverage, compatible hardware—are slowly becoming less of an issue as the technology improves, and it's now very possible to switch completely from standard broadband to 4G LTE broadband—with a few caveats and conditions.Routers such as the Netgear Orbi can bring 4G LTE into your home.The idea behind 4G LTE at home is pretty simple at its core: Deliver internet access to your home in the same way that your phone gets online when it's away from Wi-Fi. If you've ever tried to connect your laptop to a hot spot running from your phone, then you know what's involved, together with all the potential pros (wireless internet access anywhere) and cons (interference and bandwidth issues).Eric RavenscraftKlint Finley and Joanna PearlsteinWill KnightUsing a 4G LTE home internet service isn't quite the same as running a hot spot though. Instead of having everything come through your phone, you set up a router to speak directly to the 4G LTE network, and then that router converts the signal into the conventional Wi-Fi that we all know and love. You don't need SIM cards for every gadget you're connecting, because they just see your home Wi-Fi as normal.We'll explain some of the speeds you might get in the selection of packages we've outlined below, but the theoretical maximum transfer speed is around 1 Gbps for 4G LTE (and 10 times that for 5G). In reality and outside of a laboratory, you won't see that, but if you're in the right area to get a good signal, then a 4G LTE connection can make your existing home broadband seem sluggish by comparison. Latency—the speed with which your inputs reach the web and ping back again—can be a problem for certain uses such as gaming, but like most other technologies, 4G LTE is getting better over time. As the years go by it's also getting cheaper, reaching more areas at faster speeds, and becoming more viable for more people. Other restrictions such as data caps are starting to disappear in some cases too, though it's still worth bearing these caps in mind when comparing services. Traditionally, restrictions on data use have been one of the main reasons not to make the switch to 4G LTE for home connectivity.As both conventional broadband and 4G LTE internet end up at a Wi-Fi router inside your home, you're really just comparing a certain section of the infrastructure: that link between your property and the internet at large. Whether a cable running up to your home or a 4G LTE signal beamed from a nearby cell tower is going to be preferable will depend on numerous factors, with your geographical location perhaps the most important.4G LTE internet availability is subject to the same kind of restrictions and limitations as any other type of internet, from fiber-optic broadband to satellite networks: It has to be cost-effective for companies to offer it at your address, with all the regulatory and infrastructure and pricing considerations that involves. Whether it's the right solution for you is going to depend first and foremost on whether or not you can actually get it, and then how it compares to the traditional broadband options you have.There are plenty of gadgets and gizmos you can pick up to create your own bespoke solution, from antennas to hot spots. Just plug a SIM card into the $300 Netgear Orbi 4G LTE, for example, and it'll convert the cellular signal received by the router into Wi-Fi for your whole home. For a similar price you can pick up the HTC 5G Hub if 5G happens to have rolled out in your neck of the woods already.Verizon offers one of the 4G LTE home internet packages you can pick from.All 4G LTE home internet packages are limited in terms of their availability by area—every signup page has a tool that you can use to see if the service is live wherever you live. Assuming your zip code qualifies, you'll be provided with the necessary hardware to get your home online, and you can usually set everything up yourself. Be sure to read the small print, though, especially when it comes to data caps, throttling, and congestion.AT&T Fixed Wireless Internet starts at $59.99 per month plus taxes and uses both an outdoor antenna and an indoor router to convert 4G LTE into a Wi-Fi network that blankets your property. The carrier quotes typical download speeds of 25 Mbps (with a minimum speed of 10 Mbps) and typical upload speeds of 1 Mbps, and you get 350 GB per month of bundled data to use before excess charges apply.Verizon LTE Home Internet Service can be yours for $40 per month plus taxes if you're on a Verizon mobile plan, and $60 if you're not. Verizon claims ""typical download speeds of 25 Mbps,"" and there are no data caps, so you can stream and download as much as you want. In the case of the Verizon service, all you need is the router that will be supplied to you, which once installed will connect to 4G LTE and convert it to Wi-Fi for your home.T-Mobile Home Internet is going to set you back $50 a month plus taxes if it's available in your area. T-Mobile says that ""the vast majority of our customers experience speeds of 25 Mbps or more""—the same figure mentioned by AT&T and Verizon—but the company does seem to be a bit more honest in admitting that you might not see those speeds all of the time. There are no data caps with the T-Mobile service though, so you can download and upload as much as you want without it costing you anything extra.There are third-party companies who will sell you some internet as well, making use of the 4G LTE infrastructure set up by the carriers and focusing particularly on rural areas. NoLimitData has a $90 per month, unlimited data plan you can take advantage of, for example, while the UbiFi package is a little more at $100 per month. Both providers promise to get your hardware and connection up and running as quickly as they can and with the best possible speeds for your area.Of course, you can just use your phone as a hot spot for everything in your home rather than signing up for one of the packages we've mentioned above—but it's not going to have the same multi-device management capabilities as a dedicated 4G LTE router, and there might well be complications in regards to your SIM card data usage as well (check with your network if you're not sure).And what of 5G? Well, think 4G LTE home internet, only faster (Verizon already offers it). The same socioeconomic factors are in play though, and if 5G does have a weakness, then it's range—to get the very best speeds from 5G you need to be close to an antenna, which may limit its effectiveness whether you're living in the middle of nowhere or in the middle of a big group of apartments.

297,"City A.M.: ""Nvidia resists UK jobs guarantee after $40bn Arm takeover""",Business,https://www.cityam.com/nvidia-resists-uk-jobs-guarantee-after-40bn-arm-takeover/,"British chipmaker Arm is facing uncertainty over its future headcount as Nvidia resists a guarantee on jobs following its planned $40bn (£29bn) takeover.California-based Nvidia is in talks with the government over potential commitments linked to the mammoth merger, including maintaining Arm’s headquarters in Cambridge.Read more: Google and Microsoft object to Nvidia’s $40bn Arm takeoverThe company has pledged to keep the chip giant in the UK and increase its investment in Britain. However, it is yet to sign up to any targets on Arm’s headcount.In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said his firm was wary of being bound by any target.“The type of talent we would like to bring to the UK and invest in the UK, are not that readily available. They’re not a dime a dozen,” he said. “I will hire as many Einsteins as there are.”A Nvidia spokesperson said the company was in “constructive discussions” with the government.“We share the government’s interest in ensuring that Arm thrives in the UK,” they said. “We plan to hire as many world-class researchers and computer scientists as we can, right in the UK.”Current owner Softbank entered into a legally-binding commitment to double Arm’s headcount within five years following its takeover in 2016. It is now racing to meet this target, which expires in September this year.A filing published in October shows Arm has 3,004 employees in the UK — a figure that must rise to 3,494 by September.But Nvidia’s reluctance to commit to further job guarantees will fuel concerns about the impact of the deal on Britain’s tech landscape.Former business secretary Lord Peter Mandelson last year branded the deal “short-sighted”, accusing ministers of “waving the Union Jack while selling off the crown jewels”.The government has said it is willing to set conditions on the transaction if it is deemed to pose a threat to national security.Read more: Competition watchdog to probe Nvidia’s $40bn Arm takeoverNvidia is also facing a probe by competition regulators in the US and UK, while Google and Microsoft have both lodged complaints about the impact of the merger on the chip market.The US company has defended its plans for Arm, pledging to maintain the British chipmaker’s neutral licensing model.Copyright © 2021 CityAM.

298,Exclusive: India woos Tesla with offer of cheaper production costs than China,Politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-tesla-minister-exclusive-idUSKBN2AU1AY,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Aftab Ahmed, Aditi Shah4 Min ReadNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is ready to offer incentives to ensure Tesla Inc’s cost of production would be less than in China if the carmaker commits to making its electric vehicles in the south Asian country, transport minister Nitin Gadkari told Reuters.Gadkari’s pitch comes weeks after billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla registered a company in India in a step towards entering the country, possibly as soon as mid-2021. Sources familiar with the matter have said Tesla plans to start by importing and selling its Model 3 electric sedan in India.“Rather than assembling (the cars) in India they should make the entire product in the country by hiring local vendors. Then we can give higher concessions,” Gadkari said in an interview, without giving details of what incentives would be on offer.“The government will make sure the production cost for Tesla will be the lowest when compared with the world, even China, when they start manufacturing their cars in India. We will assure that,” he said.India wants to boost local manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and other components to cut costly imports and curb pollution in its major cities.This comes amid a global race by carmakers to jump-start EV production as countries work towards cutting carbon emissions.But India faces a big challenge to win a production commitment from Tesla, which did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment about its plans in the country.India’s fledgling EV market accounted for just 5,000 out of a total 2.4 million cars sold in the country last year as negligible charging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs deterred buyers.In contrast, China, where Tesla already makes cars, sold 1.25 million new energy passenger vehicles, including EVs, in 2020 out of total sales of 20 million, and accounted for more than a third of Tesla’s global sales.India also doesn’t have a comprehensive EV policy like China, the world’s biggest auto market, which mandates companies to invest in the sector.Gadkari said that as well as being a big market, India could be an export hub, especially with about 80% of components for lithium-ion batteries being made locally now.“I think it’s a win-win situation for Tesla,” Gadkari said, adding he also wanted to engage with Tesla about building an ultra high-speed hyperloop between Delhi and Mumbai.India is drawing up a production-linked incentive scheme for auto and auto component makers as well as for setting up advanced battery manufacturing units, but the details are yet to be finalised.Switching to cleaner sources of energy and reducing vehicle pollution are seen as essential for India to meet its Paris Accord climate commitments.India last year introduced tougher emission rules for carmakers to bring them up to international standards. It is now looking at tightening fuel efficiency rules from April 2022, which industry executives say may compel some automakers to add electric or hybrid vehicles to their portfolios.Battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry says it needs longer to make the transition.Gadkari said he was not directly responsible for making the decision on whether to delay, but was confident India would meet its Paris treaty commitments without disrupting economic growth.“Development and environment will go hand in hand. We will take some time but we will soon reach the international standard norms,” he said.Reporting by Aftab Ahmed and Aditi Shah.

299,Scientists Invent Light-Up OLED Tatttoos,Hardware,https://gizmodo.com/scientists-have-invented-light-up-oled-tattoos-1846379012,"Tattoos are usually considered a form of personal expression, but a team of researchers in Europe have created what they’re calling the world’s first light-emitting tattoo based on OLED screen technology that, besides presumably looking kind of cool, could also serve as a visible warning about potential health concerns.Tattoos are used by people to show their devotion to a long-extinct brand of MP3 player or letting everyone know just how much they love their moms. But there’s also a precedent for tattoos being used as a medical tool. Cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy are tattooed with small dots that are used as reference marks  for precisely targeting the machines used for treatments during repeat sessions, for example.Inspired by bioluminescent organisms, the DIY biohackers at Grindhouse Wetware have unveiled their…The idea of personally augmenting one’s skin with glowing art isn’t new either, but previously this has involved biohackers implanting technologies like LEDs beneath the skin, and the results don’t have much practical use besides attention-grabbing or inviting questions about why someone would do that to themselves. This new approach to light-emitting tattoos is easier to apply, more practical, and temporary—without requiring surgery to have it removed.In a recently published paper in the Advanced Electronic Materials journal, “Ultrathin, Ultra‐Conformable, and Free‐Standing Tattooable Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes,” scientists from the University College London in the UK and the Italian Institute of Technology detail how their new approach to tattoos relies on the same organic light-emitting diode technology featured in devices like more recent iPhones, as well as the recent crop of mobile devices featuring folding screens. The flexibility of an OLED display is important for this application given human skin is so pliable and flexes and folds as the body moves.The actual electronics of the light-emitting tattoos, made from an extremely thin layer of an electroluminescent polymer that glows when a charge is applied, measure in at just 2.3-micrometers thick, which, according to the researchers, is about one-third the diameter of a red blood cell. The polymer layer is then sandwiched between a pair of electrodes and sits atop an insulating layer, which is bonded to temporary tattoo paper through a printing process that isn’t prohibitively expensive. The tattoos can be easily applied to surfaces using the same wet transfer process that temporary tattoos designed for kids use, and can be easily washed off when no longer needed or wanted using soap and water.With a current applied the OLED tattoos in their current form simply glow green, but eventually could produce any color using the same RGB approach that OLED screens use. However, while the researchers acknowledge that the potential for glowing tattoos is there, taking that art in a whole new direction, they also see even more potential for them as a medical tool. When combined with other wearable technologies the light-emitting tattos could start flashing when an athlete needs to rehydrate, or change color when applied to foods providing obvious warnings when expiration dates have passed.But don’t stroll into your local tattoo parlor and demand one of those fancy new glowing tattoos just yet. The researchers have so far successfully applied them to surfaces like glass, plastic bottles, paper, and even oranges, but human skin poses a bigger challenge given how much humans are constantly moving around. The OLEDs polymers can also quickly degrade when exposed to the air, requiring additional layers to properly encapsulate and protect them, and there’s an even bigger issue of finding a way to power them using tiny batteries or supercapacitors, as so far in the lab they’ve been wired to an external power source, and it’s doubtful anyone is going to want to attach a USB power cable to the ink on their arms.Senior Staff ReporterGreat.

300,"Digidog, a Robotic Dog Used by the Police, Stirs Privacy Concerns",Robotics/Automation,https://www.yahoo.com/now/digidog-robotic-dog-used-police-153453166.html,"NEW YORK — Two men were being held hostage in a Bronx apartment. They had been threatened at gunpoint, tied up and tortured for hours by two other men who pretended to be plumbers to get inside, police said.One of the victims managed to escape and called the police, who showed up early Tuesday morning at the apartment on East 227th Street, unsure if the armed men were still inside.The police decided it was time to deploy Digidog, a 70-pound robotic dog with a loping gait, cameras and lights affixed to its frame, and a two-way communication system that allows the officer maneuvering it remotely to see and hear what is happening.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesPolice said the robot can see in the dark and assess how safe it is for officers to enter an apartment or building where there may be a threat.In the case of the Bronx home invasion, police said Digidog helped the officers determine that there was no one inside. Police said they were still searching for the two men, who stole a cellphone and $2,000 in cash and used a hot iron to burn one of the victims.“The NYPD has been using robots since the 1970s to save lives in hostage situations & hazmat incidents,” the department said on Twitter. “This model of robot is being tested to evaluate its capabilities against other models in use by our emergency service unit and bomb squad.”But the robot has skeptics.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, described Digidog on Twitter as a “robotic surveillance ground” drone.“Please ask yourself: When was the last time you saw next-generation, world-class technology for education, health care, housing, etc. consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?” she said on Twitter, linking to a New York Post story about Digidog.The City Council passed the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act last June amid efforts to overhaul the police force, many of them triggered by Black Lives Matter demonstrations.The act requires the Police Department to be more transparent about its surveillance and technology tools, including Digidog, something civil libertarians said had been lacking.Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union, said empowering a robot to do police work could have implications for bias, mobile surveillance, hacking and privacy. There is also concern that the robot could be paired with other technology and be weaponized.“We do see a lot of police departments adopting powerful new surveillance and other technology without telling, let alone asking, the communities they serve,” he said. “So openness and transparency is key.”The New York Police Department did not respond to requests for comment about the civil liberty concerns.A mobile device that can gather intelligence about a volatile situation remotely has “tremendous potential” to limit injuries and fatalities, said Keith Taylor, a former SWAT team sergeant at the police department who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.“It’s important to question police authority; however, this appears to be pretty straightforward,” he said. “It is designed to help law enforcement get the information they need without having a deadly firefight, for instance.”The New York Police Department is among three in the country that have the mechanical dog, which is built by Boston Dynamics, a tech company known for videos of its robots dancing and jumping with eerie, humanlike fluidity.Boston Dynamics began selling the robot dog, which it calls Spot, last June. Most buyers have been utility and energy companies as well as manufacturers and construction companies, which use it to get into spaces too dangerous for humans, said Michael Perry, vice president of business development at the company.The robot has been used to inspect sites with hazardous material. Early in the pandemic, it was used by health care workers to communicate with potentially sick patients at hospital triage sites, Perry said.Most of the companies rename the robot after they buy it, giving it names like Bolt and Mac and Cheese, he said.The Massachusetts State Police and the Honolulu Police Department are also using the robotic dog, which has a 90-minute battery life and walks at a speed of 3 mph.Other police departments have called the company to learn more about the robot, which has a starting price of about $74,000 and may cost more with extra features, Perry said.The robotic dog, which bears a resemblance to those featured in the 2017 “Metalhead” episode of “Black Mirror,” was not designed to act as a covert tool of mass surveillance, Perry said.“It’s noisy and has flashing lights,” he said. “It’s not something that is discreet.”The use of robots that can be deployed into dangerous situations to keep police officers out of harm’s way could become the norm.In Dallas in 2016, police ended a standoff with a gunman sought in the killings of five officers by blowing him up using a robot.In 2015, a man with a knife who threatened to jump off a bridge in San Jose, California, was taken into custody after police had a robot bring him a cellphone and a pizza.And in 2014, police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, used a robot to “deploy chemical munitions” in a motel room where a man had barricaded himself with a gun, a department report said. He surrendered.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.© 2021 The New York Times Company"
301,Solar cars: Driving on sunshine,Transportation,https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Solar-cars-Driving-on-sunshine-15982099.php,"The dream began in 1955, with a tiny, toylike creation called the ""Sunmobile."" Built from balsa wood and hobby shop tires, it was just 15 inches long. The 12 selenium solar cells that decorated its exterior produced less horsepower than an actual horse. But it was proof of a concept: Sunlight alone can make a vehicle run.The years went on, and the dream evolved into a converted vintage buggy with solar panels on its roof. Then a glorified bicycle, a retiree's garage project, a racecar that crossed the Mojave Desert at 51 miles per hour.It is a dream of perpetual motion. Of travel that doesn't do damage to the planet. Of journeys that last as long as the sun shines.There are problems with this dream, big ones. Clouds come. Night falls. The laws of physics limit how efficiently solar panels can turn light into energy.But one start-up claims it has overcome those problems. Now, its founders say, the dream can be yours for as little as $25,900.Aptera Motors, a California company whose name comes from the ancient Greek for ""wingless,"" is rolling out the first mass-produced solar car this year. It's a three-wheel, ultra-aerodynamic electric vehicle covered in 34 square feet of solar cells. The car is so efficient that, on a clear day, those cells alone could provide enough energy to drive about 40 miles - more than twice the distance of the average American's commute.The Aptera must undergo safety tests before the company can begin distribution, which it hopes to do by the end of this year. Even then, it's not clear that consumers will want to buy something that looks like a cross between the Batmobile and a beetle. The shadow of an initial attempt, which ended in bankruptcy, hangs over the founders as they gear up to launch their new product.But the Aptera's creators, Chris Anthony and Steve Fambro, think the world needs a car like theirs. Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming pollution in the United States. The Biden administration has made it a priority to reduce vehicle emissions, and several major automakers have pledged to phase out cars and light trucks with internal combustion engines.After years of dreaming, maybe the time for driving on sunshine is finally here.- - -Anthony and Fambro didn't set out to build a vehicle that could run on solar power. They just wanted to make a more efficient car.Burning gasoline, it turns out, is not a very efficient way to travel; as much as four-fifths of the energy produced by an internal combustion engine is lost as heat, wasted overcoming wind resistance or used up by fuel pumps and other components, according to Energy Department data.All-electric vehicles perform much better, but they're still not perfect. About 10 percent of the energy that goes into them is lost converting alternating current from the electrical grid into direct current for the battery. Inefficiencies in the drive system eat up another 20%, and the car must still deal with wind resistance and friction, through regenerative braking systems can reduce some waste.From top to wheels, the Aptera is designed to eliminate as much waste as possible. Its creators say the car is 13 times more efficient than a gas-powered pickup truck and four times more efficient than the average electric vehicle. At least 90% of the power produced by the Aptera's solar panels goes toward making the vehicle move, the company says.- - -The Aptera can be recharged the same way a standard electric vehicle is fueled - by simply plugging it into an outlet. Its extreme efficiency means the car can go 150 miles after just 15 minutes at an ordinary charging station.But an average electric car would need a solar panel ""the size of a semi truck"" to go farther than a few miles, Fambro said. Meanwhile, a relatively small number of solar cells can propel the Aptera.""It only works if you have a super-efficient vehicle,"" Fambro said. But once he and Anthony realized how far the sun alone could take them, ""there was no other plan than to make it a solar vehicle.""- - -When the first solar vehicle, the tiny Sunmobile, debuted at a General Motors trade show 65 years ago, even its inventors were skeptical about its prospects. GM officials told the magazine Popular Mechanics their creation was of ""no practical application to the automotive industry at present.""But that challenge was exactly what appealed to Danish adventurer Hans Tholstrup. Feeling guilty for his fossil-fuel guzzling exploits - flying around the world, driving a speedboat around Australia - he wanted to do something to benefit the planet.In 1982, Tholstrup and racecar driver Larry Perkins unveiled the ""the Quiet Achiever"" - a boat-shaped, single-driver construction topped by a 90-square-foot solar array. A tiller served as the steering system, and the wheels and brakes were borrowed from a bicycle. Eating orange slices to stay hydrated and camping by the side of the road, they took 20 days to drive 2,560 miles across the Australian continent. Their average speed was 15 miles per hour.Tom Snooks, the project's coordinator, recalled Tholstrup comparing the journey to the flight of the Kittyhawk: impractical but inspirational, and a sign of advances to come. ""If it will motivate just one more idea and thought in the development of solar power,"" Tholstrup said, ""then the venture will have been well worthwhile.""In 1987, Tholstrup launched the ""World Solar Challenge"" to encourage others to improve upon his record. Soon solar races were springing up around the globe, attracting competition from car manufacturers and high school students alike. The vehicles evolved from Tholstrup's ""bathtub on wheels"" to bullet shapes to three-wheeled cars with curved, winglike solar arrays. By 2013 the World Solar Challenge introduced a ""cruiser class"" competition in an effort to spur development of more commercially viable vehicles.""It makes for a really fun design challenge,"" said University of Michigan mechanical engineer Neil Dasgupta, faculty adviser to the school's highly decorated solar car team. ""And we've made tremendous advances.""The team's 2017 vehicle, which placed second in the World Solar Challenge, weighed just 420 pounds and averaged almost 50 miles per hour.Solar cars have to be small and sleek, Dasgupta explained, because of inefficiencies in solar panels. Photovoltaic cells are limited in what wavelengths they can turn into electricity. They don't perform well when they get hot. Even the best solar panels only convert about 23% of the sunlight that hits them into energy. You can get much more power more quickly by simply plugging into a charging station.Total reliance on solar power also poses practical problems. It means the car can't be parked in a garage or under a tree. Once the battery is full, any additional energy that hits the solar panels is lost.""This is a niche kind of thing,"" said Timothy Lipman, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California at Berkeley. The Aptera, which seats two, wouldn't work for a large family, a commuter in cloudy Seattle, a plumber who has to lug around equipment.Advances in solar cars could benefit the broader automotive industry, Lipman said. They might lead to the development of lighter materials and make the case for greater efficiency in electric vehicles. Manufacturers could add solar panels to augment car batteries. Maybe the technology will find use at national parks and remote military installations.But Lipman thinks it will be difficult for sun-powered vehicles to find broad commercial success. A Chinese manufacturer was still seeking funding to produce its prototype when it ran into financial problems last year. The Dutch champions of the first ""cruiser class"" race in the World Solar Challenge launched their own start-up, Lightyear One, and aim to start deliveries of their large, four-wheel hatchback at the end of this year. Still, the Lightyear car's price tag, about $180,000, puts it out of reach of most buyers.Anthony and Fambro know how easy it is to fail. Four years after founding Aptera in 2006, they left the venture amid disagreement with other leadership - auto industry veterans who wanted to build a traditional four-wheeled vehicle to qualify for federal loans. But the money never materialized. The company was liquidated in 2011, and its intellectual property sold.Business analysts treated the collapse as a case study in the perils of launching an automotive start-up. Cars are more expensive to make than software. Federal regulations are difficult to navigate. Consumers are wary of change.But Aptera's inventors took a different lesson from that experience: ""The traditional design process doesn't allow for breakthroughs,"" Fambro said. ""Because anything that's a breakthrough is seen as something that's polarizing, and they don't allow polarizing things to exit the research clinic.""If the Aptera was going to succeed, they decided, they couldn't make compromises to satisfy a federal requirement or a market-research firm's recommendation. They had to be willing to be different.""That's the march of technology,"" Anthony said, before paraphrasing Apple founder Steve Jobs. ""People don't know what they need until you show it to them.""- - -After a decade spent pursuing other ventures, Aptera's creators bought back the company in 2019 and launched a crowdfunding campaign to restart development.Their timing was good. Electric batteries had gotten much cheaper and lighter. Solar cells had become more efficient. Advances in computing enabled the inventors to simulate the vehicles on their desktops, speeding up the design process. Even the constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic spurred creativity, Anthony said.When Aptera began taking preorders last December, it sold out of itsplanned first batch of 330 vehicles in 24 hours. Almost 7,500 people have now put down deposits for a car.One of them was Tyler Perkins, the 27-year-old assistant manager of a small airport in Oklahoma City. A technology buff who had been following the company since he was a teenager, he said he was drawn to the Aptera's ""funky, radical design"" and wanted to make a hopeful bet on tomorrow.""They're actually like, 'let's build a futuristic car, because if we don't do it no one will,' "" Perkins said. ""And that's how the future happens.""Concern about climate change already motivated Perkins to become a vegan and drive a hybrid. He wanted to switch to an electric vehicle, but his apartment building offers no charging station. Then the Aptera came on the market. Even without federal tax credits (which only go to four-wheeled electric vehicles) it costs almost $10,000 less than other EVs. Sure it's small, but all he needs is space for himself and his camping gear.""I think it will work great for me,"" Perkins said, ""as someone who is trying to be as efficient as possible and have a minimal impact on the environment.""Not every Aptera fan fits the stereotype of an avid environmentalist. Nick Field, a 36-year-old accountant in London, is drawn more to the car's long range and high performance; it can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and hit top speeds of 110 mph. As far as he's concerned, the Aptera's low climate impact is just a fringe benefit.""I'm in the category of, 'I want to enjoy my life,' "" Field said. ""I just like fast cars. . . . I think it's really cool.""Anthony acknowledged that the Aptera is not for everyone. But it has more appeal than its skeptics give it credit for, he said. The car's high efficiency means it puts less demand on the grid than ordinary electric vehicles. It could be ideal for delivery trucks and Postal Service vehicles, which don't travel far and spend lots of time idling. Outdoor enthusiasts will probably like the option to venture far from charging infrastructure without worrying about fuel. And the notion of parking an Aptera in the sun and returning to a car that has more fuel than when you left it - free, clean fuel - is a powerful idea at a time when the world is looking for transformation.""We see solar as the main driver of our business,"" Anthony said. ""It enables so many things.""He considered the dreamers who first conceived of solar cars: Tholstrup subsisting on orange slices during his cross-continent journey, engineering students building racecars after school. He thought about the early developers of electric vehicles, who had faith in a future that didn't run on gas. He remembered the investors who shied away from the Aptera's first incarnation, saying ""who is going to buy your weird egg-shaped creation?""""It's the same thing with anybody who does anything first,"" Anthony said. ""It's always: Why would you do that?""When Aptera hits the road, he'll have his answer.Read More Amazon's new rotating, follow-you camera is useful - and invasiveAgainst advice, Mexico prioritizes rural poor in vaccination effortLibya risks losing control of its destiny as planeloads of fighters and arms flood the countrySubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post."
302,SolarWinds Officials Blame Intern for ‘solarwinds123’ Password,Security,https://gizmodo.com/solarwinds-officials-throw-intern-under-the-bus-for-so-1846373445,"The SolarWinds drama just won’t stop. It’s a tale of Russian hackers’—and potentially Chinese hackers’—alleged email spying, and a gaping hole of security vulnerabilities that seems to get worse as more details come to light. Now, we can add yet another twist to the story: the laughably insecure password “solarwinds123.” In this last case, SolarWinds would like you to know that it was the intern’s fault. Apparently not content with having penetrated the networks of such piddling federal agencies as the In a joint hearing on Friday, former SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson told representatives from the House Oversight and Homeland Security Committees that the “solarwinds123” password, which protected a server at the company, was “related to a mistake an intern made, and they violated our password policies.” Thompson explained to lawmakers that the intern had posted the password on their own private GitHub account.“As soon as it was identified and brought to the attention of my security team, they took that down,” Thompson said.The password security problem dates back to at least 2018, although testimony provided by SolarWinds on Friday indicates that it could go back even further. In December, security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that he warned SolarWinds that anyone could access its update server using “solarwinds123.” CNN reported that the password had been accessible online since at least June 2018. However, at the hearing, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds’ current CEO, told lawmakers that the “solarwinds123” password was used on one of the intern’s servers back in 2017.According to CNN, Kumar showed SolarWinds that the password allowed him to log in and deposit files on its server. This was a way for any hacker to upload malicious programs to SolarWinds, the researcher stated.“I’ve got a stronger password than ‘solarwinds123' to stop my kids from watching too much YouTube on their iPad,” Rep. Katie Porter, democrat of California, told SolarWinds officials at the hearing. At this point though, it’s still uncertain whether the password leak played a role in the SolarWinds hack, CNN noted, which is believed to be the largest foreign intrusion campaign in U.S. history. This month, White House national security adviser Anne Neuberger stated that approximately 100 different companies and nine federal agencies, including the one that oversees the country’s nuclear weapons, had been compromised by foreign hackers. The government is currently investigating the hack, and it’s still unclear what data hackers could have gotten access to. The investigation is expected to take several months. Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the hack, has said we may never know the scope of the attack.Now the Chinese are involved. That’s one of the newest allegations to  emerge in the SolarWinds…“The bottom line: We may never know the full range and extent of damage, and we may never know the full range and extent as to how the stolen information is benefitting an adversary,” Mandia said.Nonetheless, we do know one of the causalities of the attack: a poor unnamed intern that SolarWinds threw under the bus.Unless I’m missing something, I still see it as their fault. There are websites that won’t even allow me to use sequential numbers in a password and this company allows it for their servers lol. Also was the intern the only person to have access to the server/password? "

The police icon and message will appear next to a specific comment, informing both its author and the public that this is an illegal act and it must be stopped.”“The goal is to fight hate, racial and sexual crimes,” Požėla added.Interior Minister Agnė Bilotaitė later commented that there needed to be an effort against disinformation about Covid-19 vaccination.According to Bilotaitė, elderly Lithuanians are refusing to have AstraZeneca shots after reading misleading information about the vaccine.“We see a big challenge and a problem, namely, disinformation that is being spread in the public sphere, which does harm to people invited to get vaccinated.

304,"Young people have a popular pandemic pastime: Filling, then abandoning, e-commerce shopping carts",Business,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/pandemic-window-shopping-abandoning-e-commerce-shopping-carts.html,"In normal times, Amanda Ryczek window-shopped — wandering around with no intention to buy, but taking time to see new merchandise or thinking of what could be worn and where.As the Covid-19 pandemic shut down brick-and-mortar stores, the 27-year-old moved her habits online.""I'm definitely not going into stores in the present moment, and so, as far as going online, you go to the store's website and in some weird way it's almost like going to the store,"" Ryczek said.But instead of testing a lotion or feeling the fabric on a shirt, she'll hit ""add to cart"" — and then exit the window before checking out.The internet equivalent of window-shopping isn't new. People have been picking out items and abandoning carts for years. But the pastime appears to have increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, as consumers are in need of something to do and less willing to shell out money. It's ""definitely a pandemic thing,"" she added.Ryczek isn't alone. While describing their habit in interviews this month, people compared it to therapy, a replacement for browsing around a store, or just another way to pass time while stuck at home. Brenna Shepherd told CNBC that she's increased her time spent digital window shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, using it as a way to spend her days or procrastinate on school work.""My roommate, she gets money and spends it. I'm a very big saver so I think that's why I do this, because I don't like to spend my money,"" the 19-year-old college student said. ""But I do like clothes and looking at clothes and even on Amazon, looking at random things, but never actually purchase it.""The number of abandoned carts appears to have increased while consumers were home during the pandemic.Last June, Jordan Elkind, who, at the time, served as the VP of retail insights for customer data and identity platform Amperity, told Today that data from the onset of the pandemic showed a 94.4% cart abandonment rate, compared to 85.1% in the comparable period last year. That would equate to billions of dollars in forgone e-commerce revenue, he said.The trend of mindlessly scrolling online, adding items to a cart and then abandoning them isn't necessarily the worst thing for retailers, since they're getting eyeballs on products and those could lead to potential sales, explained Dennis Hegstad. His company, LiveRecover, helps e-commerce companies re-capture shoppers who've abandoned their carts by sending text message reminders to customers who get far enough into the checkout process to include a phone number.He suggested that people may just need to fill their time, so they go online window shopping, though ""it's a confusing symbol if somebody adds things to cart without that intent.""But some companies could also be paying for the advertisements that bring these online window shoppers in, and are not making that money back, Hegstad said.""Customers add items to carts on websites for lots of reasons aside from an intent to immediately buy. They use carts as wish lists, a place to hold items while they comparison shop, or a reminder to themselves for later,"" Forrester Senior Analyst Emily Pfeiffer told CNBC in an email. ""Retailers usually do not reserve those units or remove those items from inventory until orders are placed. So, although cart abandonment is something retailers address with re-marketing efforts in hopes of closing the sale, it is not a disastrous inventory management event that creates a frantic 'chase down' of customers.""As the pandemic wears on, more shoppers are actually finishing their purchases, suggesting that window-shopping is transitioning to the real thing.""As the pandemic has continued, e-commerce interactions have changed quite dramatically,"" Chris Chapo, vice president of advanced analytics at Amperity, said in an email. ""What we hear from our customers and conversations with many retail brands is that conversion rates are starting to increase even with dramatically more website traffic. While this may be counterintuitive, it's a positive indicator for the future of digital business. More than ever before, B2C (business-to-consumer) companies are going to need to focus on customer-centric engagement to super-charge this tailwind.""All of this comes as online retail sales jumped in the past year. Americans spent $791.7 billion online last year, up 32.4% from 2019, according to quarterly figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce this month. E-commerce also accounted for 14% of all U.S. sales, up from 11% in 2019.Research suggests that shopping — even hypothetical shopping — has psychological value, hence the term ""retail therapy.""""Every now and again you're going to cross something that really lights up that brain and excites you,"" Dr. Scott Bea, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said in an interview.For people who just add to cart, the anticipation of even just a potential reward (in this case, a package), releases dopamine. The dopamine then makes people want to continue to seek out things that make them feel good, so they'll repeat.""Just the hunting and shopping, without necessarily grabbing, it takes you away from the rest of the lives we're leading, kind of consuming us so the worries of our days kind of takes a backseat,"" Bea said. ""Because we have such restrictions, people are looking for ways to make their brain feel better.""For Nancy Duarte, a 22-year-old, online window shopping was a way to fill time after graduating college during a pandemic, a difficult climate to find work. Now that she has a job, she said she usually looks after work on weeknights as a ""treat.""Others said they view it as a way to get away from social media, while lingering on the internet just a little bit longer.""Online shopping without actually following through on a purchase, I think, is honestly a way to pass the time — just somewhere different to be online besides Twitter or reading the news or something else depressing,"" Jennifer Vance, 26, said in an email. ""And I think maybe just thinking about something new coming in the mail kind of simulates that same serotonin boost.""It's a similar case for Oreoluwa Temi.""I'd say it's been a coping mechanism, after scrolling through all the social media apps, you think -- 'let me browse through clothing websites and see what I like,'"" the 26-year-old said in an email, adding it's a new development. ""It's a little bit relaxing. Just scrolling through what you could buy if you had the money.""Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Got a confidential news tip?

305,How U.S. manufacturers were hobbled by a shortage of tiny silicon chips,Business,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/,"Semiconductor executive Tom Caulfield knew a crisis was brewing when he started getting frantic calls from big automakers just before Christmas.“Tom, you’re killing me. You need to make more,” Caulfield, the chief executive of chipmaker GlobalFoundries, recalls the auto executives saying. “Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler-Benz, Fiat Chrysler, GM — every one of them became my new best friends.”The Santa Clara, Calif.-headquartered company did its best to ramp up production for car manufacturers at its three big factories in the United States, Germany and Singapore, Caulfield said in an interview. But its efforts alone couldn’t fix a supply problem that had been building for months as an unprecedented surge of demand far outstripped supplies across the globe, leaving manufacturers of all kinds in the lurch.What you need to know about the global chip shortageThe shortages have forced General Motors and Ford to slash production in three states as well as in Canada and Mexico, threatening jobs at the auto companies and their suppliers. The White House has already leaned on big chip producers and their host nations, including Taiwan, to increase output, but on Friday, governors from eight states urged President Biden to “redouble those efforts,” warning of a “growing list of automakers, suppliers, and dealers negatively affected by the shortage.”Growing computer-chip shortage alarms Biden and CongressSemiconductors are the brains behind an ever increasing range of products, from vacuum cleaners and refrigerators to computers and space shuttles. The average automobile contains dozens of the integrated circuits, controlling air bags, power windows, catalytic converters and dashboard displays.Many of the factors contributing to the shortfall are tied to recent events like the pandemic and the cold snap that slapped Texas and sidelined two chip factories in Austin. But the growing presence of chips in devices large and small foreshadows a supply problem not easily resolved by warmer weather or presidential executive orders. New semiconductor factories are among the most complex manufacturing facilities to build, costing billions of dollars and taking years to construct.That means much of the world’s electronics industry will continue to depend heavily on existing factories, many of them in Taiwan — a reliance that critics say looks increasingly risky as the island’s tensions with China rise. One Taiwanese company, TSMC, produces 70 percent of the global auto industry’s supply of a key type of chip called a microcontroller, according to research firm IHS Markit.“You have an entire global electronics supply chain that is dependent on Taiwan, and it’s 100 miles offshore of China,” said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst at the financial services firm AllianceBernstein. “Given everything going on with geopolitical tensions, that’s becoming a strategically untenable position.”That has helped spark bipartisan calls for government subsidies to encourage construction of more chip factories in the United States, which today hosts 12 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing.The supply pinch has hit auto manufacturers particularly hard because they use many chips designed years ago that are lower-priority items for semiconductor makers. Those chips yield lower profit margins than the newer, pricier semiconductors that power 5G smartphones and video games, which are also in high demand worldwide and dominate many manufacturing lines.The global auto industry will produce 1.5 million to 5 million fewer vehicles this year than originally planned because of the supply constraints, according to the consulting firm AlixPartners. Some analysts predict that could raise auto costs for consumers and threaten jobs in a sector that employs hundreds of thousands of Americans.The roots of the shortage lie in the early weeks of the pandemic, when auto plants worldwide abruptly shut down amid widespread stay-at-home orders. Auto sales fell by almost half between February and April. As a result, car companies and their parts suppliers drastically cut their semiconductor purchases.At the same time, demand for computers and other electronics soared as consumers tried to make their new work-from-home lifestyles palatable by bingeing on monitors, laptops and entertainment devices. So manufacturers of those items stepped up their chip purchases.“It comes down to capacity,” said Shawn DuBravac, chief economist of IPC, an electronics industry association. “Semiconductor manufacturers weren’t getting orders from auto manufacturers. They were getting orders from other industries, so they started to reallocate production.”Auto sales recovered faster than expected, as China’s economy bounced back and as consumers everywhere sought to avoid public transportation. By September, annualized sales figures reached 97 percent of the pre-pandemic volume.As automakers tried to place chip orders again, however, they found their suppliers busy making components for electronics companies. Switching manufacturing lines from one type of chip to another is a lengthy process that companies don’t undertake lightly.Biden orders sweeping review of U.S. supply chain weak spotsOther factors compounded the problem. An Oct. 21 blaze disrupted production at a Japanese chip factory, while the recent cold snap in Texas knocked two semiconductor plants in Austin offline.The owner of those factories, NXP Semiconductors, says it is working to restore production as soon as possible, but auto industry executives say that supply may not resume till late March. NXP declined to confirm that date.Even U.S. sanctions limiting chip sales to Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE played a role, said Bindiya Vakil, chief executive of Resilinc, a maker of supply chain management software.The sanctions kicked off a domino effect as the Chinese giants stockpiled chips, prompting others to do the same.“A lot of companies started to hoard,” she said. “When large players like this make large moves, they have a ripple effect on others.”Taiwan and its biggest chip maker, TSMC, are now under pressure from all sides to boost output. In a Feb. 17 letter, Biden’s top economic adviser, Brian Deese, thanked Taiwan’s economics minister, Wang Mei-Hua, for her efforts to resolve the chip shortage for automakers.“We see significant potential for broader engagement over the medium-to-longer term to enhance supply chain resilience,” Deese wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Washington Post and reported earlier by Bloomberg News. “We also look forward to working closely with you on the broader U.S.-Taiwan economic relationship,” Deese said.A TSMC spokeswoman pointed to the company’s Jan. 28 statement that called addressing the auto chip shortage “our top priority.”“While our capacity is fully utilized with demand from every sector, TSMC is reallocating our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry,” the statement said.Car manufacturers began using electronics to control automobiles in the 1970s, replacing older mechanical controls. Gradually, the number of tiny chips known as microcontrollers increased inside cars, powering a wide array of functions, from lights to engine cooling systems.The 38 microcontrollers in an Audi Q7 come from eight companies, highlighting the complexity of auto supply chains, according to research firm IHS Markit.Yet because TSMC manufactures nearly three-quarters of all auto microcontrollers, any capacity crunch at the company has ripple effects through the entire auto industry.The most modern chips feature ever smaller transistors, measured by their width in nanometers, a unit that itself shows just how small these devices are. (It takes 25.4 million nanometers to equal an inch.) In general, the smaller the nanometer number, the smarter and faster the chip is, and the more expensive and difficult it is to make. Auto chips don’t tend to contain the latest nanometer technology.Most semiconductor companies have focused their capital investments in recent years on the latest, high-tech chips, leaving insufficient investment in production capacity for more mature chips, Caulfield said.Car companies are often slow to update their components because they undergo lengthy internal checks to ensure safety and durability. Switching to more modern chips would improve their access to supply but would cost more money and require lengthy revalidation of parts, said Ambrose Conroy, founder of Seraph Consulting, which is advising two automakers on the chip shortage.“They don’t want to spend the money to revalidate chips and change things within the vehicle, but they know they have to,” he said, adding that cars “are increasingly becoming computer electronics devices.”U.S. restricts tech exports to China’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer in escalation of trade tensionsIn the short term, companies like Ford and General Motors can try to outbid electronics makers for scarce chips, analysts said.“Maybe you take a bigger wallet with you,” said Koray Kose, a senior supply chain analyst for Gartner.Caulfield said some auto companies are also trying to establish closer relationships with semiconductor manufacturers to ensure steady supply. Traditionally, car companies haven’t dealt directly with chip companies, leaving those relationships more to middleman suppliers.Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst with the market research firm Counterpoint, said the advent of 5G mobile connectivity has increased competition for chips.In addition to the sheer amount of demand for new phones, 5G handsets require two to four times more power management chips than 4G phones do because of the complexity of the wireless technology, he said. Those power management chips, which tell batteries when to send power and where, are also used in automobiles.The addition of more and more cameras to smartphones — the latest Samsung phone has five — also requires more display chips, which are also needed in automobiles for backup cameras, infotainment screens, driver assistance sensors and more.Some smartphone makers are already facing shortages, Fieldhack said. In parts of the country, prepaid phones and handsets from smaller companies like Alcatel, OnePlus and Motorola are in short supply, he said.It’s unlikely, though, that Apple or Samsung would face similar problems, Fieldhack said.“The Apples and Samsungs of the world are so big and powerful,” he said, that chip suppliers put them at the front of the list. “The weaker and smaller get pushed to the back of the line for sure.”Pressure grows on Biden to end the filibusterSenate launches debate on Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus as lawmakers plan amendmentsTransgender rights emerge as a growing political flash pointThe Biden Cabinet: Who has been selected Biden appointees: Who is filling key rolesRead more about his plans on: Immigration | Foreign policy | Health care | Climate change | Social and Criminal Justice | Economic policy | Tech policyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"
306,Fossil fuel cars make 'hundreds of times' more waste than electric cars,Energy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/01/fossil-fuel-cars-make-hundreds-of-times-more-waste-than-electric-cars,"Analysis by transport group says battery electric vehicles are superior to their petrol and diesel counterpartsLast modified on Tue 2 Mar 2021 12.06 GMTFossil fuel cars waste hundreds of times more raw material than their battery electric equivalents, according to a study that adds to evidence that the move away from petrol and diesel cars will bring large net environmental benefits.Only about 30kg of raw material will be lost over the lifecycle of a lithium ion battery used in electric cars once recycling is taken into account, compared with 17,000 litres of oil, according to analysis by Transport & Environment (T&E) seen by the Guardian. A calculation of the resources for each relative to their weight shows internal combustion engines burn material 300 times greater than that lost once an electric car battery is scrapped. The comparison did not include potential emissions if fossil fuels were burned to create the power for recharging of car batteries.“Our previous analysis has shown that that electric vehicles emit 64% less CO2, including all the different stages like electricity generation and fuel production, but this still hasn’t shaken off the argument that electric vehicles use up a large amounts of raw materials,” said Lucien Mathieu, a transport analyst at T&E and an author of the report. “Our analysis shows that the raw material needs of EV batteries pale in comparison to the fuel burned by fossil fuel cars, which, unlike batteries cannot be recycled.”In the fossil engine/battery calculations, “we excluded the raw material needed to produce the electricity and the [fossil] fuel because this is contingent on factors such as national electricity mixes and fuel extraction efficiency. In our analysis of upstream energy use [producing the electricity and making the solar panels and turbines used to produce that electricity], we have shown that it would only make a 5% to 10% difference in total energy consumption” for electric vehicles powered by renewable energy.On other aspects of the two vehicle types, the Brussels-based campaign group said battery electric vehicles were superior to their petrol and diesel counterparts across raw material demand, energy efficiency or cost – as well as eliminating exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases.The accelerating move to electric vehicles will entail environmental costs. Higher battery production will require more mining of minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.However, T&E argued that the cost of oil extraction for fuel represents a much greater environmental toll. The report pointed to a “double standard” used when assessing the relative merits of electric and fossil fuel vehicles, which takes the use of oil for granted.“When it comes to raw materials there is simply no comparison,” said Mathieu. “Over its lifetime, an average fossil-fuel car burns the equivalent of a stack of oil barrels 25 storeys high. If you take into account the recycling of battery materials, only around 30kg of metals would be lost – roughly the size of a football.”Developments in battery technology will reduce the average amount of lithium, nickel and cobalt required for each car, mitigating some of the increased demand for the materials as well as lowering car prices. At the same time, circular economy regulations requiring higher recycling rates could cut demand further.On the overall energy efficiency of vehicles, T&E calculations suggest that battery electric cars will use 58% less energy than a petrol car over its lifetime and emit 64% less carbon dioxide. Emissions associated with electric cars are mainly produced in the energy-intensive manufacturing of batteries, while the vast majority of emissions associated with internal combustion engine cars come from its use.Some makers of internal combustion engines have argued for the merits of cutting emissions through hybrids that combine batteries with petrol engines, in part because of the emissions associated with producing batteries. However, Aston Martin faced a backlash last year after a report making similar claims – that the large amount of carbon used to make electric car batteries undermined the case for a switch away from petrol – was attributed to a PR company registered to the wife of a director at the UK carmaker. This article was updated on 2 March 2021 to include an explanation from T&E as to why its battery/engine comparison excluded energy to charge the battery, and its estimate of how much the outcome would have changed had this been included."

The lawsuit claimed that Facebook’s Tag Suggestions tool, which scanned faces in users’ photos and offered suggestions about who the person might be, stored biometric data without users’ consent in violation of the Illinois law. The case became a class action lawsuit in 2018. In 2019, Facebook made facial recognition on the platform opt-in only.The three named plaintiffs in the suit will each receive $5,000 and others in the class will get at least $345 each, according to the order by Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California. Donato said the settlement was a “landmark result” and a “major win for consumers in the hotly contested area of digital privacy.” “We are pleased to have reached a settlement so we can move past this matter, which is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders,” Facebook said in a statement. “It’s a big deal,” Edelson told The Chicago Tribune. “It sends a pretty clear message that in Illinois, biometric privacy rights are here to stay.”A newsletter about computers"

With COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out in regions globally, the race for applying solutions to aid in the “return to normal” is in full swing. Yet at the current pace, it will take years to fully immunize the planet against the virus. Given the long-term reality of living within a pandemic, the public and private sectors are forging ahead to create a source of record indicating a person’s COVID-19 immunity.Digital vaccine immunity certificates, or “vaccine passports,” are an emerging technology that holds great promise for documenting whether an individual carries COVID-19 antibodies. However, obstacles also stand in the way of wide-scale adoption. Here’s what business leaders need to know about digital vaccine certifications and the questions that must be answered before they can use this technology to pave the way to the new normal.What is a digital vaccine passport?The idea of a vaccine passport is not a new one. The World Health Organization (WHO) first established certification standards in 1933 and has issued paper medical passports ever since. They are known as “yellow cards” for the yellow fever immunizations required for entry to many regions. This documentation is not limited to travel; employers in some industries (e.g., healthcare) have required that employees submit vaccination status for diseases such as measles and rubella, and schools have required immunization documentation for years.Now, organizations are forging ahead on digital solutions as a fast and scalable version of this documentation in order to reopen economies and travel routes. In mid-January, a coalition of large tech and health companies launched the Vaccine Credential Initiative to create a system for storing and retrieving digital records of vaccinations. In the same time frame, the WHO launched a digital health working group to develop a framework and standards for a smart digital vaccine certificate for yellow fever and COVID-19, paving the way to add other vaccines later.Meanwhile, airlines have already been getting on board with solution trials. Qantas has said that proof of vaccination will be required to take a seat on one of its planes, while United and Cathay Pacific began a pilot project in October 2020 on select routes using CommonPass -- a QR code that contains COVID-19 testing and vaccination data.These high-profile efforts increase the potential that vaccine passports will become a reality, even as important questions remain, including the technology vaccine passports will use, the source and verification of data and definitions of immunity among them.The uncertainties of vaccine passportsAs these vaccine passports become more developed and used at scale, many business leaders are considering them as part of a return to work plan. However, it’s important to understand some of the significant uncertainties surrounding this emerging technology. Key questions that vaccine passport developers are looking to answer include:Fortunately, organizations don’t have to wait for answers to all of these questions to begin considering if and how they will use vaccine passports. As the answers become clearer over time, they will be critical for helping leaders determine later use case scenarios. What society needs to achieve wide-scale useFor a digital vaccine passport solution to work, it must be widely adopted. Given the above challenges, organizational leaders considering using vaccine passports must buy in to governance frameworks that allow for the acquisition, equity, verification and sharing of immunization data.At a high-level, a digital vaccine passport must enable consent-based COVID-19 vaccination records to be accessed in a secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving way. It must work across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries and be built on international standards and in a secure, decentralized infrastructure. Data standardization, in terms of what data is acquired, how it’s formatted and how it’s exchanged, is critical.One important consideration for organizational leaders thinking about utilizing vaccine passports as part of the return to work is that it could scare some people away from seeking a vaccine: They may have concerns over privacy or simply not want to bother with the extra steps involved. Consequently, employers and authorities should give special consideration to policies and education surrounding this technology.While many questions remain about vaccine passports, the outlook appears promising. Data-driven applications have already provided significant aid in addressing the pressing, global scenarios spurred by the pandemic. By understanding the current vaccine passport landscape, executive leaders can start planning now for other newer scenarios that could emerge in coming months and years -- return to work, travel requirements, and more. Investigating this technology in the near-term will enable organizations to alter plans and strategies based on new COVID-19-related information over time and stand prepared to leverage this solution in paving the road to the new normal.

312,Massachusetts groups back expanded carbon tax with focus on equity,Politics,https://energynews.us/2021/03/02/northeast/massachusetts-groups-back-expanded-carbon-tax-with-focus-on-equity/,"Energy News NetworkMassachusetts climate and justice advocates are endorsing new legislation they say would create more than half a billion dollars in annual revenue for climate action while protecting lower-income households from added energy costs.Most of the money under the Green Future Act (HD 1972) would come from closing what some advocates call a “pollution fee loophole” — extending an existing carbon fee requirement for power plants to also include transportation and heating fuels, which account for 74% of the state’s emissions.The change would generate between $500 million and $750 million per year, say supporters of the proposal. The money would be split between direct payments to lower-income households, a fund to assist displaced fossil fuel workers, and awards to cities and towns for projects that would reduce carbon emissions, either directly or indirectly.“It’s pretty comprehensive in terms of not only trying to drive the policy change but also putting a revenue source behind it,” said the bill’s sponsor, state Rep. William Driscoll Jr. “It helps to lay out the path forward to how we’re going to decarbonize.”Massachusetts is already in the midst of an intensive conversation about the state’s climate future. In December, Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration released its decarbonization roadmap, a strategic document laying out broad steps the state needs to take to achieve its goal of going carbon-neutral by 2050. The governor and the legislature are also deep in discussions about how to make a comprehensive climate bill acceptable to all parties.Against this background, Driscoll’s bill attempts to offer a concrete vision for how to fund the state’s climate priorities and goals. The bill is an elaboration on previously proposed carbon pricing legislation. Earlier bills called for placing an additional fee on all fossil fuel use in the state, but offered few details about what that carbon price would look like or how the revenue would be invested. The new proposal, on the other hand, lays out more detailed guidelines for how funds should be used and how the program would be designed and administered.“It really provides a wonderful, thoughtful framework to not only reduce emissions but to increase economic activity,” said Jen Benson, president of the Alliance for Business Leadership and a former Massachusetts state representative who put forth her own carbon pricing bills during her time in the legislature. “It’s going to be a plus for the Massachusetts economy.”Today, the state participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which requires power plants to pay for every ton of carbon dioxide they produce. There is not any similar assessment for transportation or heating fuels. The Green Future Act would require the state to close that gap by charging the transportation and heating fuel sectors for their emissions as well.Massachusetts is already part of a regional collaboration of 12 states and Washington, D.C. that is developing a market-based system to put a price on transportation emissions. The bill would require the state to create a fee for transportation fuels even if the current initiative does not come to fruition. The legislation also calls for a new green bonding program, which would allow, though not require, legislators to authorize up to $500 million per year for projects related to the state’s climate goals. The bill lays out a system for spending the money in a way that aims to prioritize equity for often marginalized groups, including low-income and non-white populations. To promote this goal, they reached out to several organizations that do environmental justice work and asked them to share their concerns about the possible pitfalls of the legislation. “I want there always to be the centering of Black and Brown voices, the ones that are closest to the pain, to ensure that this is something equitably and actually meeting the needs of the people instead of just assuming what would be the best thing for them,” said Tanisha Arena, executive director of Arise for Social Justice in Springfield, one of the organizations consulted during the process.The bill proposes a system of “green dividends,” direct cash payments made to households with income in the bottom 40% to help them deal with any short-term costs incurred by the transition into the new system. Much of the remaining money would be awarded each year to cities and towns that elect to participate and form a local climate crisis council to oversee the use of the money. The legislation calls for these councils to include members that reflect the socioeconomic, racial, age, and gender demographics of the municipality. Neighborhoods with high percentages of residents who are low-income, non-white, or have limited proficiency in English would need to be represented on the councils.The sum each town receives would be determined by a formula that takes population and equity into account. Environmental justice communities would receive roughly 60% of the total funds. Lawrence, Brockton, and Quincy, smaller cities with high environmental justice populations, would receive around $3 million annually. Boston could see $23 million per year.Municipalities would be given wide latitude in deciding what projects to undertake. The bill specifically mentions possibilities such as energy efficiency investments, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and community microgrids, but communities can pursue any initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or help the community adapt to climate change.“It’s not prescribing certain amounts to specific programs,” said Tim Cronin, Massachusetts state director for Climate XChange, one of the organizations involved in drafting and advocating for the bill. “It creates a broad framework for how the money can be spent to achieve these goals.”Many cities and towns are already creating ambitious climate change plans, said Cameron Peterson, director of clean energy for the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, a regional planning agency that serves the greater Boston area. The bill’s approach to funding individual municipalities would provide a much needed influx of money for these efforts, she said. “They are really taking action on this, but the funding that exists is really insufficient to meet the need and demand that’s out there,” she said.In addition to helping reach the state’s decarbonization goals, these funds would be expected to boost the economy and create as many as 80,000 new jobs by 2030, according to supporters. The legislation also calls for the creation of a green workforce fund and commission that would be tasked with helping fossil fuel workers find training and employment opportunities during the transition to a clean energy economy. Part of the fund would also provide temporary financial assistance to affected workers. No action had yet been taken on the bill. There has been growing appetite for carbon pricing legislation in recent years, but there is also the possibility that the legislature will pass the climate bill currently under negotiation with the administration then feel they’ve already addressed the climate change problem, said Benson, the former state representative. Passing the Green Future Act will require supporters to make a clear and convincing case for what the bill can add to existing approaches, she said. “The challenge for Rep. Driscoll and the coalition working on this is really going to be explaining how this already fits into what they’ve already done but also enhances those efforts,” Benson said. Sarah is a longtime journalist who covers business, technology, sustainability, and the places they all meet.

The nanobeads in the chip bind to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, a biomarker for COVID-19, and transport it to an electrochemical sensor that detects minute amounts of the biomarker.The research has been published in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Sensors.By combining existing biosensing tools and with the researchers’ experience of developing diagnostic tools such as microneedle patches, the team has developed the chip that can detect the N protein in low concentrations – at 10 picograms per millilitre – in only 25 minutes.Although the chip relies on a more complex detection scheme, the researchers say that longer incubation time yields more accurate results when using whole serum, with the team finding that 55 minutes was an optimum amount of time for the microchip to sense the protein at concentrations as low as 50 picograms (billionths of a gram) per millilitre in whole serum. To detect the N protein at 10 picograms per millilitre, the team diluted the serum fivefold.Paired with a smartphone and a plug-in potentiostat, the chip was able to deliver a positive diagnosis with a concentration as low as 230 picograms for whole serum.Lillehoj said: “There are standard procedures to modify the beads with an antibody that targets a particular biomarker. When you combine them with a sample containing the biomarker, in this case, SARS-CoV-2 N protein, they bond together.”The researchers say this simplified process of testing is easily transportable and can be done entirely away from a lab, with results able to be generated on collection sites, health clinics, or pharmacies.The sample is delivered to the chip through a capillary tube, then the chip is placed on a magnet which pulls the beads towards an electrochemical sensor coated with capture antibodies. The beads bind to the capture antibodies and generate a current proportional to the concentration of biomarker in the sample, which is then read by the potentiostat which sends a signal to its phone app.Lillehoj says it would be easy to manufacture the microfluidic chips or adapt them to new COVID-19 strains.Source: healtheuropa.euYou must be logged in to post a comment.

Aspiring electric truck maker Nikola has admitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission that nine statements made by founder Trevor Milton were ""inaccurate."" Milton was forced to resign from Nikola in September, shortly after the falsehoods first came to light.Between 2016 and 2020, Milton told a series of whoppers about his fledgling truck maker. At a 2016 press event, Milton took to the stage to unveil a prototype of the company's first truck, dubbed the Nikola One. During the event, Milton claimed that the truck ""fully functions."" In reality, Nikola never got the truck to move under its own power.Nikola's most infamous flimflam came in 2018, when the company released a video of the Nikola One ""in motion."" In reality, Nikola had towed the inoperative truck to the top of a long, shallow incline and rolled it down, angling the camera so that it looked like it was driving on level ground.These and several other misstatements came to light in September after a short-selling firm called Hindenburg Research published a report declaring Nikola to be a ""massive fraud."" In response, Nikola commissioned the law firm of Kirkland and Ellis to examine Hindenburg's allegations. While the resulting report hasn't been made public, Nikola has now copped to nine inaccurate statements prior to Milton's September 2020 departure. They include:Nikola now admits that these statements ""were inaccurate in whole or in part, when made.""Nikola says Kirkland and Ellis hasn't decided whether the company violated any laws when it made these misstatements. The firm's investigation is ongoing.Nikola says it could still face serious legal consequences for these misstatements. Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission both took an interest in the situation last September. Nikola says it can't predict how those investigations will turn out. Nikola has incurred $8 million in legal fees under an indemnification agreement with Trevor Milton.At the same time, Nikola argues that the main thesis of the Hindenburg report—that Nikola was a ""massive fraud,"" is not accurate. Milton really was trying to build a viable hydrogen trucking business, however incompetently. While he wildly exaggerated Nikola's capabilities, he also hired experienced engineers to work on its products. Before his departure, Milton forged deals with companies that really do know how to design and build trucks.So while Nikola's new management is trying to move past Milton's antics, they've carried forward with the most promising aspects of the founder's strategy. Indeed, when it released its quarterly financial results this week, Nikola said that it has completed assembly of five prototypes of its Nikola Tre battery electric truck in partnership with IVECO, an Italian truck maker. Nikola says that it's working with IVECO to build a manufacturing facility in Germany, with trial production slated to begin in June. Nikola is also building a truck factory in Arizona that it hopes will begin manufacturing trucks later this year.Nikola says it will get trucks into the hands of customers before the end of the year. In a Thursday conference call, the company said that there continues to be strong demand for its battery electric trucks.Nikola also said that its hydrogen electric trucks are on track for a planned 2023 release date. The company recently announced an electricity supply deal with an Arizona electric utility that will help Nikola produce hydrogen fuel at a low cost for its planned network of hydrogen fuel stations.Nikola was able to get a rock-bottom price for electricity because hydrogen production can be suspended during hot summer afternoons. That's valuable to electric utilities because they have to spend a lot of money ensuring that they have enough capacity during periods of peak demand. A customer who commits to consuming zero power during periods of peak demand adds very little cost, allowing them to get a great deal. Nikola says it is hoping to secure similar deals in other states.In short, Nikola's new management really is trying to turn Nikola into a viable truck company. They've jettisoned the most ridiculous parts of Milton's vision—like the Badger pickup truck—and are focusing on the more viable aspects.But the clock is ticking. Nikola lost almost $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and has $840 million in the bank. So the company is going to need to raise more money before too long. And to do that, the company's leaders need to convince investors that they have put Milton's chicanery in the past and are now running a normal company with a viable business strategy. It's not clear if they're going to make it. But they're trying.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

317,A New Internet Law Has People Worried And The Australian Government Isn't Listening,Politics,https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/03/a-new-internet-law-has-people-worried-and-the-australian-government-isnt-listening/,"In case you were worried the passing of the news media bargaining code would mean that politicians would stop paying attention to the internet, fear not! The Australian Government is already trying to pass new laws about the internet — despite unanswered concerns about the impact.Last February 24, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher introduced the Online Safety Act to Parliament, a long-mooted law that expands the powers of Australia’s eSafety Commissioner.For those unfamiliar, it’s a government-appointed position that grew out of the Children’s eSafety Commissioner into a broader role to deal with cyberbullying, image-based abuse and illegal or harmful online contentThe Online Safety Act considerably enhances the eSafety Commissioner’s powers. The reforms include: 
While there’s nothing to suggest that that the eSafety Commissioner has used her existing powers irresponsibly, this expansion of powers given to a single person in government calls for scrutiny.As such, the federal government called for feedback on its proposed law in December.In response, the Australian sex industry raised serious concerns that the law could essentially run them off the internet. 
Advocacy group Digital Rights Watch also have questioned the Acts’ expansion of the abhorrent violent material blocking scheme, it’s broad online safety expectations, and ability obtain information about users using encrypted services.How has the government responded to these concerns? By pushing forward with the bill despite concerns.Fletcher has put forward the bill, without releasing or responding to the submissions sought from the public. 
Fletcher’s office has been contacted for comment.“Both of the online safety bills have been developed following election commitments and substantial public and stakeholder consultation, including stakeholder workshops and an analysis of over 370 submissions received in response to an exposure draft of the Online Safety Bill that I released in December 2020,” Fletcher said in the second reading of the Bill on February 24.A day later, the Bill was referred to a Senate committee for further consultation for a single week, with a report due a week later — a speedy turnaround.While the eSafety Commissioner’s office has attempted to allay concerns by saying the laws in their current forms won’t be used to censor Australian sex workers, the fact is that the letter of the law allows it — and a future eSafety Commissioner could decide to use their powers in that way, if they were that way inclined.The Government’s decision to push forward and not even address concerns from people whose livelihoods depends on the internet doesn’t seem to align with their mission to protect Australians online.Submissions to the inquiry into the bill can be made here.Update March 1: This story has been updated to include details of the Senate committee inquiry into the Bill.

318,How a 10-second video clip sold for $6.6 million,Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-nfts-insight-idUSKCN2AT1HG,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Elizabeth Howcroft, Ritvik Carvalho7 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - In October 2020, Miami-based art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent almost $67,000 on a 10-second video artwork that he could have watched for free online. Last week, he sold it for $6.6 million.The video by digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was authenticated by blockchain, which serves as a digital signature to certify who owns it and that it is the original work.It’s a new type of digital asset - known as a non-fungible token (NFT) - that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scramble to spend enormous sums of money on items that only exist online.Blockchain technology allows the items to be publicly authenticated as one-of-a-kind, unlike traditional online objects which can be endlessly reproduced.“You can go in the Louvre and take a picture of the Mona Lisa and you can have it there, but it doesn’t have any value because it doesn’t have the provenance or the history of the work,” said Rodriguez-Fraile, who said he first bought Beeple’s piece because of his knowledge of the U.S.-based artist’s work.“The reality here is that this is very, very valuable because of who is behind it.”“Non-fungible” refers to items that cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis, as each one is unique - in contrast to “fungible” assets like dollars, stocks or bars of gold.Examples of NFTs range from digital artworks and sports cards to pieces of land in virtual environments or exclusive use of a cryptocurrency wallet name, akin to the scramble for domain names in the early days of the internet.The computer-generated video sold by Rodriguez-Fraile shows what appears to be a giant Donald Trump collapsed on the ground, his body covered in slogans, in an otherwise idyllic setting.OpenSea, a marketplace for NFTs, said it has seen monthly sales volume grow to $86.3 million so far in February, as of Friday, from $8 million in January, citing blockchain data. Monthly sales were at $1.5 million a year ago.“If you spend 10 hours a day on the computer, or eight hours a day in the digital realm, then art in the digital realm makes tonnes of sense - because it is the world,” said OpenSea’s co-founder Alex Atallah.Investors caution, however, that while big money is flowing into NFTs, the market could represent a price bubble.Like many new niche investment areas, there is the risk of major losses if the hype dies down, while there could be prime opportunities for fraudsters in a market where many participants operate under pseudonyms.(Graphic: Crypto asset sales surge, )CHRISTIE’S ‘EMBRACES TERRIFYING’Nonetheless, auction house Christie’s has just launched its first-ever sale of digital art – a collage of 5,000 pictures, also by Beeple – which exists solely as an NFT.Bids for the work have hit $3 million, with the sale due to close on March 11.“We are in a very unknown territory. In the first 10 minutes of bidding we had more than a hundred bids from 21 bidders and we were at a million dollars,” said Noah Davis, specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s.His division has never seen an online-only sale top $1 million before, he added.In a decision that could help push cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream, the auction house that was founded in 1766 will accept payment in the digital coin Ether as well as traditional money.“I think that this moment was inevitable and whenever institutions of any kind try to resist inevitability, it does not work out very well,” Davis said of accepting crypto payment. “And so the best thing you can do is embrace the terrifying.”NFTs could be benefiting from the hype around cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as well as virtual reality’s potential to create online worlds. The growing interest also coincides with a surge in online retail trading during lockdowns.The start of the rush for NFTs has been linked with the launch of the U.S. National Basketball Association’s Top Shot website, which allows users to buy and trade NFTs in the form of video highlights of games.Five months after its launch, the platform says it has over 100,000 buyers and nearly $250 million in sales. The majority of sales take place in the site’s peer-to-peer marketplace, with the NBA getting a royalty on every sale.The volume is rapidly rising: February has seen sales totalling $198 million as of Friday, heading for a fivefold increase from January’s $44 million, Top Shot said.Each collectible has “a unique serial number with guaranteed scarcity and protected ownership guaranteed by blockchain”, the site says. “When you own #23/49 of a legendary LeBron James dunk, you’re the only person in the world who does.”The biggest transaction to date was on Feb. 22, when a user paid $208,000 for a video of a LeBron James slam dunk.One major NFT enthusiast, who goes by the pseudonym “Pranksy” told Reuters he had invested $600 in an early NFT project in 2017 and has now built that up to a portfolio “worth seven figures” in NFTs and cryptocurrencies. He asked to be anonymous to protect his family’s privacy.Pranksy said he has now spent more than $1 million on Top Shot and made about $4.7 million by reselling purchases. Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures, although NBA Top Shot confirmed he is among the site’s biggest buyers.“I see them as investments really, much like any other collectibles and NFTs that currently exist,” he said in an interview conducted via Twitter. “I’d never watched a game of basketball before Top Shot launched.”‘EMERGENCE OF THE METAVERSE’Nate Hart, a Nashville-based NFT investor who, like Pranksy, has been involved in the market since it first developed in 2017, has seen some popular digital art NFTs such as Autoglyphs and CryptoPunk surge in value.Hart said he bought a LeBron James Cosmic NFT on NBA Top Shot for $40,000 in January, then sold it for $125,000 in February.“We’re in awe, it just doesn’t feel real. We were in the right place, right time, got lucky, but we also took that risk,” he said.“The space has been growing a lot. I do think that this is a little bit of a bubble. It is a bubble,” he said. “It’s hard to predict what the top will be.”Andrew Steinwold, who launched a $6 million dollar NFT investment fund in January, warned that the majority of NFTs could become worthless in future.But, like many backers, he is confident that some items will retain their value and that NFTs represent the future of digital ownership, paving the way for a world in which people live, socialise and make money in virtual environments.“We’re spending a lot of our time digitally, always online, always plugged in. It makes sense to now add property rights to the mix and suddenly we have the emergence of the metaverse,” he said.“I think it’s going to reach into the trillions of dollars one day.”Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Pravin CharOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

319,Japanese companies go high-tech in the battle against food waste,Business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-foodwaste/japanese-companies-go-high-tech-in-the-battle-against-food-waste-idUSKCN2AS0RI,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Tetsushi Kajimoto4 Min ReadTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies are ramping up the use of artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to reduce waste and cut costs in the pandemic, and looking to score some sustainability points along the way.Disposing of Japan’s more than 6 million tonnes in food waste costs the world’s No.3 economy some 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) a year, government data shows. With the highest food waste per capita in Asia, the Japanese government has enacted a new law to halve such costs from 2000 levels by 2030, pushing companies to find solutions.Convenience store chain Lawson Inc has started using AI from U.S. firm DataRobot, which estimates how much product on shelves, from onigiri rice balls to egg and tuna sandwiches, may go unsold or fall short of demand.Lawson aims to bring down overstock by 30% in places where it has been rolled out, and wants to halve food waste at all of its stores in 2030 compared with 2018.Disposal of food waste is the biggest cost for Lawson’s franchise owners after labour costs.Drinks maker Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd is experimenting with another AI product from Fujitsu Ltd to try to determine if goods such as bottles of oolong tea and mineral water have been damaged in shipping.Until now, that’s been a time-consuming human endeavour. With the new AI, Suntory hopes to gauge when a damaged box is just that, or when the contents themselves have been damaged and need to be returned.Suntory aims to reduce the return of goods by 30-50% and cut the cost of food waste and develop a common standard system that can be shared by other food makers and shipping firms.Japan’s notoriously fussy shoppers are showing signs of getting on board, especially as the coronavirus pandemic hits incomes.Tatsuya Sekito launched Kuradashi, an e-commerce firm dealing in unsold foods at a discount, in 2014 after seeing massive amounts of waste from food processors while working for a Japanese trading firm in China.The online business is now thriving due partly to a jump in demand for low-priced unsold foods as consumers became more cost conscious amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“Sales grew 2.5 times last year from a year before, while the amount of food waste has doubled since the coronavirus cut off food supply chain,” Sekito told Reuters.Kuradashi has a network of 800 companies, including Meiji Holdings Co, Kagome Co and Lotte Foods Co, who sell it a total 50,000 items including packs of instant curry, smoothies and high-quality nori.“Japanese shoppers tend to be picky but we attract customers by offering not just a sale but a chance to donate a portion of purchases to a charity, raising awareness about social issues,” Sekito said.Membership numbers jumped to 180,000 in 2021 from 80,000 in 2019.Others have also joined forces with food firms in developing new technological platform to cut food waste as part of global efforts to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs).NEC Corp is using AI that can not only analyse data such as weather, calendar and customers’ trends in estimating demand but also give reasoning behind its analysis.NEC has deployed the technology to some major retailers and food makers, helping them reduce costs by 15%-75%.NEC hopes to share and process data through a common platform among makers, retailers and logistics, to reduce mismatches in supply chains.“Reducing food waste is not our ultimate goal,” said Ryoichi Morita, senior manager overseeing NEC’s digital integration.“Eventually, we hope it can lead to resolve other business challenges such as minimizing costs, fixing labour shortages, streamlining inventory, orders and logistics.”Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Lincoln Feast.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

320,"In France, Apple now shows how hard its products are to repair",Hardware,https://mashable.com/article/apple-repairability-scores-france/,"Apple's products haven't typically been the easiest to repair, though the company is making progress on this front. But being able to repair a product (or at least have a third party professional do it) is an important part of the experience of owning that product, and now Apple is at least forced to acknowledge it. MacRumors (via MacGeneration) reports that Apple has started adding repairability scores to its products on its Apple Store website and app in France. The scores, ranging from 1 to 10, are based on criteria such as the availability of documentation, availability of parts, and ease of disassembly. 




Image:  apple
For example, the iPhone 12 has a score of 6.0; the iPhone 11 has a score of 4.6, and the M1 MacBook Air has a score of 6.5. The scores are similar to the ones given by gadget repair specialists at iFixit, though they're determined by Apple itself, based on guidelines of France's Ministry of Ecological Transition, and under the eye of the Fraud Prevention Directorate. A complete repairability sheet for Apple products in France is available here. SEE ALSO: How to hide your iPhone's unique name from apps (and why you should)Apple had to add the repairability scores under the new Right to Repair law in France. For now, these scores are only available in that country, but given that the European Parliament voted to support Right to Repair in the European Union last November, we might see the scores pop up in more European countries soon. Other smartphone companies, such as Xiaomi and Samsung, have already complied with the new rules. A list of all the devices' scores (sans Apple's, which apparently haven't been added yet) is available at this website. "
321,Kinky and absurd: The first AI-written play isn’t Shakespeare—but it has its moments,Machine Learning,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/kinky-and-absurd-first-ai-written-play-isn-t-shakespeare-it-has-its-moments,"Read our COVID-19 research and news.
  By Sofia MoutinhoFeb. 26, 2021 , 11:30 AMOne hundred years ago, a play by the Czech author Karel Čapek introduced the word “robot,” telling the story of artificial factory workers designed to serve humans. Now, in a metanarrative twist, a robot itself has written a play. And it premieres online today.“It’s a kind of futuristic Little Prince,” says dramatist David Košťák, who oversaw the script. Like the classical French children’s book, the 60-minute production—AI: When a robot writes a play—tells the journey of a character (this time a robot), who goes out into the world to learn about society, human emotions, and even death.The script was created by a widely available artificial intelligence (AI) system called GPT-2. Created by Elon Musk’s company OpenAI, this “robot” is a computer model designed to generate text by drawing from the enormous repository of information available on the internet. (You can test it here.) So far, the technology has been used to write fake news, short stories, and poems. The play is GPT-2’s first theater production, the team behind it claims.Here’s how it works: First, a human feeds the program with a prompt. In this case, the researchers—at Charles University in Prague—began with two sentences of dialogue, where one or two characters chat about human feelings and experiences. The first input they gave to the AI, for example, was: “Hello, I am robot and it is a pleasure to invite you to see a play I wrote.” The software then takes things from there, generating up to 1000 words of additional text.The result is far from William Shakespeare. After a few sentences, the program starts to write things that sometimes don’t follow a logical storyline, or statements that contradict other passages of the text. For example, the AI sometimes forgot the main character was a robot, not a human. “Sometimes it would change a male to female in the middle of a dialogue,” says Charles University computational linguist Rudolf Rosa, who started to work on the project 2 years ago.That happens because the program doesn’t really know the meaning of the sentences, says Chad DeChant, an AI expert at Columbia University. “It just puts together words that are likely to be used together, one after the other,” says DeChant, who was not part of the play but is curious to watch it. As it keeps going, there is more room for nonsense.To prevent that, the team didn’t let GPT-2 write the entire play at once. Instead, the researchers broke the show down into eight scenes, each less than 5 minutes; each scene also only contained a dialogue between two characters at the same time. In addition, the scientists sometimes changed the text, for example altering the passages where the AI changed the character’s gender from line to line or repeating their initial text prompt until the program spat out sensible prose. Rosa estimates that 90% of the final script was left untouched, whereas 10% had human intervention.Because the computer didn’t come up with the whole script itself, DeChant says he wouldn’t call the play “AI created.” He believes it will take about 15 years for the technology to be good enough to generate a complex and cohesive text like a theater play from beginning to end. But he thinks the experiment is still a nice way to show audiences what AI is currently able to do and “get people excited about it.”Rosa says the fact that the program is generating line after line of mostly intelligible writing is remarkable in of itself. “Ten years ago, you could only generate a sentence that looked like a sentence if you were really lucky.”Still, Košťák says the resulting text was tough for the actors to interpret, especially because the AI was not very good at staging the type of action and emotion needed to make a play work. “One of the actresses told me it was the most challenging work of her career,” he says.The play may be a challenge for the audience as well. Tomáš Studeník, a Czech entrepreneur and AI fan who came up with the idea for the project, notes a particular scene where a boy asks the robot to tell him a joke. The robot says that when the boy gets old and dies, and the boy’s children and grandchildren are also dead, he, the robot, will still be around. “It is funny and, at the same time, it sends shivers down your spine when a piece of metal is joking about your mortality,” Studeník says.The AI author was also a bit kinky. Košťák says sex and violence kept showing up in the script. In one of the scenes, an initial prompt about euthanasia ended up in a fight between characters about who had whose finger in whose anus.Don’t blame the computer, Košťák says. The AI only reflects what people have been writing about on the internet, without any filter or shame. “It is like a child that listens to his parents at home talking about something that they wouldn’t talk about in public,” he says. “Then the kid goes to school and starts to talk about it openly.”If you want to judge the play’s suitability for yourself, it debuts today at 1 p.m. EST. There will be English subtitles.doi:10.1126/science.abh2844

322,Lime's latest e-bike can borrow batteries from scooters | Engadget,Transportation,https://www.engadget.com/lime-e-bike-2021-swappable-battery-050109252.html,"Lime might have another way to make e-bikes more practical: have them use the same batteries as its scooters. The mobility service is rolling out a new e-bike whose battery is interchangeable with the one in Gen4 scooter models. That saves the company money, of course, but will also help with expansion plans that (with a $50 million investment) will help Lime double its bike coverage to 50 cities in 2021. The swappable battery should be better for the environment, too, if just because Lime's charging vans won't head out quite so often.There are functional improvements you'll notice on trips. A more powerful motor should help you climb steeper hills, and a phone holder saves you from having to stop whenever you need to check directions. An electric lock reduces the bike's weight, and the two-speed automatic transmission should lead to a smoother ride. You'll also see an updated handlebar display that matches what you find on Lime scooters.The hardware upgrade might have been necessary even if Lime wasn't planning an expansion. E-bike use has been thriving during the pandemic, with Lime touting 2.5 million rides in 2020. With demand expected to grow in 2021, that puts added strain on Lime — the easily swappable batteries ensure Lime can keep its bikes running, and might help if demand shifts toward one vehicle type in a given city. In other words, this simple change could play an important role in keeping Lime's business humming no matter what the future brings.Please enter a valid email address"

324,"Gab, a social platform favored by the far right, says it was hacked",Security,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/gab-social-platform-favored-far-right-says-it-was-hacked-n1259156,"SectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News The founder of the social media platform Gab said Sunday the far-right site had suffered a security breach, and lashed out at a group of anti-fascist activists who have begun to share a trove of the company's data they say includes private messages from about 15,000 users.A radical transparency group, Distributed Denial of Secrets, said in an announcement Monday that it acquired a trove of the Gab files, provided to them by an independent activist hacker whose name is not publicly known. The group said it is limiting distribution of the data to researchers and journalists because it includes sensitive and password information, but said that the files include more than 70,000 messages, with the bulk of them posted in recent weeks. NBC News has been in contact with the group and is reviewing the messages.The hack was first reported by Wired.Launched in 2016, Gab was one of the first so called “free speech” Twitter alternatives to gain a foothold among extremist, far-right and some mainstream conservative users as other platforms cracked down on hate speech and misinformation. The site has come under fire for its most extreme users — including white nationalists and neo-Nazis, one of whom posted to the site moments before killing 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.The hack echoes the woes that Parler, another site frequented by the far-right, has dealt with in recent weeks. After some of its users participated in the Capitol riot Jan. 6, Amazon suspended its web hosting service, saying it wasn’t moderating its users’ violent content. That rendered the site inoperable for several weeks while it searched for a new host.Gab’s founder, Andrew Torba, confirmed the hack in a message posted to Twitter on Sunday. ""The entire company is all hands investigating what happened,” he wrote.Gab has been named by groups like the Anti-Defamation League as an online headquarters for rioters who may have planned and organized January’s violence at the Capitol. Gab users posted enthusiastically in the days leading up to the Capitol rally. Some of these posts included calls for violence and tips for bringing weapons and avoiding police. Torba also encouraged users ahead of the rally to post footage on Gab.Torba previously told USA Today that Gab “put an immediate stop to a series of newly created accounts that were making threats of violence aimed at public officials,” but he also has suggested on Gab that it was police going easy on rioters and letting them in the Capitol grounds, not use of Gab, that was responsible. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.“Document as much as you can and please know that your content is safe on Gab and Gab TV,” he posted to Gab the day before the riot.Torba said that the site has seen a surge in user signups in the last month. The increase came as Parler faced a temporary shutdown in mid-January.Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News.Brandy Zadrozny is an investigative reporter for NBC News.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
325,Startup bets on artificial intelligence to counter misinformation,Business,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/540947-startup-bets-on-artificial-intelligence-to-counter-misinformation,"U.K.-based fact-checking startup Logically launched a new service Monday aimed at helping governments and nongovernmental organizations identify and counter online misinformation using a blend of artificial intelligence and human expertise.  The Logically Intelligence (LI) platform collects data from tens of thousands of websites and social media platforms then feeds it through an algorithm to identify potentially dangerous content and organize it into narrative groups.“Over the last few years, the phenomenon of mis- and disinformation has firmly taken root, evolved and proliferated, and is increasingly causing real world harm,” Lyric Jain, founder and CEO of Logically, said. “Our intensive focus on combating these untruths has culminated in the development of Logically Intelligence, based on several years of frontline operations fighting against the most egregious attacks on facts and reality.” The company views the service as a way to help institutions, including social media platforms, to be quicker to react to burgeoning misinformation narratives. Jain told The Hill that he hopes the platform will help information and intelligence sharing in the wake of the deadly insurrection at the Capitol earlier this year, which was planned in publicly-accessible online spaces but was seemingly missed by some authorities. “We think it's a really good time for us to be able to empower … individuals to national governments with something like Logically Intelligence,” he said in an interview, noting that the service could also help identify drivers behind coronavirus vaccine hesitancy. LI provides users with a customizable “Situation Room” that organizes potentially dangerous pieces of content and shows links between them. For example, the platform could chart how a particular concept traveled from a fringe platform to a mainstream social media site, helping the user figure out to block off falsehoods before they proliferate. It also identifies inauthentic accounts and can potentially be used to locate networks of them.  Logically touts its artificial intelligence and team of expert researchers as a differentiating factor that will help it be quicker and better at organizing content in useful ways. “What separates this from traditional social monitoring and internet monitoring tools is we then use all of the learning that we've done in terms of our artificial intelligence model, everything we’ve learned from our consumers products and projects we’ve worked on previous to this to then classify that content,” global head of product Joel Mercer explained.The platform also offers users several countermeasures once misinformation narratives have been detected, including investigative reports from Logically’s subject-matter experts, ways to flag content to platforms and built-in fact checks. LI has been tested with some government agencies over the last year. The company worked with an undisclosed battleground state during the 2020 American election to identify misinformation and coordinated activity that might hurt election integrity. It helped the state, according to Logically, push back on the false narratives by figuring out who was being targeted and boosting true information contradicting them through trusted local officials. The company has built in safeguards aimed at ensuring the LI platform is not misused. The company has a list of permissible use cases and plans to monitor how the tool is being applied.  Logically, which was founded in 2017, has previously worked on a service focused on fact-checking news. It also produces research on misinformation, like the QAnon conspiracy theory. View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2021 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."

DevOps and agile methodologies certainly have shifted the priorities and practices of technology teams. Now, as organizations prepare for the post-Covid boom in activity ahead, these efforts will need to be at the forefront of cultural change and engaging customers. DevOps and agile need to break out of the IT department and become everyone's best practices. The role of IT professionals and managers in the year ahead will be to apply their learnings and educate and demonstrate the power of these philosophies to the rest of the enterprise.

Inspired by the world of just-in-time manufacturing and widely practised in 'greenfield' IT organisations such as web-scale businesses and startups, DevOps is now making inroads into the 'brownfield' enterprise market.

There's no question that DevOps and agile are everywhere now, at least within the IT world. As discussed on our previous post, 74% of organizations now report having an active DevOps program, up from 47% five years ago -- and the Covid crisis of 2020 only put an exclamation point on these efforts. Agile is more widespread, with the most recent data showing 95% of organizations practice agile development methods. However, only 33% report that more than half of their teams are actually practicing agile principles. Also: What is low-code and no-code? A guide to development platformsAgile practices may have been what pulled many enterprises through the Covid crisis, as the great corporate dispersal took place. ""Just look at how quickly many could adapt to the new situation when the pandemic struck,"" says says Johan Karlsson, senior consultant at Perforce. ""It was mind-blowing how even very large enterprises could switch to being fully distributed in a very short time. That is one example where already implemented agile improvements became extra valuable.""As we move toward into the next era, a lot of what goes forward with both DevOps and agile is about having the proper mindset. DevOps, for one, ""is a movement that refuses to be defined,"" says Mike Loukides, vice president of emerging tech content at O'Reilly Media. ""Many organizations are leveraging DevOps as a specific set of tools and pipelines for deploying applications. However, it's still spotty in terms of organizations leveraging DevOps for cultural changes around the interaction between operations groups, developers and management. When it comes to providing direct collaboration between developers and operations, this is observed more in the breach."" Is DevOps delivering on its promises, then? At some companies focusing on getting DevOps right, the results have been impressive. ""We have adopted multiple practices and, most importantly, the cultural mindset change which is at the core of DevOps,"" says John Donoghue, director of development at Smart Communications. ""This closer alignment of development and operations teams has resulted in less rework of features to meet operational needs, more frequent releases, better operational stability and improved quality.""  The maturity of DevOps initiatives is a major factor. ""On one end you have entire industries such as the game development industry that has been revolutionized by live operations, and DevOps has become a natural part of that quickly,"" says Karlsson. ""On the other side you have industries that are coming from more siloed approach that are just touching the surface of the possibilities -- but they have started the journey.""  Also: DevOps engineers are in high demand, these courses will help you become one""You can't just take an agile certificate, read a book, watch a video and implement practices suggested there,"" says Karlsson. ""Management teams looking to implement large-scale agile frameworks run into this risk. The most real pain is typically not on team level -- it is on system level across teams.""  It's the soft skills that can make or break DevOps and agile engagements. ""You can have all the DevOps tooling, pipelines, and dashboards setup, but if teams start to revert to old ways of ad hoc changes, deployments without testing, the process and the methodology falls apart,"" cautions Joe Clarke, distinguished customer experience engineer at Cisco: ""Likewise, with agile, you need a culture of transparency with alignment to strategy where all work is recorded so that you have end-to-end traceability and accountability to the strategy.""At Donoghue's company, the biggest challenge with DevOps has been extending the benefits to the customer. This means ""balancing support for customers with differing appetite for changes that impact them,"" he relates. ""Continuous delivery is a prime example: some customers welcome knowing they always have the latest updates, whereas others are concerned about the frequency of change. Ensuring all customers have high confidence in the quality of changes is a key part of continuing to move forward.""  The customer also needs to be front and center of agile efforts as well. ""Demoing to the customer"" should be at the core of any agile initiative, says Loukides. ""Agile is really all about getting to the right end point by making many small, mid-course corrections to your direction. So, if there's one thing that's missing, in most instances, it's that commitment to the customer.""

Most every organization has been thrust into the future of work. What will determine failure or success in this brave new world?

Of course, customers come into the picture at all levels, and aren't necessarily consumers with mobile phones. ""We have found a DevOps approach is required to continue improving and extending the benefits into operations,"" says Donoghue.  ""As a supplier to very large enterprises, we haven't found it practical for development teams to directly collaborate with end-users. We prefer to work with a customer representative whose vital role is to find appropriate collaborators within each customer, gather and consolidate their feedback, then balance their varying needs and priorities."" Donoghue advises starting DevOps with ""automated build, test and deployment. A micro-services approach helps encapsulate the scope of changes, allowing targeted releases of reduced size. These become faster to roll out with clear understanding and more easily controlled risks. Containerization improves this further by minimizing the difference between development, test and production environments, further increasing control and reducing risk.""    Communication cuts through the rough patches that may be encountered with DevOps or agile efforts that go astray. ""This is especially true with the reduced face time and direct collaboration these days,"" Clarke says. ""Don't let problems fester and derail the efforts."" Good collaboration and communication tools help, he adds -- ""it's so much easier to get things done where these tools fit your workflow versus having to do unnatural things to sync up with people."" At the same time, he advises keeping this tooling simple. ""The more boxes in your architecture, the more fragile and fragmented things become, which leads to frustration and softness of process."" Research the right tools ""for source control, CI/CD builds, testing, and deployments, and issue tracking, so that you have single tools for specific tasks  -- and not a new tool every day or competing tools to do the same thing,"" Clarke advises.It's important to note that simply announcing that you are creating a DevOps practice doesn't accomplish anything. ""Organizations creating DevOps teams or hiring DevOps engineers has almost completely missed the point,"" says Loukides. ""DevOps is about collaboration between existing teams, rather than creating new teams and new specialties. For the most part, the kind of collaboration between dev groups and ops groups that DevOps envisions has not taken place.""  The advent of AI and machine learning may be helping to shift this equation, Loukides continues. ""There has been some progress on this, as people are now talking about MLOps -- and DevOps is well-positioned to solve these problems. But MLOps at this point is still very immature. There's a lot of tooling needed that we're only starting to have, such as version control for data, version control for models, testing for applications that aren't deterministic and deployment pipelines for models that can take days to train."" Simultaneously, ""there's not enough recognition that an AI application is radically different from the typical web/database application that DevOps grew up with,"" Loukides adds.Also: What is Agile software development? Everything you need to know about delivering better code, fasterProgress is also slow on the agile front. ""If you speak to people in software development, you'll find that many of them are doing agile processes that are just renamed versions of their old processes,"" says Loukides. ""Agile has a lot of value, but 20 years after the Agile Manifesto, we're still not delivering on the promises.""   While the manifesto emphasizes deep contact with the customer, ""some engineering groups still avoid contact with the customer,"" he says. ""This means the single most important thing in the Agile Manifesto is the thing that most development teams are least likely to do.""An enterprise view is needed. ""One team may be really getting it achieving local success with the right toolsets and mindset,"" says Karlsson. ""However, without the right support from management and other teams to achieve global optimizations and cross-pollination of the successes, they may just be moving underlying issues from one area to another."" As with agile, he adds, ""if an organization would tell me that they have reached the final station, they have reached the agile nirvana, then they missed the whole piece around continuous improvement and are not to be believed.""

327,Ongoing Fallout 4 DLC lawsuit could impact Microsoft's takeover of Bethesda,Business,https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/377927/Ongoing_Fallout_4_DLC_lawsuit_could_impact_Microsofts_takeover_of_Bethesda.php,"Gamasutra is part of the Informa Tech Division of Informa PLCThis site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them. Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.Bethesda has been dealing with a lawsuit over its handling of Fallout 4's downloadable content that could impact Microsoft's takeover of the company.The lawsuit was filed in July 2019, and alleges that Bethesda misled consumers by promising the $30 season pass for Fallout 4 would include every single piece of DLC for the title.As reported by GamesBeat, the suit quotes Bethesda's pledge that its Season Pass will ""get you all of the Fallout 4 DLC we ever do for just $30."" The company also claimed the value of its Season Pass content ""will be worth at least $40.""The attorneys involved in the lawsuit claim millions of players purchased the Season Pass based on that promise. They also say those players were eventually left short-changed when Bethesda introduced its Creation Club in 2017.The Creation Club was billed by the studio as ""a collection of all-new content for both Fallout 4 and Skyrim,"" and includes fan-made mods along with content created by Bethesda itself. That content, however, wasn't made available to Season Pass owners -- and that's where it's alleged Bethesda crossed the line. Speaking to GamesBeat, Fillippo Marchino, an attorney at the class-action law firm 'The X-Law Group' handling the lawsuit, claimed that Creation Club content actually constitutes a second wave of DLC and should have been offered to Season Pass holders at no extra cost. ""Simply put, Bethesda sold a Season Pass with the understanding that it was going to give the holders of the Season Pass any and all DLC content there was going to be created for the game Fallout 4 on a go-forward basis,"" said Marchino.""They released a limited amount of DLC. Then they released a second wave of DLC, but decided to call it the Creation Club content and artificially removed it from the definition of DLC. Meaning that they promised people at the onset, we will give you everything we made. And then they reneged on that promise, and they did so to their benefit or the detriment of the plaintiffs. So that’s where they did something wrong. They lied. They took money from gamers, and then they made more money.""Bethesda counsel Margaret Esquenet has denied most of the legal claims against the company, pushing back against the notion that Creation Club content is DLC. In terms of how the suit could impact Microsoft's impending $7.5 billion takeover of Bethesda, Marchino now wants a judge to halt the sale to prevent Bethesda from moving its assets to a new legal entity -- effectively shielding it from any legal liability related to the lawsuit. ""What we’re going to try and do is go in and ask a judge to stop the sale between Microsoft and Bethesda to preserve the assets,"" said Marchino. ""It’s known as a motion for preliminary injunction.""At the time of writing, a trial could reportedly be scheduled for 2022 unless both parties can agree a settlement that would allow the plaintiffs involved to recover their ""economic losses and damages suffered"" -- such as the $281 worth of Creation Club content it's claimed should have been included in the Season Pass.Be sure to check out the full story on GamesBeat for more information and legal insights.Copyright © 2021 Informa PLC

328,"What AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile are buying up: The 5G battle between US carriers just got very interesting",Networking/Telecom,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/02/27/att-verizon-tmobile-which-5-g-phone-to-get/6825233002/,"Though you probably never thought you needed to understand the intricacies of how cellular networks operated by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon work, some big news that affects those operations will have real-world effects on the services that they offer and that we rely on. Late Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission announced the final results of what’s commonly called the “C-Band Auction.” The end result is a recasting of how the Big 3 carriers are going to compete and what they’re going to be able to offer in the 5G era.The C-Band auction involved purchasing the right to use certain radio frequencies for delivering 5G services – think of it as adding lanes to each of their wireless data superhighways. (To dive a bit deeper into the technologies behind 5G, check out one of my columns on the topic “5G could change everything. Here’s what you need to know before you buy into the tech.”)What makes this news particularly interesting is that these aren’t just any frequencies but a large chunk of critically important ones referred to as mid-band (because at 3.7 to 3.98 GHz, they fall into the middle of available frequencies used for wireless networks).In every country except the USA, 5G networks have been built around this mid-band spectrum because it offers the right combination of coverage area and width of data lanes over which our TV shows can be streamed, Instagram posts uploaded, worldwide web browsed, etc.Other industries (notably the old-school, large C-Band satellite dishes – hence the name) had been assigned to use these frequencies in the USA, so they’re just now becoming available here.Ever have 'Zoom fatigue?' These are causes and how to fix them, researchers sayStreaming options:Paramount+ to launch next week starting at $4.99 with adsHaving had to wait a long time, the major U.S. carriers were certainly hungry for access to these mid-band frequencies – so much so that the auction raised a record-setting $81 billion, of which $78 billion was spent by Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.Verizon spent a whopping $45 billion for access to about 160 MHz of the 280 MHz of radio frequency spectrum made available, nearly double AT&T’s $23 billion for 80 MHz and four times more than T-Mobile’s roughly $10 billion, which netted it about 30 MHz. (The remaining $3 billion and roughly 10 MHz was split among a number of smaller carriers and other companies.)By themselves, these numbers are very interesting and say a lot about how important the carriers viewed these frequencies for their 5G service plans. At first glance, they seem to make the argument that Verizon has positioned itself more strongly than its competitors. The real story is more complex than that, and the implications behind these numbers are even more telling than they first appear.First and foremost, these investments make it clear that the future of 5G wireless in the USA is going to be all about mid-band, just as it is in other countries.What that also means is, despite all the hoopla that carriers have tried to make about the two other main types of 5G service, they will soon be reduced to more secondary “support” functions for 5G.The Clubhouse app:What is the allure of the invite-only social media network?We're talking about, most notably, the nationwide but slow low-band 5G service that T-Mobile (with 600 MHz) and AT&T (at 850 MHz) have touted, as well as the superfast but nearly impossible to find short-range, high-band millimeter wave (mmWave)-based service that Verizon has been particularly vocal about – its UWB, or Ultra Wideband service.Low-band service will primarily be used for rural coverage, and high-band mmWave will primarily be used for special situations, such as in large venues, airports and outdoors in some very dense, urban areas. To be clear, both of these 5G flavors will still be important, but they’ll be only part of the 5G story instead of the primary focus, as they have been.From a competitive perspective, T-Mobile already has a huge swath of mid-band spectrum it acquired when it purchased Sprint. According to some reports, it’s a bit more than what Verizon and AT&T combined purchased via this auction. That’s why T-Mobile spent so much less and why it has a significant lead in available mid-band frequencies to use for 5G.The other benefit for T-Mobile is that it is the only carrier that uses mid-band to deliver 5G, and that results in speeds about 10 times higher than standard 4G speeds in cities where the company enabled its mid-band 5G service.Things will start to get more interesting around the end of this year or early 2022, because the first 100 MHz of the C-Band frequencies will become available, and only Verizon (which got 60 MHz) and AT&T (which got 40 MHz) have access to the first batch. (All the remaining C Band frequencies, including the ones T-Mobile licensed, won’t be available until 2023).As a result, by this time next year, we should have the first set of truly competitive, mid-band based 5G offerings with significant speed enhancements over what we have available now.One of the challenges for the carriers is that although they spent huge sums of money to get access to those game-changing frequencies, they must spend a lot more to purchase equipment to upgrade their networks to use those frequencies.That could lead to higher prices for these new 5G services – although the strong competition may temper that.Finally, the other big takeaway from all this news is that the availability of more and faster data lanes that come as a result of using these new frequencies will give carriers the opportunity to deliver some of the first 5G-only services that we’ve all been promised.New types of offerings – including high-speed wireless 5G broadband service to compete with cable providers – can be made available to wider audiences with the help of these frequencies. There could be other interesting new capabilities we haven’t even thought of that become possible with this new mid-band spectrum.T-Mobile has about a year head start over its competitors to get going on faster speeds and additional 5G services using its mid-band frequencies. The results of the auction to license new frequencies is going to create some interesting opportunities for all the major U.S. carriers, and we will all benefit from that.USA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

329,Dark Web Hackers Leaked Canadian Military Spy Plane's Design Docs,Security,https://www.techtimes.com/articles/257481/20210226/darkweb-hackers-leak-canadian-military-spy-planes-sensitive-data-design.htm,"Security experts claimed hackers leaked a Canadian spy plane's sensitive info on the Darkweb! As of the moment, reports stated that the accused ransomware gang has allegedly posted the details of a Swedish airborne early warning and control aircraft. According to Popular Mechanics' latest report, the affected plane is specifically the Globaleye, which is an aircraft that combines the Bombadier 6000 long-range global business jet with Saab's Erieye airborne radar sensor. The hacked spy plane is designed to act as the ears and eyes of the Canadian Air Force. It is specifically created to detect enemy missiles. drones, and aircraft at long ranges. It can also inform the Canadian Air Force so that it can dispatch its own fighter jets to check or counter the detected attack. Globaleye is comparable to the United States Air Force's E-2 Sentry airborne control and warning aircraft. This means that Canada also heavily relies on this plane. Since the aircraft is important to the Canadian Air Force, this means that the hack is currently a serious one. Also Read: Experts Say Hackers Now Use Cloud Apps to Deploy Malware! 61% Delivered Via SharePoint and Other ApplicationsExperts said that they a zero-day exploit in the Accellion FTA web server software, which is used by companies to host and share large files that can't be sent via email to customers and employees. After that, the cybercriminals allegedly posted the Globaleye info to the Dark website called ""CLOP^_-LEAKS."" This site is where the Clop ransomware gang publishes the data they acquired from different companies. They tend to leak their info if the victims were not able to pay the required ransom.  ZDNet previously reported that Globaleye's leaked data came from its developer, Bombardier. Security researchers confirmed that the leaked info contains the company's design documents for different planes. However, they said that the hackers were not able to acquire Bombardier's personal data. Although this is the case, the company said that it is currently worried that the hackers are now offering its private intellectual property on the Dark web for free.

330,Fisker Inc. has ‘completely dropped’ solid-state batteries,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac,"Filed under:Henrik Fisker talks to The Verge about the future of his newly public EV startupHenrik Fisker has abandoned his electric vehicle startup’s effort to create a solid-state battery, the Fisker Inc. founder told The Verge in a recent interview. “It’s the kind of technology where, when you feel like you’re 90 percent there, you’re almost there, until you realize the last 10 percent is much more difficult than the first 90,” he said. “So we have completely dropped solid-state batteries at this point in time because we just don’t see it materializing.”Fisker spoke with The Verge in late January, though a lot has happened since then — most notably, the startup announced a partnership with iPhone-maker Foxconn. The two companies plan to make an electric vehicle that Fisker says will cost much less than the $37,500 base price tag of its first EV, the Ocean SUV. Fisker told The Wall Street Journal that the vehicle may even be built at Foxconn’s troublesome Wisconsin facility. Fisker’s decision to axe the solid-state program comes after his startup spent its first few years working to develop the technology. In 2018, he said the company had solved some of the problems related to making solid-state batteries, and that it was just a few months away from a final design. By early 2019, though, the startup postponed a planned sports car that was based on the solid-state technology and pivoted to the Ocean, which uses a more common lithium-ion battery. Around that time, Fisker Inc. settled a trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed battery startup QuantumScape in 2020, as The Verge first reported this week. QuantumScape discovered one of its employees brought thousands of documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019, though the EV startup argued that it never used the information and swiftly fired the researcher. Fisker Inc. ultimately paid $750,000 to settle the case. The man who ran the project is also no longer with the company and is suing Fisker Inc. over his departure.Solid-state batteries haven’t been much of a focus during Fisker’s many media appearances in the time since he unveiled the Ocean. But he’s never been more clear. “I think personally, they’re at least seven years out, if not more, in terms of any sort of high-volume format,” he said.Fisker Inc.’s trouble with solid-state batteries hasn’t stopped its momentum. It was one of the first EV startups to ride the wave of special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) mergers into becoming publicly traded — and it raised around $1 billion in cash in the process. It struck a deal with leading automotive supplier Magna to build the Ocean. And while a deal to use Volkswagen’s electric vehicle platform has fallen through, Fisker Inc. shared this week that it’s still in talks with the German automaker on a parts supply agreement.A SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company — basically, a pile of cash reserved for a merger that went through the initial public offering (IPO) process. The entire point of the SPAC is to find a private company to merge with. When that happens, the target company essentially goes public without some of the hassles of the traditional IPO process. There has been a lot more SPAC action than usual lately; The Wall Street Journal even declared 2020 a record year for SPACs. Companies such as Virgin Atlantic, Opendoor, Lordstown Motors, and Fisker have all gone through the process. For a more detailed explanation of how SPACS differ from IPOs, see our SPAC explainer.Deals like those are crucial for Fisker Inc.’s survival, which is trying to make it as a truly asset-light automaker. The startup plans to outsource nearly everything with its cars and will instead focus on design and customer relations. In the interview, Fisker spoke about his reasoning behind that business model, as well as why merging with a SPAC was an easy decision, before explaining why he walked away from solid-state batteries.This interview has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.What was it that drew you to wanting to go through one of these mergers, and what did you like about it as a tool to bring Fisker to the public markets Basically, I’m pretty much one of the few people [taking an EV startup public via SPAC], maybe the only one, who’s started a car company before. And that was, of course, in the early days. But one of the big hindrances in the path toward your first production vehicle and getting revenue is financing. And you know if you remember both Fisker [Automotive, Fisker’s first startup] and Tesla back in the day had many private financing rounds, and there was always delays. So we decided really to wait for the right moment where we could get enough money in one go to finance our entire program all the way to production. So when the SPAC opportunity emerged and we saw we could raise over a billion dollars in cash, which was enough to get our vehicle on the road, this was just the perfect opportunity because now I don’t have to worry about going out and raising money every three months, and how the markets will look, if there’s going to be delays.So we are on time, on budget on our vehicle, and that’s because we have already raised all the money.Was there ever sort of commiseration or conversations among the people in the industry that you’re in, particularly executives at EV startups trying to make a name for themselves, about the difficulty, or the process in general, of trying to raise money? And how that changed so quickly with this SPAC stuff? I would imagine that it must have felt like a very strange moment but a very great opportunity at the same time.Yeah, talking to just a few people in the industry, I think everybody’s aware that what’s unique about the automotive industry is that you need several hundred million dollars every time you move a certain milestone. It’s just very, very difficult to convince private investors to go through all of these milestones, all hundreds of millions. And I think in the meantime, what SPACs have really done is replaced Silicon Valley as a funding tool for capital-intensive industries like automotive, EVs. So I think when this opportunity happened, it was just a clear decision right from the go. We didn’t have any doubt. We were obviously one of the early ones that came out, but now there’s been a ton of other SPACs and EV companies [merging]. Obviously, it doesn’t change the fact that you still have to develop and deliver a vehicle, and you still have to be as tight with the money as you can because in the automotive industry, you can burn through hundreds of millions very fast. Those fundamentals are changing, but if you start out with a billion dollars, it’s a lot better than starting out with maybe $50 or $100 million in private funding because that doesn’t get you very far.I’d imagine one way you try to prevent burning through that money really fast is by architecting this asset-light business model that you have. And one thing I’m really curious about, because I know I’ve spoken to you a little bit about it before, is: what was the reception as you started trying to find the right SPAC to merge with, and then also working with additional follow-on investors? What were their reactions to that business model? Well, I think that was really what attracted a lot of the investors. Specifically, I think we have maybe slightly more sophisticated investors than some other SPACs. You know if you TK613 outside the car industry, it’s very easy to say “Why don’t you just do that?” I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.What our business plan is really based on is the philosophy that the automotive industry has not fundamentally changed its way of doing business for the last 100 years. And we took this opportunity to say, “Okay, it’s not just about making an electric car.” You want to look at two other fundamentals. One is, what if we were to create an automotive company today from scratch and think about what’s the right business model rather than just following the old one. That was one. And the second part was how would we truly interact with the customer, and what is the customer’s expectation, and what does the future customer look like? How would we create the real commercial side of it as the vehicle gets delivered to the customer even before? So that became that whole digital model, which started before COVID and has now accelerated during COVID.And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.So therefore, we’ve decided to follow this way of looking for partners for platform sharing, and we’re not only looking for one partner; we’re talking to many different groups because we’re looking at making different vehicles. So we are not necessarily just going to have one partner. And of course, we announced our first partner, which is the world’s third-largest supplier, which is Magna. We’re co-developing a platform with them that is being used also by another OEM, so we immediately have the volume. And we also decided to have Magna manufacture our vehicle because we didn’t feel like taking a risk and going through what other people are calling “manufacturing hell,” as you know. And I think it’s very, maybe a little bit ignorant if you think you can build a factory in the desert, hire people, develop the car, and build a brand-new vehicle, and think you’re going to build it as good as Volkswagen or Toyota.So we did that deal with Magna, which has already built Toyotas and BMWs, so we know we’re going to get a high-quality car right out of the gate, so we took that risk out. And I think our investors really appreciate that because they’ve seen other EV companies fail when they got to that point, or they’re seeing them spend much more money than they thought, so I think that fundamental de-risking really attracted our investors.And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.What are the trade-offs of this business model? Is there something you just have to give up in the name of going after this partnership / asset-light business model that you could have if you tried to do more of it yourself? I don’t think at this point as a startup there is any trade-off. Now obviously, we will look different in five or seven years from now when we have revenue and we have several vehicles on the road. At that point, we can decide to do more of the stuff for ourself. But it’s just like asking a 10-year-old kid “What is the trade-off of living at home versus getting your own apartment?” Well, if you don’t have any money for your own apartment, and you’re not a certain age, you probably can’t even get the apartment, and you’re not going to be able to pay for it. So we’re kind of taking the approach that, as a startup, we are in growth mode and we have no revenue, so therefore we are taking what we believe is the absolute correct approach to get our first vehicle to market. Let’s see what happens after that. We have a whole bunch of plans that we are maybe not ready to discuss right now. But for sure we’re going to evolve as a business. And certain things are going to change and adapt to the conditions of the market, the conditions of where we are as a company.You spoke about the deal with Magna, and it sounds like you are having, or are at least happy with conversations with other potential partners on the platform side of things. What happened with the talks with Volkswagen in the middle of last year? Well, you know we’re constantly in talks with many different partners, and we don’t really want to comment on any of these talks until they materialize. And there’s a common understanding between the partners. So at this point, I don’t want to comment on any potential talks that we have with any partners.One thing I think is interesting about SPAC mergers is that, while they’re a great tool for going public faster, one quirk about them is they’re not regulated in quite the same way as if you were just going public in the traditional way, and one of the consequences of that is that startups have a little bit more freedom in their projections. They can tell what they think is probably a better story to investors than if they were going [public] the more traditional route. I’m curious, do you feel you were overly optimistic in the pitch you were making to investors? Or do you feel like what you presented is a really reasonable case for your business moving forward? My view is that when you present a projection that is two or three years out, you have a group of people who are trying to make the absolutely best projection, and it is at the end of the day a projection. I don’t think there’s any difference, at least for Fisker — I have no idea what other SPACs and other companies are doing, and I know there’s been some exciting stories out there about some other SPACs — but I’d say from Fisker’s point of view, and what we’re doing in our company, there would be no difference whether we would do a normal IPO or a SPAC or a private financing. We are making the same projections, and those are projections, at this point, we stand by. Of course, you never know what’s going to happen in the future. Nobody could have predicted COVID. There were a lot of established car companies that were going to launch a whole bunch of cars last year and were all postponed, and had projected they were going to launch these cars and sell a certain amount of cars. So I don’t think it matters what type of company you are. Everybody can run into certain unforeseen things that you simply cannot plan for. But our projections were not different whether we would have done a normal IPO, private financing, or what we’re doing here as a SPAC. And by the way, now we are public, and we are now set to the same standards of any other public company, no matter how they became public.One of the things I know you were working on in the early days of the company, and especially when you were working on the sports car, was trying to get solid-state batteries into the vehicle. And I know that when you turned your attention to the Ocean that was something that changed as far as a company priority. When you talk about these subsequent vehicles you have planned now and potential different platform partners, is solid-state technology what you are considering? And if so, is it coming from the same technological path that you were already on, or is it something you would have to start anew in those vehicles? So we spent a lot of time, several years, doing research in solid-state batteries. And it’s kind of a technology where when you feel like you’re 90 percent there, you’re almost there, until you realize the last 10 percent is much more difficult than the first 90. But you don’t really know that until you get up to the 90 percent. So as we got toward the end of this — or let’s put it, as we got close to understanding fully this technology, we realized that it was much more difficult than we had predicted and expected in the beginning as we were very excited about some of the early things we were doing. But we eventually came to the conclusion, I think it was probably end of 2019, beginning of ‘20, I forget exactly, that solid-state batteries are still very, very far out, they’re not around the corner. I think personally, they’re at least seven years out, if not more, in terms of any sort of high-volume format. Because you need to ... once you have a breakthrough in that technology, you need probably three years to set up high-volume manufacturing, and then you need another three years to do durability testing. So even if somebody invented it today, it would be at least probably six years out.So we have completely dropped solid-state batteries at this point in time because we just don’t see it materializing. Would we do something in the future? If we do, it would be something completely new, and we obviously have a battery team that’s looking at the current technology that’s here. But the solid-state battery that we worked on, that just doesn't have a future at this point in time in the near future. And I don’t see us continuing with that particular development at all.I know there was a lawsuit that was settled with QuantumScape, and I know settlements usually preclude talking about any of that, but is there anything you can say as to whether whatever dispute you may have had with that company was something that played into this walkaway from solid-state batteries? Or was it really just a technological decision?So as you just mentioned, a settlement precludes you from speaking about it. Sorry.Let’s talk about something that you probably would like to talk about. One of the things I thought was pretty funny in the S-1 you filed with the SEC is that it says outright that you want to really be an engaging presence on Twitter, and you want to make potential customers feel that they’re hearing from you and your voice — as opposed to how like, Mary Barra uses it at GM. And I’m wondering how you see yourself as a person who is running this company who is also engaging with potential customers in this particular way? Because Elon Musk aside, it’s not something we really see all that often.Yeah, I love this personal interaction. I think it’s something unique. And it gives me the opportunity to answer people directly from my heart because I run the company, and they get the real answer. I think there’s sort of a great dual conversation. I can obviously not answer everybody’s question, but for instance, we went a step further, and we have this sort of program for referrals. And what we did was we said the two people with the most leads, I’ll do a half-hour zoom with them. And the interesting thing was the number two guy was a guy from Kentucky, just a really nice person that I would never ever have met. And there was no preselection or anything. He just happened to have the most referrals, which surprised me as well because I would have thought it would’ve been somebody from California because that’s where we have most of the reservations from. But the long story short was he had all of these questions and interesting things to talk about that I would never have heard from anybody unless you just truly sit down and talk with a real customer. And I think that’s an advantage we have that I would never give up. Because normal car companies, they have to go through the dealers and do all kinds of other things where they never really get to talk to the customers.There’s some good with it. Of course, you also get the bad. You get hammered on Twitter, people don’t like you. But hey, that’s life, and I think there’s more of an upside than a downside. And I really like to be able to interact with the people and get their straightforward questions, and I give them straightforward answers.

  One of the things I remember talking to you at length about at CES last year is how you’re approaching this goal of wanting to make the car really sustainable. I’m curious what the progress has been on that. Has anything changed in how you’re approaching those goals of using particular materials for different parts of the car that you view as sustainable? So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.The last thing I want to ask you about is, going back to the business goals and your optimism for where the company is going, one of the things I noticed in the language presenting the business in your financial filings is that Fisker believes the Ocean is going to be a “primary alternative” to the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. What is it that makes you confident you can find the kind of audience to exploit that midrange market that doesn’t have a lot of competition right now? I think you answered part of it yourself by saying there really isn’t any alternative. I mean Tesla made a great car, and what makes us confident that we can be an alternative for when somebody gets out of a gasoline car and into an electric car is, first of all, we have a completely different design. We haven’t designed a “me too” crossover hatchback like the other EV companies have done.That’s number one. And we already have a lot of our customers in our surveys saying they picked our vehicle first because of the design, because we haven't released a lot of technical information. But we also believe we will have some technical advancements, which we obviously don’t want to announce for competitive reasons yet, that will set us apart not only from Tesla but from our other competitors. And then finally, we have some other features in software and hardware like our California Mode, which no other competitor has, where all the windows roll down at the push of one button, which is both kind of fun and a utility feature. And then finally, when you look at our base price, we think we’re really competitive in that base price, so we think we can attract a lot of first-time EV buyers because of that base price as well. And on the high end, I think the sustainability aspect, I believe after COVID, is going to be even more powerful as a brand pillar for us. Because people care about the environment, they care about buying sustainable products, they just haven’t had the choice or they’ve had to buy a product they didn’t like. If you now have the choice to buy a cool vehicle that you actually like and is also super sustainable, I think that’s an added point in our direction.A newsletter about computers"
331,"To go electric, America needs more mines. Can it build them?",Transportation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-insight/to-go-electric-america-needs-more-mines-can-it-build-them-idUSKCN2AT39Z?il=0,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Ernest Scheyder8 Min Read(Reuters) - Last September, in the arid hills of northern Nevada, a cluster of flowers found nowhere else on earth died mysteriously overnight.Conservationists were quick to suspect ioneer Ltd, an Australian firm that wants to mine the lithium that lies beneath the flowers for use in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.One conservation group alleged in a lawsuit that the flowers, known as Tiehm’s buckwheat, were “dug up and destroyed.” The rare plant posed a problem for ioneer because U.S. officials may soon add it to the Endangered Species List, which could scuttle the mining project.Ioneer denies harming the flowers. Their cause of death remains hotly debated - as does the fate of the lithium mine.The clash of environmental priorities underpinning the battle over Tiehm’s buckwheat - conservation vs. green energy - is a microcosm of a much larger political quandary for the new administration of President Joe Biden, who has made big promises to environmentalists as well as labor groups and others who stand to benefit by boosting mining.To please conservationists, Biden has vowed to set aside at least 30% of U.S. federal land and coastal areas for conservation, triple current levels.But that aim could conflict with his promises to hasten the electrification of vehicles and to reduce the country’s dependence on China for rare earths, lithium and other minerals needed for EV batteries. The administration has called the reliance on China a national security threat.The administration will be forced into hard choices that anger one constituency or another.“You can’t have green energy without mining,” Mark Senti, chief executive of Florida-based rare earth magnet company Advanced Magnet Lab Inc. “That’s just the reality.”Rare earth magnets are used to make a range of consumer electronics as well as precision-guided missiles and other weapons.Two sources familiar with White House deliberations on domestic mining told Reuters that Biden plans to allow mines that produce EV metals to be developed under existing environmental standards, rather than face a tightened process that would apply to mining for other materials, such as coal.Biden is open to allowing more mines on federal land, the sources said, but won’t give the industry carte blanche to dig everywhere. That will likely mean approval of mines for rare earths and lithium, though certain copper projects – including a proposed Arizona copper mine from Rio Tinto Plc opposed by Native Americans - are likely to face extra scrutiny, the sources said.The White House declined to comment for this article.Demand for metals used in EV batteries is expected to rise sharply as automakers including Tesla Inc, BMW and General Motors plan major expansions of EV production. California, the biggest U.S. vehicle market, aims to entirely ban fossil fuel-powered engines by 2035.Biden has promised to convert the entire U.S. government fleet - about 640,000 vehicles - to EVs. That plan alone could require a 12-fold increase in U.S. lithium production by 2030, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, as well as increases in output of domestic copper, nickel and cobalt. Federal land is teeming with many of these EV metals, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.“There is no way there’s enough raw materials being produced right now to start replacing millions of gasoline-powered motor vehicles with EVs,” said Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries Inc, which mines the hardening metal tungsten in Portugal and South Korea.Despite that shortage, proposed U.S. mines from Rio Tinto Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Antofagasta Plc, Lithium Americas Corp, Glencore Plc and others are drawing stiff opposition from conservation groups. The projects would supply enough lithium for more than 5 million EV batteries and enough copper for more than 10,000 EVs each year.Mining companies insist that federal lands can still be protected while the U.S. boosts output of minerals needed to accelerate the EV transition.Former U.S. President Donald Trump and the mining industry “pushed the narrative that we need to mine everywhere and undercut environmental safeguards in order to build more batteries,” said Drew McConville of The Wilderness Society, a conservation group. “We have confidence that the Biden administration is going to see through that false narrative.”Earthworks and other environmental groups are now lobbying automakers to only buy metals from mines deemed environmentally friendly by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), a nonprofit group. BMW, Ford Motor Co and Daimler have agreed to abide by IRMA guidelines, and other automakers may follow suit.Biden has not weighed in on two controversial copper mine projects in Minnesota’s environmentally-sensitive Boundary Waters region from PolyMet Mining Corp and Antofagasta Plc’s Twin Metals subsidiary.Tom Vilsack - the secretary of agriculture, the department that oversees the Boundary Waters - has in the past opposed the Twin Metals project, arguing that it threatened wilderness and marshlands.Deb Haaland, the new secretary of interior, the department that controls most federal land, previously voted for a bill that would have banned copper sulfide mining in northern Minnesota. That bill, authored by U.S. Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, will be reintroduced this month, her aides told Reuters.Conservationists nonetheless remain concerned that the appeal of copper for EVs and other renewable energy devices may help the mines ultimately get approved.“If these were coal mines, I’d feel much more comfortable knowing they wouldn’t be approved,” said Pete Marshall of Friends of the Boundary Waters.In Arizona, Biden promised Native Americans - whose votes helped him win the battleground state - that they would have a “seat at the table” if he defeated Trump. Many Native Americans are worried that Rio Tinto’s Resolution proposed copper mine would destroy sacred sites considered home to religious deities.On Monday afternoon, Biden administration officials blocked a land swap Rio needs to build the mine. Trump officials had previously approved that land swap.Other controversial projects include Idaho’s Stibnite proposed mine, from John Paulson-backed Perpetua Resources Corp, which is under fresh scrutiny by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff over fears it would pollute Native American fishing grounds. The mine would produce gold and antimony, used to make alloys for EV batteries.In Nevada, the Department of Wildlife worries that the lithium mines planned by Lithium Americas and others would harm trout, deer and pronghorn habitats. The Lithium Americas mine received federal approval last month, but ranchers have sued the U.S. government to reverse that decision.“Renewable energy and electric cars aren’t green if they destroy an important habitat and drive wildlife extinct,” said Kelly Fuller, of the Western Watersheds Project, which opposes the Lithium Americas project.In Nevada, the death of the Tiehm’s buckwheat flowers at ioneer’s proposed mine site remains a point of contention. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that thirsty squirrels may have gnawed the roots of more than 17,000 flowers for water amid a drought in the state.The Center for Biological Diversity, which opposes the mine, said there was evidence that humans destroyed the flowers. “The targeted nature of the damage, combined with the lack of feces, pawprints, hoofprints, or other evidence of wildlife suggest human involvement,” the group said in a court filing.The Fish and Wildlife Service is now set to rule this summer on whether the flower is an endangered species - a designation that would prevent development on much of the land ioneer is trying to mine.Ioneer has hired scientists to move the flowers to a new site, though it’s unclear if that process will succeed. “We can extract this lithium and also save this flower,” said James Calaway, ioneer’s chairman.Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; editing by Amran Abocar and Brian ThevenotOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

332,Uber wants to work with public transit agencies—but first it needs their trust,Business,https://qz.com/1971558/uber-plans-to-play-a-bigger-role-in-public-transportation/,"These are the core obsessions that drive our newsroom—defining topics of seismic importance to the global economy.These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy!Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend.ReporterAs Uber unwinds its moonshot bets on self-driving cars and flying taxis, it is focusing on a less audacious if no less ambitious goal: enmeshing itself in public transit systems around the globe.In January, Uber published a 52-page report on what it aims to do for public transportation, amid a crisis that has hollowed out transit agency budgets and sent ridership on a steep decline. The company’s pitch to government officials includes several options: Transit agencies can pay Uber to provide rides to people traveling to and from transit stations , or to replace inefficient routes with Uber service. They also can buy routing software to guide both pre-planned and on-demand trips, or allow users to plan, book, pay for, or navigate any trip on public transportation straight from the Uber app.The hope is that sometime in the next three to five years, while standing at a transit platform, you will be able to pull up an Uber app featuring various fare offerings you can purchase, whether that’s for the bus, subway, scooters, bikes, or ride-sharing.Numerous analysts, academics, and bloggers have tried to answer whether Uber is a friend or foe of public transportation. Covid-19 may have clarified the status: In the past year, Ivan Mihov, head of strategy and planning for Uber Transit and a co-author of the company’s report, says that interest on the part of public transit agencies has increased.“We start to see a future where public transportation is much more of a public-private partnership, but agencies are the ones with that in control,” says Mihov. “We’re just improving their tool box.”Uber’s first government partnership launched in 2015, with Uber connecting senior citizens in Gainesville, Florida, to UberX rides. That program still exists.In 2019, Uber Transit became a standalone unit. In the past year, it has inked deals in several places, including Marin County, California, which uses Uber’s software to route four wheelchair-accessible vans. It also makes public transit schedules and discounts available on the Uber app, and offer vouchers for riders taking Uber to travel the last mile to their destination from transit stops.In Chicago and Sydney, riders using public transit can plan their journey—combining UberX with walking directions and bus, subway, or train connections—on the Uber app.Since the Covid-19 crisis started, Uber Transit says it has been working with dozens of other transit agencies and expects to roll out more offerings in the next three to six months.These partnerships not only could transform public transportation but also, ultimately, help Uber achieve its overarching goal of getting more people to swap their cars for ride-sharing.But Uber’s success depends in part on public transit agencies wanting to work with a company that has been known to move fast and loose when it comes to navigating the rules in multiple cities and countries. Uber will need to back up its claims that it wants to complement, and not just compete, with public transit.While Uber’s whole business model was built to bend and flex with ridership demand (see surge pricing), transit agencies, have largely fixed operating costs, and could get the benefit of Uber picking up and dropping off people during off-hours and on routes where typical bus service is too costly. Using a sampling of publicly available US agency route-performance reports that include data on ridership, cost per trip, and average trip length, Uber estimates in its report that 1% to 6% 1 of bus trips could be replaced by Uber pool, allowing agencies to reduce their costs per trip by 15% to 30%.Having Uber fill the gaps in public transit also could make transportation more accessible. Chris Pangilinan, head of global policy for public transportation at Uber and co-author of the company’s January report, says that with Uber, transit agencies can provide rides for people who aren’t within walking distance to traditional public transportation. The report notes that agencies could subsidize Uber rides to help underserved populations get to work or access healthcare services.If it works, this could also be big for Uber. Working with public transit would not only mean increased trips, making its economics more efficient overall; it also would give the company an opportunity to expand its customer base by tapping into the non-typical Uber user.Corey Harper, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon, says, “there’s a negative side to this, too,” depending on how Uber gets used by public transit customers. “Uber impacts congestion and energy use and impacts the efficiency of our transportation system,” he says. “Transit agencies have to think this through—what you don’t really want is people just switching from the transit agency to take Uber.”In 2019, Denver, population 705,576, became the first city in the world to start selling public transit mobile tickets through the Uber app. The Regional Transportation District (RTD), which operates in the Denver-Aurora-Boulder area in Colorado, sells mobile tickets via four different channels (including the Lyft app beginning in December). In 2020, 11% of the agency’s ticket revenue came through mobile channels. Tonya Anderson, a senior product manager of electronic fare operations at RTD, says most of the revenue came from the agency’s app, while about 4% currently comes from the Uber app.Mobile tickets provide convenience for users, but not everyone wants to download another app, she says. Selling tickets on Uber’s app offers another way to reach customers.In the long run, Anderson says the agency’s goal in working with Uber is to replace inefficient routes. But she says the RTD still needs to collect and analyze the data and “have these experiments running for a little bit longer” before it can “more confidently engage with Uber and TNCs [transportation network companies] to augment our services.” The agency also is wary of the potential implications for congestion.There are several other potential sticking points—for example, what to charge customers for replacement rides offered by Uber. (At $3, the current price of a one-way local fare ticket costs a lot less than the average Uber ride. Ideally the new price is fair to customers and would reduce the agency’s operating costs.) Anderson says it’s also likely the RTD will need to negotiate with its union workers before it can implement something with Uber at scale.“I think, just to be transparent and honest, but trying to stay positive, there is a little bit of apprehension when it comes to public transportation agencies working with Uber because of some of not-so-great experiences in the past,” says Anderson. The agency’s initial conversation with Uber “wasn’t very collaborative,” she says. But over the last year, she says the agency has found that the new Uber Transit division, which is specifically focused on public transit, genuinely wants to learn about the agency’s goals and help it achieve them.There’s still a question of where Uber Transit fits within Uber’s overall strategy and its goal of becoming profitable. Uber, which reported a $6.7 billion loss for 2020, declined to disclose how much it has invested in Uber Transit.Uber’s rides business has taken an earnings hit in the pandemic, and the company has sold the divisions that were spearheading its bets on things like air taxis and autonomous vehicles. But Mihov notes that the 220-member Uber Transit team hasn’t lost any headcount throughout the crisis. He says that “it’s still one of the bets within Uber” with “an area of growth and opportunity.”Mihov, who formerly worked at Zoox, a Bay Area autonomous vehicle startup, adds that the deployment of AV technology “is a really long-term thing.” Assuming that self-driving vehicles become standard a decade from now, or whenever, they would be another mode plugged into Uber’s transit offerings, Pangilinan says.Working with transit agencies certainly fits well into the goal of creating an ecosystem where users will have more choice. “We really do think that a better public transportation system is, one, better for cities, but two, it is also good for Uber,” says Pangilinan. “It’s also good for all of us that are not in the business of selling people cars.”But it will be up to transit agencies to make sure whatever deals they strike with private providers don’t end up cannibalizing their ridership. Perhaps that will mean limiting Uber’s involvement to trips taken to or from rail or bus stations, or during disruptions in regular service, Carnegie Mellon’s Harper suggests. The agencies and private transportation companies “will have to work together to figure out a mutually beneficial partnership,” he says.After working with Uber Transit for a little over a year, Anderson says, “[t]here’s still a lot of work that we can still do just for Uber to understand public transportation and for us to understand Uber.”With RTD’s revenue shortfall for 2021 projected to be $140 million, Anderson says transit-agency officials are asking more questions about whether Uber might be a solution.“If the pandemic didn’t happen, if we didn’t have coronavirus and we were just going along our merry way,” she said, “I don’t think we would be having these conversations with Uber.”📬 Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).By providing your email, you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy.Make business betterDiscoverTopicsMore© 2021 Quartz Media, Inc.

334,Twitter targets Covid vaccine misinformation with labels and 'strike' system,Social Media,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/01/twitter-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-labels,"Company expands efforts against coronavirus falsehoods amid fears over spread of anti-vax material onlineFirst published on Mon 1 Mar 2021 20.48 GMTTwitter is expanding its use of warning labels on tweets that contain misleading details about coronavirus vaccines.The move, announced in a blogpost on Monday, is designed to strengthen the social network’s existing Covid-19 guidance, which has led to the removal of more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5m accounts worldwide.In December the platform started providing more labels providing additional context to tweets with disputed information about the pandemic. Now the company is increasing its focus on posts about vaccines specifically, and starting a strike system that “determines when further enforcement action is necessary”.Twitter’s decision comes amid concern about the spread of anti-vaccination material on social media.Labels will initially be enforced by humans only, which will help automated systems pick up on violating content going forward. Users will face no additional action after their first strike.Two strikes will lead to a 12-hour account lock, with a further 12 hours added for a third offense. A seven-day account lock will be imposed after four strikes, followed by a permanent suspension for five or more strikes.The company is starting with English-language content and says it will work to expand to other languages and cultural contexts over time.“We believe the strike system will help to educate the public on our policies and further reduce the spread of potentially harmful and misleading information on Twitter, particularly for repeated moderate and high-severity violations of our rules,” the company said.The change was a “move in the right direction”, said Lisa Fazio, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University who studies the psychology of fake news.“As always, the devil is in the details,” she said. “The success of the policy will depend on how consistently it is applied, how accurately it is applied, and how well the appeals process works.”Facebook, for example, enacted specific regulations on topics including political and vaccine misinformation but was criticized for how it actually acted on that rule, with some accusing the company of refusing to take action on conservative misinformation to avoid being seen as politically biased.Under the new policy, users cannot report other users specifically for Covid misinformation, despite that type of content being banned on the platform. Instead, users who think a particular tweet breaks the company’s rules on Covid must report it for another offense – such as “threatening harm” – and use the text box to add that it is banned misinformation.The new Twitter policies come after Facebook banned vaccine misinformation entirely in early February, using a similar strike system that suspends users who post false claims and permanently removes those with multiple violations. Facebook is specifically targeting pages and groups with the new guidelines, which are not specific to Covid-related content and will also target falsehoods including suggesting vaccines cause autism – a baseless claim made by many in the anti-vax community.Twitter, Facebook, and platforms such as Instagram and TikTok began adding links and labels to any information about Covid-19 early in the pandemic. On Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, posting even the term “Covid-19” will get a post accompanied by a warning label and a link to accurate information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The prevalence of misinformation and how it is handled on these platforms underscores the outsized influence the massive private companies have on public health issues, democracy, and decisions around free speech, said Gautam Hans, director of the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt University.“We should have some democratic concerns about how these private companies have so much control to allow speech to happen or not without any kind of real democratic accountability, and the ways in which current First Amendment doctrine stymies much legislation or regulation on this front,” Hans said."
335,'I'm operating': doctor makes Zoom court appearance while in surgery | California,Society,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/28/im-operating-doctor-makes-zoom-court-appearance-while-in-surgery,"California medical board to investigate after plastic surgeon appeared at a virtual trial from an operating theatreFirst published on Sun 28 Feb 2021 02.02 GMTA plastic surgeon is under an ethics investigation in California for appearing at a virtual court hearing while dressed in medical scrubs and operating on a patient.Dr Scott Green had already begun the procedure when he was called by the clerk of the Sacramento superior court to answer a traffic charge.“Are you available for trial?” the clerk asked, as the hearing streamed live on YouTube. “It kind of looks like you’re in an operating room right now?”“I am sir. Yes, I’m in an operating room right now. Yes, I’m available for trial. Go right ahead,” Green replied, with beeps from medical equipment and suction noises audible. In the background another individual in surgical scrubs is seen adjusting lamps over the operating table.The hearing, which was live-streaming according to the court’s Covid-19 protocols, was promptly adjourned when the presiding commissioner, Gary Link, realised what was going on.“So unless I’m mistaken, I’m seeing a defendant that’s in the middle of an operating room appearing to be actively engaged in providing services to a patient. Is that correct, Mr Green? Or should I say Dr Green?” Link asked, according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper.Green replied that he was, but that a second surgeon was present and able to take over the procedure while he addressed the court.“I don’t think that’s appropriate,” Link said. “I’m going to come up with a different date when you’re not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient.”Despite Green’s apology, the medical board of California has said it will investigate. “The board expects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients,” it said in a statement.Green joins a growing list of professionals to have fallen foul of online court procedures imposed by the pandemic. Rod Ponton, a Texas lawyer, was widely ridiculed earlier in February when he was unable to remove a cat’s head filter superimposed on his face during a hearing on Zoom.“I’m here live. I’m not a cat,” Ponton explained to Judge Roy Ferguson as an assistant scrambled to remove the filter.“I can see that,” Ferguson responded."
336,Internet of Cars: A driver-side primer on IoT implementation,Software,https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/internet-of-cars-a-driver-side-primer-on-iot-implementation/,"Billions of devices are currently connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), and researchers are predicting tremendous growth in the coming decade.One of the most exciting, challenging and potentially lucrative areas of the IoT is the automotive sector. The car is a major component of most people’s daily lives, and a “smart” car could do a lot to save people time and money.At the same time, the “Internet of Cars” carries with it dystopian visions of increased ad noise and security threats. It’s worth considering for a moment what these scenarios look like — good and bad — and how consumers can educate themselves to ensure that the cars of the future are driving in the right direction. Imagine if your car was able to call your mechanic when the engine was showing signs of trouble. Imagine if the mechanic could read a data report from your engine and order the required parts ahead of time. Imagine if the data on those parts could be aggregated to warn of the need for any mass recalls? What if your car could communicate with other cars around it in a traffic jam, and the cars could all work together to space out and ease congestion?What if your car could pay automatically at parking garages and drive-throughs? Anyone that owns a car is familiar with all these pain points, and the prospect of a new system that erases these spots of friction would be a welcome development.But how can we ensure that all of this new data from our smart cars will be handled in a secure and private way? It seems likely, as car manufacturers work quickly to bring their products online, that tech giants will be the first partners to help implement the Internet of Cars. This might be cause for concern amongst consumers who are growing tired of their data being sold or hacked. The big tech companies aren’t inherently evil, but their basic business models are structured in such a way that consumer privacy and security are not the main priorities.It’s not hard to imagine how the Internet of Cars could move in a much darker direction: Advertisements with real-time location data updating constantly on your windshield, personal data such as your driving habits stored on central servers, and a myriad of new vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. How do we bring cars online so that friction in our lives is smoothed down without introducing a unique set of new problems?Of course Big Tech companies will be eager to offer connectivity for drivers, but it’s most likely going to come at the price of giving personal data over to Big Tech servers. This brings with it, as always, two major problems. The first is that centralized data represents a honeypot for hackers. No matter the strength of the security system, hackers realize that once they break through, they have access to the whole pot. The second problem is that the value of all that data is simply too lucrative for the owner to ignore. The data will always be sold, regardless of all the lip service promising to make it anonymous.The IoT represents a new layer of IT integration in our lives; it will be at least as much of a game-changer as the internet was originally. Even with the advancement of the mobile internet brought about by smartphones, internet implementations have, until now, basically been carried out through clunky interfaces like screens, keyboards and mouses. The IoT is going to bring a new level of sophistication to how and where we interface online, but this also means a new level of intrusion into our physical reality. In the case of cars, we can be rightly wary that this new development might be problematic, but it doesn’t have to be.Distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents a path forward for the Internet of Cars, because it builds data security and privacy into the foundations of any connected devices. Any model of DLT includes some basic concepts such that data is carried on a decentralized network of computers and servers. It also means that data is stored permanently, and that new entries of any data are subject to a mathematical verification. DLT is a fundamentally different way to handle massive amounts of data. DLTs have proven to be extremely resilient to attacks, and the data on these networks is nearly impossible to collect and sell.There are millions of internet-connected cars already on the road, albeit mostly with crude subscription services for music and weather apps. With further advances, connection will be much more encompassing, with the average connected car having up to 200 sensors installed, each recording a point of data, minute by minute. The numbers quickly become staggering, and in emergency situations, the need for data agility is apparent. Picture driving on a highway in medium traffic.If someone’s tire blows out half a mile ahead, this information could be quickly conveyed to surrounding cars, warning of the potential for emergency braking. Any DLT solution would have to include a very nimble verification process for all these new packets of information to be brought into and carried by the network.Additionally, because of the computational complexity involved, almost all DLTs today charge a fee for each new transaction brought into the network. In fact, the fee is an integral part of the structure of many of these computational models. This is obviously not going to be workable in a system like urban traffic that would be generating billions of “transactions” every day. The truth is that decentralized data networks were never designed to handle these kinds of massive use-case scenarios. Blockchain, for example, is very elegant at censorship-resistance in a network, and this has proven valuable in certain financial use cases.But a DLT that expects a little money every time a car’s air conditioning reports its output is simply unusable for that application. Any DLT that’s going to give us a high level of security and real-time connectivity will also have to be feeless.Security, speed and ease of adaptability through a no-fee structure are the three critical points for any network backing up the Internet of Cars. DLTs are clearly the most secure option, but they must also provide scalability and a feeless structure.The example of being able to pay automatically for a parking garage visit might seem like a trite convenience. In actuality, if we can implement these types of small transactions properly from the beginning, then the hurdles we will jump in solving the complexity and volume of the car traffic data environment will go a long way to creating a safe, consumer-friendly Internet of Things in general.When thinking about a completely connected physical environment, the alternatives to scalable, fee-less DLT are frankly scary."
337,Diamond batteries promise to power space probes for 100 years,Hardware,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Diamond-batteries-promise-to-power-space-probes-for-100-years,"Japan-produced prototype also holds potential to electrify underground minesTOKYO -- Diamond batteries capable of generating electricity for 100 years are being considered for use in space probes and in equipment for underground mining.These batteries use man-made diamonds that generate electricity when placed in a radioactive field. If radioactivity can be controlled and blocked by wrapping these batteries in aluminum or other metal sheets, they can then be put to use.""This is a beautiful crystal. We could extract the potential of diamonds,"" said Satoshi Koizumi, head of the Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Group at the National Institute of Materials Science, holding up a prototype battery, the color of a raw diamond, produced by the group.As the hardest substance in the world, diamond is widely used as industrial tools and can even be transformed into semiconductors. The group has produced a PN junction diode, one of the simplest semiconductor devices, by attaching a thin diamond film to a diamond base to generate electricity.Diamond batteries, or betavoltaic batteries, generate electricity as long as they are in radioactive fields where they can receive beta rays from isotopes such as carbon-14 and nickel-63. These batteries have such long lives because the carbon-14 and nickel-63 decay by half in roughly 5,700 and 100 years respectively.Using silicon carbide, American and other companies have put betavoltaic batteries to practical use. Although diamond has a higher heat exchange rate and silicon carbide, the production of semiconductors from diamond is more difficult.The diamond battery produced by the NIMS is a result of technology and know-how the national research and development institute has accumulated since the 1990s in this field. The heat exchange rate of the used material is about 28%, the world's highest and close to the theoretical limit, though at the element level.The research group at NIMS used electrons, adopted by devices such as electronic microscopes, instead of beta rays for the production of electricity but plans to use nickel-63 from now on.A major problem that developers have yet to solve is how to make the batteries more efficient by boosting power output. For now, these batteries generate only micro-watts of electricity -- a micro-watt is a one-millionth of a watt.Despite that, the battery's potential is plain for all to see. In 2020, the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority and the University of Bristol said they were studying the use of carbon-14 that exists abundantly on the surface of graphite used in nuclear power generation that can be obtained when such plants are dismantled.The U.K. is reportedly considering manufacturing many diamond batteries from the dismantling of these plants. While details about its plans are unavailable, if it succeeds, it will be able to generate electricity for thousands of years.Nuclear batteries include one that uses heat from plutonium. Such batteries are installed in space probes and although they generate a relatively large amount of electricity, plutonium is difficult to treat.In contrast, diamond batteries are highly heat-resistant and have simpler structures.""They can work even at high temperatures and the use of them in space equipment and mineral exploration machines, among others, are conceivable,"" Koizumi of the NIMS said.Sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.Discover the all new Nikkei Asia appDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia appStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia; the most dynamic market in the world.Stay ahead with our exclusives on AsiaGet trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.Get trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.

338,"United, other airlines seek green-fuel tax breaks as some environmentalists push tougher emissions standards",Business,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-united-biofuel-airline-emissions-20210301-rmvwpock6zd55j66vcrhug5nny-story.html," Chief executives of the nation’s largest passenger and cargo airlines met with key Biden administration officials Friday to talk about reducing emissions from airplanes and push incentives for lower-carbon aviation fuels. The White House said the meeting with climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also touched on economic policy and curbing the spread of COVID-19 — travel has been a vector for the virus. But industry officials said emissions dominated the discussion. United Airlines said CEO Scott Kirby asked administration officials to support incentives for sustainable aviation fuel and technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In December, United said it invested an undisclosed amount in a carbon-capture company partly owned by Occidental Petroleum. A United Nations aviation group has concluded that biofuels will remain a tiny source of aviation fuel for several years. Some environmentalists would prefer the Biden administration to impose tougher emissions standards on aircraft rather than create breaks for biofuels. “Biofuels are false solutions that don’t decarbonize air travel,” said Clare Lakewood, a climate-law official with the Center for Biological Diversity. “Real action on aircraft emissions requires phasing out dirty, aging aircraft, maximizing operational efficiencies and funding the rapid development of electrification.” Airplanes account for a small portion of emissions that cause climate change — about 2% to 3% — but their share has been growing rapidly and is expected to roughly triple by midcentury with the global growth in travel. The airline trade group says U.S. carriers have more than doubled the fuel efficiency of their fleets since 1978 and plan further reductions in carbon emissions. But the independent International Council on Clean Transportation says passenger traffic is growing nearly four times faster than fuel efficiency, leading to a 33% increase in emissions between 2013 and 2019. The U.S. accounts for about 23% of aircraft carbon-dioxide emissions, followed by Europe at 19% and China at 13%, the transportation group’s researchers estimated. The White House said McCarthy, Buttigieg and economic adviser Brian Deese were “grateful and optimistic” to hear the airline CEOs talk about current and future efforts to combat climate change. Nicholas Calio, president of the trade group Airlines for America, said the exchange was positive. “Airlines are ready, willing and able partners, and we want to be part of the solution” to climate change, Calio said in a statement. “We stand ready to work in partnership with the Biden administration.” Sign up for Working Lunch, the Tribune’s free business newsletter, emailed Monday-Friday at midday.CONNECTTRIBUNE PUBLISHINGCOMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune "

Last month, it was revealed that Windows 10 contains a weird bug in which the OS throws an error message that the drive is corrupted and that you should reboot the system, when a certain location is accessed via the Command Prompt or a browser. While Microsoft appears to have quietly fixed the issue in the latest Insider Preview build 21322, it still appears to be present in other versions of Windows 10.Bleeping Computer reports that when you run the change directory ""cd"" command on the Command Prompt with a specific location, Windows warns that ""The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable"", recommending that you reboot the machine with chkdsk to fix the drive. This happens even when users with low privileges access the NTFS volume. Microsoft had previously stated that the corruption message is inaccurate and the drive isn't actually corrupted, but another report from OSR claims that in its testing, one instance of Windows 10 failed to reboot even after repeated chkdsk.Microsoft has fixed the issue in its latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build 21322 pushed out a few days ago, and it does not allow users to access the problematic location as can be seen below:Naturally, we tested accessing the location on our virtual machines powered by other, older versions of Windows too. On Windows Vista, the location in question is not accessible either:However, when we tried to access the location via Command Prompt on an old machine with Windows 10 Pro version 1803 - which is an older version of the operating system that is no longer supported. True to reports, there is an error message that the ""file or directory is corrupted and unreadable"", and the system recommends that you close all apps, restart the PC, and repair drive errors to fix the issue:In our case, Windows 10 fortunately did manage to reboot with chkdsk and did not get stuck in a loop. We expect other versions of Windows 10 prior to Insider build 21322 to behave in the same way, barring any serious anomalies:It is important to note that other vendors and companies are trying to block access to the problematic location from their end. Mozilla Firefox 85.0.1 has a check which disables access to locations with the "":$"" symbol, while OSR has released an unofficial patch which disallows access to the path. That said, it is rather strange that Microsoft is not pushing out a hotfix for older versions of Windows 10. We have seen similar issues with other operating systems such as iOS in the past, and while they may not be dangerous in most cases, it is always worth fixing these issues to prevent viral pranks that can be a nuisance for PC owners who are not tech-savvy.

340,Nevada governor proposes giving tech firms power to govern,Politics,https://apnews.com/article/nevada-economy-68ce17bab299e16c1d0549402349aabc,"CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada’s governor on Friday unveiled a proposal that would allow technology companies to establish jurisdictions with powers similar to those of county governments, arguing the state needed to be bold to diversify its economy and pushing back against those who have likened the idea to company towns.“This proposal is an exciting, unprecedented concept that has a potential to position Nevada as a global center of advanced technology and innovation, while helping to create immediate positive economic impact and shape the economy of the future,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said of his Innovation Zones idea. “As we’ve learned in the past, an emergency requires us to throw out the tried-and-true, discard the ‘How We’ve Always Done It’ manual and move on.”Under the proposal, companies developing cutting-edge technologies that have at least 50,000 acres (200 sq. kilometers) of land and promise to invest $1.25 billion could establish “Innovation Zones.” The zones would be governed by a board responsible for overseeing zoning, taxation, law enforcement and other government functions on their land. It would override local county regulations.The governor’s office of economic development would initially appoint three members to govern the zone, including two required to be from the company.While the legislation does not specifically mention the company, the proposal is geared toward Blockchains LLC, a cryptocurrency company that owns 67,000 acres of land (270 sq. kilometers) in rural Storey County. Blockchains LLC hopes to build a smart city 12 miles (19 kilometers) east of Reno that would include underground data storage bunkers, 15,000 homes and a research and development park where entrepreneurs could invent applications of blockchain technology.Blockchain is a digital ledger known mostly for recording cryptocurrency transactions. Local governments have also taken advantage of its secure record-keeping capabilities to document marriage licenses and facilitate overseas voting.The Innovation Zone proposal has sparked concerns about ceding excessive amounts of power to technology companies. But Blockchains CEO Jeffrey Berns insists that the company’s technology has the potential to empower people to control their digital footprint.“What we’re trying to build is a place where you have power instead of companies,” he told The Associated Press earlier in February.An economic impact study commissioned by Blockchains projects the company’s Innovation Zone will create jobs, economic activity and revenue from a tax imposed on transactions made on the blockchain. The study projects Blockchains’ proposal will eventually generate $2.2 billion in direct output annually, about 1.3% of Nevada’s overall economic activity.But forecasting the economic impact of unproven technology is difficult, particularly because many of the potential applications of the company’s ledger technology have yet to be invented.Applied Analysis’ Jeremy Aguero, who authored the study, said the projections were based on more than cryptocurrency transactions and encompassed any action on Blockchains’ database made in Nevada or elsewhere. Blockchains, he said, planned to pilot its cryptocurrency in Nevada on industries like cannabis sales or in the gig economy and then expand its applications to other sectors and locations. All of the transaction taxes would be collected by Nevada.“When we think about it in terms of the revenue estimates that are being yielded, it’s not just related to cryptocurrency. It’s related to any of the transactions that will add a block to the chain,” Aguero said. Blockchain technology is already used to record financial transactions, store medical records and coordinate supply chain logistics. Sisolak said the purpose of innovation zones is to attract developers to Nevada as they devise new ways to use the technology.“The applications of the technology are limitless. We cannot even imagine what their technology could be,” he said.The yet-to-be invented applications are a key reason that Blockchains wants to establish an Innovation Zone. The company and the proposal’s proponents say small jurisdictions are not the ideal governmental bodies to make decisions about new technologies and a massive development that, in Storey County’s case, could increase the population tenfold.“The traditional forms and functions of local government ... are inadequate alone to provide the flexibility and resources conducive to making the State a leader in attracting and retaining new forms and types of businesses,” according to draft legislation.Some locals disagree. Storey County resident Eileen Gay said that the mechanisms in place for development and project approval protect local interests and the environment.“Oversight is what makes for safe, well-considered, well-balanced development,” she told county commissioners at a Feb. 16 meeting. “What is to prevent this 800-pound gorilla of a neighbor from swallowing our small neighborhood up?”Developers may indeed invent new ways to use the digital ledger, but at an August 2020 Storey County Commission meeting, Blockchains lobbyist Matthew Digesti described the company’s proposal as something local governments routinely encounter: a “high-tech business park integrated with a master planned residential community.”Sisolak said he understood that the Innovation Zones was unconventional, but he said the pandemic had proven that Nevada needs to be bold to diversify its tourism-driven economy. He said government and the private sector needed to work together to induce economy recovery.“What we’ve been doing has not worked,” he said. “We cannot wait for economic recovery to come to us. We must accelerate and pursue innovative ways to inject Nevada with new and organic economic growth, and more jobs.”___Sam Metz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

341,"Review | Amazon’s new rotating, follow-you camera is useful — and invasive: The Echo Show 10 tracks your movement to make sure you’re always in the frame on video calls. But it also doubles as a surveillance camera inside your home.",Privacy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/26/amazon-echo-show-10,"I had such great hope for my kitchen-counter paparazzo.The covid-19 Zoom boom has turned us into camera operators. Making sure everyone’s face can be seen in the videoconference is a daily struggle. Along comes Amazon’s new Echo Show 10, a countertop camera and computer that tries to follow you. Spinning in a motorized circle, it does its best to track your body so you’re always in the shot — and in view of its 10.1-inch screen.I spend so much time on video calls, I was tempted to splurge on one of these $250 robot Alexas. But I won’t be buying one after testing a review unit for a few days. While it was useful for in-motion video chats, the Echo Show under-delivered in functions I’d want from a gadget taking valuable counter space.And since it’s both passively listening and watching, the Echo Show needs a more thoughtful approach to privacy. One of its new commands is, literally, “Alexa, stop following me.” And Amazon added an opt-in surveillance function to the device that, at least for me, crosses the line from innovative to invasive.Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a questionAmazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye.Echo devices are mostly known as Alexa smart speakers, but in 2017, Amazon started adding screens with cameras in them to a line called the Echo Show. Now these kinds of countertop computers — also known as smart displays — have become their own aisle at the electronics store. Options include Google’s Nest Hub Max, which uses facial recognition to identify which family member is in front of it, and Facebook’s Portal, which offers its own more limited ability to track faces during calls.A video camera that follows you could definitely be creepy, but it has plenty of uses if it puts people in control. I’ve even heard from a pregnant woman who wanted to use a Facebook Portal to communicate with her doula while giving birth under covid quarantine.The Echo stands out from the pack because its camera and screen physically move. When I call out, “Alexa, Skype video call Rachel,” it swivels to attention. And as we chat, the Echo Show works behind the scenes to follow me, spinning up to nearly 360 degrees. (It can’t spin in complete circles, “Exorcist”-style; once you reach its max in one direction, it will quickly turn the other direction like a head.)The Echo Show’s tracking was useful, when it worked. It kept up with me 80 percent of the time as I walked around my kitchen cooking and chatting, a decent success rate for a new technology.The doorbells have eyes: The privacy battle brewing over home security camerasBut it did sometimes lose track of where I was standing, or cut off the top of my head. And the Echo Show wasn’t fast enough to keep up with a pair of toddlers who helped me test by playing a game of hide-and-seek. I also found it wasn’t smart enough to swivel around 180 degrees to capture someone else who had started talking behind it.Amazon says bright or dark lights can throw off the Show’s person-detection software, and it tries to focus on the center of the action without too many swoops that might look jarring for the person on the other end of the call.There is one annoying limitation to the Echo Show 10’s calling capabilities: At the moment, it works with Alexa’s native video-calling service (requiring the other participant to have an Amazon device or the Alexa app) and with Microsoft’s Skype. Support for Zoom is coming “soon,” but Amazon won’t be specific.How to master the vaccine-appointment website: A guide for everyoneThose camera challenges might be forgivable if the Echo Show were more like a self-driving version of an iPad, the computer that most often inhabits my kitchen counter. But the Echo Show just doesn’t do enough to earn its keep.Even after a few years of developing for Echo Show devices, Alexa is still primarily a voice-operated interface. There aren’t apps like on an iPad. Sure, voice has its advantages when your fingers are covered in cookie dough or you want to quickly turn on smart lights. But other things I can accomplish in three taps with my iPad require grating conversations with Alexa on the Echo Show. (Amazon won’t say how many touch-screen-enabled Alexa skills there are.)And unlike an iPad, the Echo Show also can’t really replace a kitchen TV. Its streaming video options are far short of what you can watch even with Amazon’s own Fire TV devices, especially for live TV such as the local news.My privacy concerns with the Echo Show have to do with Amazon’s devil-may-care approach to putting more cameras into our homes.Amazon has taken a few steps I applaud. The microphone-off switch on the Echo Show physically covers the device’s camera. Amazon also says the data the Echo Show captures to track your body is all processed locally on the device. That means images aren’t ever sent to Amazon, though certain functions that require knowing if someone is near the device, like a video calling feature called Drop In, do pass information about presence to Amazon.Amazon’s new health band is the most invasive tech we’ve ever testedBut there are other new concerns. By default, the camera-powered motion capability is on — and the Echo Show will track you when you interact with it in ways beyond video calls. To stop it in the moment, you say, “Alexa, stop following me.” That phrase alone should have given Amazon some pause it needed to build our trust with this function.If you dig around in the settings, you can find the option to turn off motion tracking or limit it to “select activities.” But there’s no option to track only during video calls.Amazon also added new camera capabilities to the Echo Show that might appeal to some but appall others.An opt-in surveillance function called Live View turns the Echo Show 10 into a rotating security camera. From the Alexa app on a phone, a member of the household can remotely see through the camera, which continues to track whoever is nearby. In a different form, this is like installing a speed-dome security camera in your kitchen.When Live View is activated, the Echo Show makes a chime and pops up a notice on the screen, but this video feed goes only one way. You can tap a button on the screen to stop Live View or close the camera’s lens cover — if you notice it’s happening.Amazon shouldn’t be casually adding surveillance capabilities to household appliances designed primarily for other purposes. How would you feel if you were a teenager knowing your parents could peer in on you at any moment? Or what if you were in an abusive relationship and your partner could do the same?The Echo Show 10 has eyes for you — and should have stuck with only for you.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

343,Cyber warrior’s glimpse into Kim’s Operation Chaos,Security,https://asiatimes.com/2021/02/cyber-warriors-glimpse-into-kims-operation-chaos/,"Asia Times
					Covering geo-political news and current affairs across Asia				One of the most shadowy arms of one of the world’s most shadowy states is finding itself bathed in a harsh and unwelcome global spotlight.Two developments this month are adding to the mounting evidence that while North Korea’s conventional military refrains from provocations, its online operatives are actively, constantly and widely engaged across the borderless web.On February 16, it was alleged that North Korean hackers had hacked pharmaceutical company Pfizer with the aim of stealing information about its Covid-19 vaccine. It is unclear whether the hackers succeeded. Subsequently, European intelligence officials told Reuters that North Korea planned to produce counterfeit vaccines to sell on the global black market.Separately, on February 17, the US Department of Justice indicted two North Koreans and expanded charges against a third for their involvement in a vast multiplicity of cyber crimes, including the 2014 attack on Sony Entertainment and the 2017 global Wannacry DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. According to a 33-page DOJ report, the three attempted to extort or steal $1.3 billion, though their actions went far beyond theft.US Assistant Attorney General John Demers described the three hackers, all whom have a variety of aliases and are believed to be key players in a North Korean unit code-named Lazarus Group as “the world’s leading bank robbers” and “a criminal syndicate with a flag.”North Korea, say experts who spoke to Asia Times, groups its cyber operatives under three arms of the state: The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army; the State Security Bureau; and the Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB. The latter directorate oversees intelligence operatives and special forces units, and is tasked with both espionage and military operations.Some of the key sub-units identified, which are believed to operate under these various agencies have been dubbed Lazarus Group, APT38, Kim Suk Ki (aka Talium), D Track and Hidden Cobra Group. Their aims appear to be fourfold.One is to gather foreign currency for a sanctioned, cash-strapped regime – hence attacks on South Korean and Bangladeshi banks and crypto currency exchanges.Another is to collect useful intelligence – be it on nuclear technologies from an Indian atomic energy plant, defense equipment from Eastern European arms companies, or even Covid-19 vaccine information from Pfizer.Another is to silence or threaten regime opponents or those who insult the dignity of the ruling Kims – hence online attacks on outspoken North Korean defectors and Sony Entertainment (which had produced a satirical comedy featuring national leader Kim Jong Un).And in a regime that clearly uses tests of weapons of mass destruction and parades of military equipment to impress the outside world, yet another aim may be to showcase capabilities that awe the world – such as the infamous global Wannacry attack.But how do Pyongyang’s cyber operations synch with its wider military? And given that cyber operations are virtual rather than real, how dangerous can they truly be? According to experts: “perfectly” and “very.”Pyongyang’s openly shows off its WOMD in parades and tests, but these are weapons of non-use, or last resort. Cyber operations, however, are deniable, and bestride a blurred line between crime and warfare.  Hence they are in constant action.North Korea’s cyber arm “is probably on a par with the North Korean nuclear threat – or more of a threat,” said Chun In-bum, a retired major general who formerly lead South Korea’s Special Warfare Command. “The US and the Chinese and the Russians and the Israelis have cyber capability, but they are tied down by international norms,” Chun said. “North Korea is not in that sphere. They are a loose cannon.”Cyber warfare synchs with North Korea’s military philosophy. State founder Kim Il-sung was an anti-Japanese guerilla leader in Manchuria, and later trained as a scout/sniper in the Red Army in the Russian Far East. The “Great Leader’s” unconventional warfare heritage continues to this day.The North maintains some 200,000 men under the RGB – perhaps the world’s largest special forces. Its special forces “Chogyok” brigades, are usually translated into English as “sniper.” This is an error, Chun insisted: The actual etymology of is “monkey.” That may not come across in English as particularly menacing, but it connotes a principle rather than the animal itself.“A monkey causes havoc,” Chun said. “Think of a monkey in a room – jumping around, running around and hitting people in the head.” For this, “cyber ops given them a really convenient tool,” Chun said – doubly so, given its deniability.One man who has in-depth – indeed, personal – knowledge of North Korea’s dark online arts is Choi Sang-myeon/Simon Choi. He agrees with Chun that the hackers are dangerous – and masters of chaos.The nerdish looking 37-year-old South Korea is a cyber security professional and founder of not-for-profit collective Issue Makers, which has been tracing North Korean hackers since 2008.  He spoke to foreign reporters last week in a non-descript, second-floor cyber security firm in southern Seoul. “When comparing hackers to nuclear missiles, I think hackers are a more major threat,” Choi said. “We know they are developing weapons and missiles, but they have not used them yet. But hacking we see every day – all around us.”Indeed, while Pyongyang’s weapons of mass destruction have never been used, its weapons of mass confusion almost certainly have.In May 2017, the world was shaken by the Wannacry attack, which targeted hundreds of thousands of PCs running the MS Windows operating system, infiltrating them with ransomware, and demanding Bitcoin payment. A range of organizations and companies – the UK’s National Health Service, Spain’s Telefonica and the US’ FedEx – were impacted. The attack was overcome and the chaos subsided after a “kill switch” was discovered within the malware, and MS swiftly uploaded new security patches.Those who paid the ransoms demanded never received fixes – but that was not the point of the attack.“The ransomware was never the main purpose of it – this started with international sanctions [against North Korea] and they wanted to show their potential and create chaos,” said Choi talking of an escalation of the global sanctions regime that picked up in 2016. “If not for the kill switch, the whole world would have been in worse chaos than Covid-19.”Still, Choi remains puzzled about the kill switch that enabled its deactivation.“If I was a hacker, I would make a fortune out of it, it was so powerful!” he said. “I think they put in the kill switch in case things got out of hand and they had to take full responsibility – which is ironic as it had North Korean fingerprints all over it.”In late 2017, following investigations, the UK and US charged North Korean hackers from the Lazarus Group – hackers believed to operate under the RGB – with the attack. Microsoft also alleged that North Korea was behind Wannacry.Choi’s interest in North Korean cyberattacks started during his national service. While for most youths that means military duty, for Choi it meant working in computer security. There, his job was analyzing malicious codes – which is how he first came face-to-face with Pyongyang cyber espionage.“Malignant codes [in South Korea] are usually aimed at online game accounts and stealing from online banking, but this code was a little different,” Choi said. This code was inserted into files related to military terms and military glossaries. The file names included words such as ‘navy’ and ‘weapons’ and even missile names and operational codes.  “This was not a trifling matter,” Choi said.A fascination was sparked. “I was on a mission and wanted to serve the country. I saw myself as a cyber soldier.”After finishing his service, “I wanted to track this movement,” he said. “But I could not do it alone, so I gathered a group of friends to help. I am fully committed.” That group became Issue Makers, which has made it to the finals of the global DEF CON CTF (“Capture the Flag”) hackathon and has spoken at global hacking conferences including Black Hat and CanSecWest. The collective has worked for both the Ministry of National Defense and the National Intelligence Service, and Choi is an advisor to the National Police Agency.Choi’s organization was founded in 2008, but has backtracked many of North Korea’s alleged cyber operations to 2004. It has helped identify the main groups of hackers in North Korea and which of the three state agencies – Army General Staff, State Security and RGB – they operate under. It has also mapped out which groups have attacked which targets.Citing South Korean National Intelligence Service, Choi believes there are some 1,500-1,600 dedicated hackers working for the agencies above, backed by some 5,000 support personnel.Asked to analyze the skillsets of the North’s cyber commandos, he made clear that they are not as sophisticated as the global top tier. Regarding the alleged Israel-US “Stuxnet” cyber attack that crippled Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities in 2010, Choi noted that it took three months for experts “just to analyze the code itself.” North Korea’s codes are “not so sophisticated, but are very practical – they know what they want to know,” Choi said.But a core competency is persistence. Noting that there have been successful hacks into secure South Korean government facilities as well as international airlines and telecommunications firms, he said. “Their MO is to keep on trying until they get what they need.”Another competency is identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.“In the past, they used the skillsets China and the US have, and tweaked those skillsets, but recently they have been finding weaknesses of targets and going through,” he said. “They are one of the top three in the world in identifying vulnerabilities.”What, then, are the clues that suggest North Korean involvement?In 2009, following a denial of service (DOS) attack on the server of the South Korean presidential office and hundreds of thousands of PCs, Choi and his team analyzed the codes and protocols, and traced them into North Korea.As an example of fingerprints, Choi cited the first clue: The code itself, written in Korean. “So, it was 1+1,” he said. “It could have been a hacker who knows Korean, but some words are a little different in North Korean dialect.” He showed Asia Times some recovered text – the word “Russia” in Korean – which is spelled differently, North and South.Choi has gone face to face – virtually – with North Korean hackers in real time. That required the risky step of directly luring them with a “honey pot.”In 2019, Choi posed as a South Korean government representative. He set up a computer loaded with official-looking documents – but with a program designed to monitor and follow the hacker’s every move.Contacted, he began an online chat and asked if the hacker was North Korean. The mark replied in the affirmative. They briefly chatted – “five to ten pings” – on three occasions. On their third discussion, the North Korean suddenly discontinued the conversation and unleashed a virus designed to destroy Choi’s computer.That did not succeed: Choi having seen similar viruses during attacks on South Korean media firms in 2013, had installed appropriate defenses.Choi traced his opposite number back to a PC with a motherboard dubbed “Pureun Haneul.” Choi did not know what that was, but after a short investigation he discovered it was the brand name of a North Korean electronics firm. “I am not 100% sure it was a North Korean hacker,” he admitted. “But all these details add up.”In a world in which even powerful state agencies in the United States require years of  detailed investigation to pinpoint, identify and bring charges to bear against North Korean hackers, Asia Times cannot confirm Choi’s statements.However – purely by coincidence – his veracity became clear during our interview.Choi was showing this writer a directory of targets amassed by a North Korean hacker. Given that the list, which originated in December 2018, includes the names and online details of multiple persons including South Korean politicians and a prominent defector, Asia Times did not photograph and cannot publish it.But one name and email address on the list caught Asia Times’ eye: Daniel Tudor, an acquaintance of this writer.Briton Tudor is currently a Seoul-based entrepreneur in IT, but was formerly a journalist with The Economist and the co-author of a 2015 book, North Korea Confidential: Private Markets, Fashion Trends, Prison Camps, Dissenters and Defectors.That book, which lifted a veil on the lives of ordinary North Koreans, so irked Pyongyang that Tudor and his co-author, James Pearson, were given police protection in South Korea.Subsequently, after the Moon Jae-in administration came to power in 2017, Tudor became an advisor to the Blue House, the presidential office. Given that the list seen by Asia Times also included Blue House email addresses, it seems likely that it was that affiliation, rather than his book, that had make him a target for direct hacking (“spear phishing”) – particularly as Pearson was not on the list.Contacted by Asia Times with the information that he was a target of North Korean hackers, Tudor’s immediate response was, “That explains a few things!” “A couple of years ago, I kept getting emails almost every few days that ‘government-backed attackers are trying to hack into your account,’” Tudor said. “Who could it have been?”  There were multiple attempts to infiltrate his Twitter and Facebook accounts, and even to access his Apple ID, he continued.“In some ways, I am flattered, I did not realize I was that important,” he said. “But I don’t know what they think they could discover – I don’t have that much money to blackmail.”While Tudor may not have had access to millions – and, with a background in IT, was sensible enough not to become a victim – that is not true of other targets.Indeed, North Korea cyber ninjas have not only stolen currencies and crypto currencies, they have broken into defense-related South Korean computers, and far beyond Korean shores, have stolen information on both weapons systems and nuclear technologies.In Part II of this story, to run in Asia Times on Sunday, we explore some of the targets worldwide that have been hit by North Korean hackers, from arms manufacturers to cryptocurrency wallets; whether North Korea’s actions constitute crime or warfare; and an assessment of how vulnerable – or not – North Korea’s own online infrastructure is to counterattack.This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help us improve and customize your experience.

345,Why France’s new 'repairability index’ is a big deal,Hardware,https://grist.org/climate/why-frances-new-repairability-index-is-a-big-deal/,"Our electronic devices take a serious environmental toll, and one of the best ways to mitigate that is to use them for as long as possible before replacing them. But it’s hard to know how long a new gadget will last if you’re unsure how easy it will be to fix. Now, companies are going to have to start coming clean about that — in France, at least.In a world first move last month, France began requiring makers of certain electronic devices, including smartphones and laptops, to tell consumers how repairable their products are. Manufacturers selling these devices in France must give their products a score, or “repairability index,” based on a range of criteria including how easy it is to take the product apart and the availability of spare parts and technical documents. While France won’t be enforcing use of the index with fines until next year, some companies have already begun releasing scores for their products.The repairability index represents part of France’s effort to combat planned obsolescence, the intentional creation of products with a finite lifespan that need to be replaced frequently, and transition to a more circular economy where waste is minimized. But it also has global implications. Repair advocates say that the index will serve as a litmus test for other nations weighing similar regulations, help consumers make better choices, and hopefully incentivize companies to manufacture more repairable devices.

Always free, always freshThe First 100 Other choicesAsk your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy“It’s a big step in the right direction,” said Ugo Vallauri, the co-founder of Restart Project, a London-based repair advocacy organization and member of the European Right to Repair Campaign.In recent years, electronics of all shapes and sizes have become more difficult to fix due to a combination of design choices and software locks that often require proprietary manufacturer tools to get past. The cost and complexity of repair means that many consumers don’t even try to fix old electronics, instead discarding them for new ones that take additional energy and resources to produce. In 2020, the French government estimates that only 40 percent of broken electronic devices in the country were repaired.To boost that percentage higher, France passed an anti-waste bill last year mandating that electronics manufacturers make a repairability index visible on their products. The index, which initially applies to smartphones, laptops, TVs, washing machines, and lawnmowers, is presented as a score out of 10, with a higher number indicating a more repairable device.Ministère de la Transition écologiqueManufacturers grade their products using worksheets that integrate five criteria: availability of technical documents to aid in repair, ease of disassembly, availability of spare parts, price of spare parts, and a wild-card category for repair issues specific to that class of products. All of the information that went into calculating the index must also be made available to consumers at the time of purchase.Eventually, France intends to expand the score to other classes of consumer products. By 2024, the repair index will transition to a “durability index” that not only tells customers how repairable a product is but also describes its overall robustness.While the repairability index became an official requirement on January 1, many manufacturers are slow-walking its implementation, according to Vallauri. “There wasn’t really enough time to enforce it in early 2021,” Vallauri said, explaining that some of the scoring criteria were only agreed on toward the end of last year.But a trickle of scores are starting to emerge. The French spare parts business Spareka is publishing repairability indices as it receives them from manufacturers, and so far, its website includes scores for Asko washing machines, Samsung TVs, OnePlus smartphones, and more.The scoring system has its limitations. Vallauri explained that the indexes were developed through an intensive stakeholder process that involved input from manufacturers as well as consumer advocacy organizations. Ultimately, this led to some compromises. For instance, as Adèle Chasson of the French repair advocacy organization Stop Planned Obsolescence noted in a blog post, laptop and smartphone makers can get a “free point” by providing consumers with information about different types of software updates, such as security updates or system upgrades — information that may not have anything to do with how fixable the device is.Perhaps more concerningly, manufacturers are going to be self-reporting their scores, and it is unclear whether there will be rigorous governmental oversight to ensure all the math is being done correctly.“Certainly we have seen manufacturers abuse this kind of scoring system in the past,” said Kyle Wiens, CEO of the repair site iFixit, which helped advise the French government on the development of the index. (In fact, France’s index took inspiration from the repairability scores iFixit has been assigning products for years.) But Wiens also suspects that competition will help keep greenwashing in check: Apple, for instance, could call out Samsung if its competitor comes out with a dubiously high repairability index for a flagship smartphone.“Any time you have something like this, you’ll see competitors pushing back on each other,” Wiens said.Repair advocates across Europe are watching the rollout of the French index closely in the hopes that it will soon be spread beyond France’s borders. In November, the European Parliament voted in favor of developing laws that mandate E.U.-wide repairability labeling. Vallauri said that the E.U. is still “probably a few years away” from repairability scores appearing at every shop in every member country, but that draft legislation is expected to emerge this year. The fact that France chose to go first with its own score, he said, “shows that it’s possible” and represents “a good learning opportunity for other countries that can now build on what the French lawmakers created.”The repair community is equally interested in seeing how the French scoring system impacts both consumers and manufacturers.In September, the French government published the results of a study that looked at how 140,000 online shoppers responded to a beta version of the repairability index that included all of the final criteria except for price of spare parts. It found that customers tended to avoid purchasing laptops with a repair index compared with laptops lacking one. Project manager Laurianne Vagharchakian, a behavioral sciences researcher with the French government, attributes this to the fact that study’s average repairability index, at 5.4 out of 10, was probably “not very motivating and attractive” to potential buyers. Other research suggests that consumers prefer products with labels indicating a longer lifespan over competing, shorter-lived products, and that in some cases, they may be willing to pay much more for the more durable product.If repair scores start influencing consumer behavior across France as these findings suggest they will, manufacturers are likely to feel pressure to make devices easier to fix. Both Vallauri and Wiens highlighted the importance of the French repair scores being mandatory for potentially forcing a sea change in how products are made.“We think that the moment something becomes a requirement, it’s no longer really a problem for a manufacturer,” said Vallauri. “They just have to deal with it as one of their variables in bringing a product to the market. So the more some manufacturers choose to make products more repairable, it will motivate others, if nothing else for fear of missing out, to improve their practices.”This story has been updated to clarify that the Restart Project is a member of the European Right to Repair Campaign.Will Biden deliver on climate?

                        , Bloomberg(Bloomberg) -- China’s use of coal in its energy mix continued to decline in 2020, but more aggressive measures may be needed to reduce emissions in order to meet Beijing’s climate goals.Coal use accounted for 56.8% of the country’s total energy consumption last year, down 0.9 of a percentage point from 2019, according to figures released Sunday by the National Bureau of Statistics. The modest decline allowed China to meet a government target to reduce the proportion of coal to around 57.5% in 2020. Still, total coal use climbed by 0.6% as energy consumption rose by 2.2% in 2020 from a year earlier.President Xi Jinping pledged China would target carbon neutrality by 2060 in a Sept. 22 speech to the United Nations. While he didn’t lay out details, Xi’s announcement implies the nation’s emissions will have to sharply decline to reach net-zero in less than 30 years after peaking in 2030.One proposal under consideration to accelerate China’s adoption of clean energy is to cut the share of coal in the energy mix to 52% by 2025, Bloomberg reported earlier. Still a gulf remains between China’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals and the desire of its companies to maintain breakneck growth.China may provide more details of its roadmap to carbon neutrality in its five-year policy blueprint set to be unveiled at legislative meetings that start next week. Beijing’s energy policy will need to juggle the competing demands of delivering economic growth, promoting energy security and mitigating the worst effects of global warming.The proportion of clean energy including natural gas, hydropower, nuclear and wind power in total energy use rose by 1.0 percentage points to 24.3% in 2020, according to China’s statistics bureau.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Wrigley Heir latest to tap SPAC frenzy to take U.S. pot firm publicCannabis retailer Verano CEO: We have always made money U.S. cannabis operator Verano Holdings soars in trading debut"

348,Clubhouse Is Recording Your Conversations. That’s Not Even Its Worst Privacy Problem,Privacy,https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/clubhouse-is-recording-your-conversations-thats-not-even-its-worst-privacy-problem.html,"The 2021 Fastest-Growing Private CompaniesEarly Rate Deadline: March 26Clubhouse was sort of perfectly made for the pandemic. People aren't going out, and they're desperately searching for social connections and entertainment. The app provides both in a way, while capitalizing on the draw of celebrity influencers on the platform.It's also built on one of the most effective strategies for generating buzz and excitement--scarcity. To join Clubhouse, you have to have an invite from someone who is already a member. Not only that, whoever invites you has to have your phone number and has to give Clubhouse access to their iPhone contacts. No access, no invites. From a business standpoint, it certainly makes sense that Clubhouse is taking this approach. Building a social graph from scratch is very hard, and requiring users to upload their contacts list is the most effective way to determine connections. There's a problem, however. As always, the problem comes down to figuring out the right balance between protecting user privacy and the use of data to provide the best experience for both the user and the business behind the app. In that sense, it's worth considering that Clubhouse has a few policies that aren't exactly privacy-friendly. Even worse is the fact that you have to do a bit of digging to even understand what those policies actually are. I reached out to Clubhouse multiple times but did not immediately receive a response to my questions about how it uses data.One of the ""features"" of Clubhouse is that it's ephemeral. You can't listen to it later, or even pause the room you're in. You have to show up live to participate in the experience. That's one thing that sets it apart from, say, podcasts, which are recorded and can be listened to at any time. You can't even record conversations on Clubhouse.But Clubhouse can, and does, record what you say. The app's privacy policy says that Clubhouse rooms are recorded: Solely for the purpose of supporting incident investigations, we temporarily record the audio in a room while the room is live. If a user reports a Trust and Safety violation while the room is active, we retain the audio for the purposes of investigating the incident, and then delete it when the investigation is complete. If no incident is reported in a room, we delete the temporary audio recording when the room ends.That means that if someone does report a problem, everything that happened in the room is recorded and saved. And Clubhouse isn't clear about what happens to it then, other than saying it is saved to allow the company to make a determination. It doesn't say who can listen to it, or under what conditions. Even if you haven't created an account, if someone you know has, there's a good chance Clubhouse already has your phone number. That's because the app requires users to upload their entire contacts database to send invitations. You can invite only someone who is in your contacts, and it doesn't include any ability to share only specific contacts. It's all or nothing. In addition, members share not only their contact list, but, if they connect their social media profiles, that information is collected as well. Clubhouse specifically says that when you ""create your account, and/or authenticate with a third-party service like Twitter, we may collect, store, and periodically update information associated with that third-party account, such as your lists of friends or followers.""What if, say, you have no interest in Clubhouse at all? There's still no mechanism to delete any personal information about you, whether that information is collected via a phone number or through other social media networks like Twitter or Instagram. In fact, even if you have an account, you can't delete it without sending an email to a support account. There's no option anywhere in the app to delete your account, and neither are there any instructions on what to do if you want to delete it. You have to send an email to ""support@alphaexplorationco.com"" to request that your account be canceled, and wait for someone to take action.One of the biggest questions surrounding Clubhouse is how it intends to eventually make money. Looking through the privacy policy, it's clear that it will likely involve some form of advertising or sponsorship system. To get ready for that, Clubhouse is making clear that it ""may share Personal Data with our current and future affiliates."" That's fine, but that same section makes clear that Clubhouse ""may share the categories of Personal Data described above without further notice to you."" That means you have no right to know that your personal information that was collected by Clubhouse is now being used outside of Clubhouse. The privacy policy says it uses cookies, pixels, and tracking technologies to monitor what you do within Clubhouse, and across the web even though it isn't currently monetizing the app. This is confirmed by the privacy policy as well as by traffic monitoring, which shows it uses activity tracking and analytics tools to understand what you are doing with the app.The company's privacy policy also explicitly says:We may share Identification Data and Internet Activity Data with social media platforms and other advertising partners that will use that information to serve you targeted advertisements on social media platforms and other third party websites -- under certain regulations such sharing may be considered a ""sale"" of Personal Data.It seems pretty clear that Clubhouse is getting ready to monetize the platform it's building. That's fair--every business should have a plan for making money. If that plan includes monetizing its users' activity and data, I think we can all agree it should be upfront and transparent about that fact. "

We’ve managed to get access to the latest version of the Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows, an unannounced and unreleased app. Once released, the app will let Windows users stream games from their Xbox Series S / X consoles, and from xCloud.Currently, you can’t stream games from the new Xbox consoles to Windows PCs, as this is unsupported in the existing Xbox Console Companion app. This new app will solve that, and also bring xCloud streaming to Windows PCs for the first time. We first got a look at this xCloud app for Windows last year, and it has improved a lot since then. scoop: here's a look at Microsoft's unreleased xCloud app for Windows. This app lets you stream Xbox games from an Xbox Series X / S console, or from xCloud. Full details here: https://t.co/ymyjQDmaeH pic.twitter.com/V3U3PXe7LOThe Xbox remote play feature, for connecting to Xbox consoles, works similarly to how the existing Console Companion does. You can remotely wake an Xbox console, sign in, and play games wherever you are. There is now full touch support, allowing Surface or other touchscreen devices to play Xbox games without a controller. Microsoft also appears to be readying some form of gyro support here, too. There’s an option to enable this, but it doesn’t appear to be fully functional yet. This is an internal beta application, so it’s still unfinished.Microsoft also appears to be readying 1080p streams for xCloud, instead of the 720p that exists today. This would obviously improve the experience on Windows PCs, ahead of higher resolutions once Microsoft has upgraded its xCloud servers to include Xbox Series X hardware.It’s still not clear exactly when this app will be made available more broadly. Microsoft is rumored to be planning a “what’s new for gaming” event for next month, so it’s possible we’ll hear a lot more about the company’s xCloud plans (for the web and iOS, too) very soon.A newsletter about computers"
351,Google Stadia reportedly failed to meet expectations by “hundreds of thousands”,Business,https://www.xda-developers.com/google-stadia-failed-to-meet-expectations/,"Add swipe gestures to any Android, no rootMake your phone easier to use with one hand, no rootThe best way to access XDA on your phoneA sweet, feature-filled launcher with a beautiful UX.XDA’s official marketplace for buying and selling techPremium videosIt’s been a tough start to the year for Google Stadia. Earlier this month, Google confirmed plans to shut down Stadia’s internal game development division, one week after allegedly praising the studio for its progress. Now, two reports out today have shed light on what it was like on the inside, with one report saying Stadia missed internal targets by “hundreds of thousands.”Wired reports things were bad from the start. Stadia’s initial announcement was splashy and promised to revolutionize the world of gaming with a mix of first and third-party titles. But Google, a company famous for its services, apparently didn’t fully understand what goes into making a successful gaming studio.“Three sources said Google created roadblocks on the very fundamentals of game-making, like withholding permission to use certain game development software (security issues, apparently),” Wired said in its report.Sources also told Wired that Stadia employees felt the service felt like a beta at launch — a sentiment shared by multiple industry reviews. Some features shown off during Stadia’s announcement were missing at launch, and the service debuted with only a handful of big AAA games.“It could have used more testing in different conditions and on different devices,” a source told Wired.A source also said that it felt like Google was funding games to sell Stadia rather than to sell games. While developers were struggling internally, the service failed to meet expectations in 2020, according to both Wired and Bloomberg, the latter of which said the service missed targets for “sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.”Google was so focused on getting games to sell Stadia that it apparently shelled out tens of millions of dollars to get ports of big titles like Red Dead Redemption 2. Jason Schreier, who wrote the Bloomberg piece, said sources told him Google paid tens of millions of dollars per Stadia port.If true, that should be a particularly tough pill to swallow for former employees of Stadia’s now-defunct in-house studio. Phil Harrison, who was picked to lead Google’s Stadia division, cited the exorbitant cost of game development when Google confirmed it was shutting down the service’s in-house studio.Google has confirmed it plans to keep Stadia around, and there has been some good news over the past few weeks. Terraria is coming to Stadia after the developer resolved his personal Google account issues with Google. Journey to the Savage Planet was recently fixed on the platform, too.

352,NFTs Boom as Collectors Shell Out to ‘Own’ Digital Art,Crypto,https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Gian Volpicelli, Wired UKTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.It started with CryptoKitties. In December 2017, the dopey-looking cartoon cats, created by Canadian company Dapper Labs, debuted as tradable collectibles, like Pokémon cards for the bitcoin era. Each image was associated with a unique string of digits—a cryptocurrency “non-fungible token,” or NFT—that could be traded on the Ethereum  blockchain platform as a title deed granting the holder ownership of a particular kitty.This story originally appeared on WIRED UK.The trading game quickly caught on among the crypto-initiated, so much so that CryptoKitties-related transactions clogged and slowed down Ethereum. That was eventually solved—and that was, for most people, the last they heard of CryptoKitties. But the process the goggle-eyed cats set off did not end there. Its end point is an auction that started on Thursday, in which a token associated with a digital collage of 5,000 images by graphic designer Beeple went under the hammer at auction house Christie’s. Cryptocurrency payments were of course accepted.NFTs are selling like hotcakes, and this time the Ethereum network, which has been upgraded since 2017, is better equipped to deal with the endless sloshing. One recent report by NonFungible.com, a company releasing market insights on NFTs, says that in 2020, NFT trading was worth over $250 million, an increase of almost 300 percent from the previous year. On online platforms such as Rarible, OpenSea, and Nifty Gateway (backed by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss), people are shelling out big sums of cryptocurrency and legal tender to buy tokens representing ownership of digital objects, which are then often reauctioned at higher prices. Some of these NFTs are stand-ins for collectibles in the tradition of CryptoKitties—like Non-Fungible Pepes, a postmodern bid to reclaim the meme frog from the alt-right; others are objects intended to be used in video games. But more and more they are linked to pieces of digital art designed by honest-to-God creators such as Beeple—who, two months ago, sold a token for $777,777 on Nifty Gateway.If all of this sounds bizarre, that’s because it is. The idea of paying for the symbolic ownership of a digital image that lives somewhere on the web and can be captured on a screenshot or right-click-download within seconds, is so alien it seems either idiotic or ironic. Yet NFT proponents purport to be solving exactly that problem: the near-impossibility of monetizing digital artworks. “As a mechanism, NFTs make it possible to assign value to digital art, which opens the door to a sea of possibility for a medium that is unbridled by physical limitations,” says Noah Davis, a specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s.Currencies and cryptocurrencies (like the US dollar or bitcoin) are by nature made up of fungible—that is to say, interchangable—units: My two bitcoins are worth the same as your two bitcoins, and if we exchanged them, neither of us would feel stiffed. Currency and cryptocurrency units are also, usually, fractionable into smaller units—dollars can be broken down to cents, bitcoins to particles called satoshis—which can be spent separately. On the contrary, NFTs—cryptocurrency assets developed according to special Ethereum standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155—are unique and indivisible. Where a bitcoin is comparable to a dollar bill, an NFT can be likened to a cat, a sculpture, or a painting: You can’t sell part of it without spoiling the whole, and its value is rather subjective. Those characteristics render NFTs a good metaphor for art. Now, the crypterati and a waxing portion of the art world are asking us to take a leap of faith and believe that by buying an NFT we should feel like the owners of whatever artwork an artist has decided to link with it.This cannot credibly apply to physical artworks. If you are after a Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture, you will likely not be happy with a cryptocurrency token. But when it comes to intangible digital art, NFTs might just do the trick. Sure, everyone can download Beeple’s images from his Instagram feed, but that is missing the point, says Vincent Harrison, a New York gallerist who counts the Winklevosses among his clients and is helping Nifty Gateway attract more established artists onto the platform. “Anyone can see pictures on the internet of the most expensive artworks; posters are sold in museums,” he says. “But it's the ownership that creates value. So with NFTs, not only do you have ownership, you have ownership on the blockchain, you have ownership that is transparent for everyone to see.”NFT technology, Harrison says, provides a way to attach a price tag to digital art, tapping into that primal high-quality hoarding instinct—the quest for status-affording Veblen goods, coveted only insofar as they are pricey—that is behind many collectors’ urge. Mix that with a frothy community eager to trade and meme any new shiny blockchain-adjacent construct to considerable prices and the trick is done.“In this digital world, we have accelerators: Suddenly you could get three or four times what you paid for something—tomorrow there is someone ready to buy it,” Harrison says. Even better, blockchains are also able to keep track in a secure, immutable way of how a token originated and changed hands over time. “Provenance is obviously an important part of the value of art,” Harrison says.The crowd buying NFT-linked art is varied. Some of its members are cryptocurrency magnates looking for the newest thing to plunge their savings into. “People who were early in crypto and have a bunch of ether [Ethereum’s cryptocurrency], they're looking for ways to use it,” says James Beck, director of communications and content at ConsenSys, a blockchain company that has built an app to store and manage NFTs. They want to show, Beck says, that they are “patrons of the art on the internet.”It helps that some NFT marketplaces allow people to showcase their purchases like in an online gallery or museum. Jamie Burke, founder and CEO of blockchain investment firm Outlier Ventures and an NFT enthusiast, is one of those keen about their newfound role as digital arts supporters. Burke says that he was initially turned off by the early, “self-referential” cryptocurrency-focused artworks—strewn with Bitcoin signs and pixelated memes. But when he got more interested in the space, in summer 2020, he was “blown away” by the new artists.“This was art in and of its own right that I would buy, and I liked the idea that I could have a unique digital edition of it,” he says. “I just started collecting, personally, and trying to get new artists and professionals who are coming into the space. I'm building a bit of a collection.” That does not mean he turns down a good deal when it presents itself. On February 13, he sold an NFT he had paid $500 for, for $20,000 in ether. Announcing the sale in a tweet, Burke said he would use the return to buy more art.Harrison says that while the market right now is crawling with speculators who would buy and flip any blockchain-based asset in the hope that it increases in value, bona fide collectors are increasingly getting involved. “It's a combination of people who are just speculative and people who want to collect and have something cool,” he says. “My role is to balance an element of speculation with enough people that want to buy something because they like it, and they want a hot collection habit. If everyone is buying to speculate, it doesn't work, then it just becomes another tradable token.”Some digital artists are welcoming of the trend. Most platforms are simple to use, allowing them to upload their works, automatically “mint” NFTs, and wait for the offers to rain in—and these are often higher than the sums they would receive if they tried to sell their digital artworks online or as prints. Brendan Dawes, a UK graphic designer and artist who creates digital imagery using machine learning and algorithms, says that a print of one of his pieces would typically sell for $2,000, while his latest NFT sold for $37,000.The profits don’t stop there. NFTs can be designed to pay their creators a cryptocurrency fee every time they change hands. If a buyer of one of Dawes’ pieces resells it, Dawes automatically receives 10 percent of the price paid. “That's again one of the differences when compared to the traditional world. You get this ongoing royalty.”Andrea Bonaceto, a venture capitalist and artist who is also creating NFT-backed artwork, thinks that the method might spur new forms of digital art blending digital imagery, music, and technology. “You can create hybrids of art and music, or of art and literature, and link both of them to a token. You can use smart contracts [self-executing routines that can be programmed onto a blockchain] so that the artwork changes over time,” he says. “This totally opens up an artist’s creativity.”Crypto being crypto, NFTs are bound to produce excesses. Some of the prices paid can be beyond comprehension, the epitome being the purchase of a virtual racing car for $100,000; and the fact that some websites are offering cryptocurrency loans in exchange for NFT collaterals has all the signs of a mini-crash waiting to happen.At a more basic level, William O'Rorke, a partner at Paris-based law firm ORWL Avocats, says that while the structure of NFTs—modeled after artwork rather than currencies or shares—means they are not subjected to the kind of financial regulation other kinds of crypto assets have to abide by, they still risk falling foul of intellectual property law (for instance, if selling someone else’s artwork as one’s own) and consumer law protection.Online auctions are another potential quagmire, O’Rorke says, as sellers could potentially leverage fake accounts to tamper with the bidding process. “If you have 10 accounts, you can artificially increase the price of an NFT,” he says. “This kind of practice exists actually also on eBay, on all these kinds of services. But when people participate in the auction with anonymous cryptocurrency, it's much more complicated to find out.” Luckily, he says, there are techniques and methods to detect coordination that could stave off the worst.In general, O’Rorke sees NFT art as a “spectacular” trend, but at the end of the day, smaller than other sectors in which NFTs are likely to take hold—from gaming to sports trading cards—as more and more brands, including toy manufacturer Superplastic and Nike get acquainted with the technology.The big question is, then, whether this is just another cryptocurrency fad, or whether NFT art is here for good. Harrison has no doubt that what has been happening is just the beginning of a long-awaited transition, partly triggered by the pandemic-induced closures of museums and galleries. “There's something real here. This is just an acceleration of a cultural shift,” he says.Federica Beretta, gallery director at London-based Opera Gallery, says that while the pandemic, and a push for sustainability, made turning to digital artwork and digital auctions a “no brainer,” physical art will probably keep an edge in the long run. “The digital world offers extraordinary opportunities to artists, collectors, museums, and galleries, and it could also be seen as a fantastic complement to traditional art,” she says. “I do not believe art will become only digital in the future.”This story originally appeared on WIRED UK.WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

353,ICE investigators used a private utility database covering millions to pursue immigration violations,Privacy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/26/ice-private-utility-data/,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have tapped a private database containing hundreds of millions of phone, water, electricity and other utility records while pursuing immigration violations, according to public documents uncovered by Georgetown Law researchers and shared with The Washington Post.ICE’s use of the private database is another example of how government agencies have exploited commercial sources to access information they are not authorized to compile on their own. It also highlights how real-world surveillance efforts are being fueled by information people may never have expected would land in the hands of law enforcement.The database, CLEAR, includes more than 400 million names, addresses and service records from more than 80 utility companies covering all the staples of modern life, including water, gas and electricity, and phone, Internet and cable TV.CLEAR documents say the database includes billions of records related to people’s employment, housing, credit reports, criminal histories and vehicle registrations from utility companies in all 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is updated daily, meaning even a recent move or new utility sign-up could be reflected in an individual search.CLEAR is run by the media and data conglomerate Thomson Reuters, which sells “legal investigation software solution” subscriptions to a broad range of companies and public agencies. The company has said in documents that its utility data comes from the credit-reporting giant Equifax. Thomson Reuters, based in Toronto, also owns the international news service Reuters as well as other prominent subscription databases, including Westlaw.Thomson Reuters has not provided a full client list for CLEAR, but the company has said in marketing documents that the system has been used by police in Detroit, a credit union in California and a fraud investigator in the Midwest. Federal purchasing records show that the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Defense are among the federal agencies with ongoing contracts for CLEAR data use.Biden memo for ICE officers points to fewer deportations and strict oversightOn Friday, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent letters to the chief executives of Thomson Reuters and Equifax seeking documents and other information on how ICE has used the utility data in recent years.“We are concerned that Thomson Reuters’ commercialization of personal and use data of utility customers and sale of broad access to ICE is an abuse of privacy, and that ICE’s use of this database is an abuse of power,” said the letters, which were signed by Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), the committee’s vice chair, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), the chairman of a subcommittee on economic and consumer policy.Thomson Reuters directed requests for comment to ICE, which declined to comment on its “investigative techniques, tactics or tools,” citing “law-enforcement sensitivities.” Equifax did not respond to requests for comment.ICE has not shared how often it has used utility records to track people, saying such details should be confidential because they outline protected investigative techniques.But an immigration-case investigator appeared to note the access last June in an email to officials at the Georgia Department of Driver Services. The email was revealed as part of a Freedom of Information Act request by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology and reviewed by The Post. In the heavily redacted email, the officer said immigration authorities are pursuing a “straight-up Pleasure Visitor” accused of overstaying a visa and that a search of unspecified utility records had showed that the target had “recently departed” from an address.ICE has run facial-recognition searches on millions of Maryland driversIn a separate letter to a Texas sheriff’s office in 2019, also obtained by Georgetown researchers and shared with The Post, a Thomson Reuters specialist said CLEAR’s utility data offered investigators a powerful way to find “people who are not easily traceable via traditional sources.”Nina Wang, a policy associate at the Georgetown center, said the database offered ICE officers a way to pursue undocumented immigrants who may have tried to stay off the grid by avoiding activities such as getting driver’s licenses but could not live without paying to keep the lights on at home.“There needs to be a line drawn in defense of people’s basic dignity. And when the fear of deportation could endanger their ability to access these basic services, that line is being crossed,” she said. “It’s a massive betrayal of people’s trust. … When you sign up for electricity, you don’t expect them to send immigration agents to your front door.”ICE has a $21 million contract with a Thomson Reuters subsidiary for the data, though the subscription is scheduled to expire on Sunday. ICE published a new solicitation for a “Law Enforcement Investigative Database Subscription” in November, but it is unclear whether the Biden administration will renew the deal or award a new contract.ICE is tapping into a huge license-plate database, ACLU says, raising new privacy concerns about surveillanceJacinta Gonzalez, a senior campaign organizer at the Latino civil rights group Mijente, said her group has been alarmed and “horrified” by how quickly ICE has expanded its surveillance network through the use of private databases, which members suspect have been used by ICE officers to plan raids on people’s homes.“People would say to us, ‘How did ICE get my address? I’ve never had interactions with the police, I’ve never used this address publicly,’” she said. “It puts people in a tremendously difficult situation. They have to decide whether to have electricity or subject themselves to having ICE get access to this information.”Equifax has said it gathers utility-bill records from the National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange, a consumer-credit reporting bureau that gathers data on people’s account and payment history with companies including Verizon and AT&T.The data-exchange bureau has defended its data collection as “empowering” for the “underserved and underbanked community,” because the records help big companies assess the creditworthiness of people by using “alternative data sources” beyond traditional credit reports.FBI, ICE find state driver’s license photos are a gold mine for facial-recognition searchesIt’s unclear whether the utility data from Equifax comes from NCTUE or some other source, though the two firms have a long-standing data-sharing agreement. Speaking of the partnership in a letter to the Justice Department in 2001, a NCTUE representative wrote that Equifax had a “commitment to find and exploit appropriate opportunities for third-party access to exchange data.”Federal laws such as the Privacy Act of 1974 regulate how federal agencies can gather or use Americans’ personal information, but they do not cover CLEAR or other private databases, and federal law enforcement has increasingly turned to them for information it otherwise is not allowed to collect without a court order.Immigration agents have accessed information from a private database of license-plate readers holding billions of records related to vehicle locations from scanners on tow trucks, toll roads and speed-limit cameras. Agents have run facial recognition searches on people’s photos to see if they match any of the millions of faces in state driver’s license databases.U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials also have used cellphone location data without warrants to track people inside the country. The data is gathered through a mix of weather, gaming and other apps, then bundled and resold by companies to marketers and federal agencies.An inspector general for the Treasury Department said in a letter last week to Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), first reported by the Wall Street Journal, that similar uses of commercial location data by the Internal Revenue Service could conflict with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that found such searches should require a warrant.Lawyers for the IRS and other agencies have argued that they had not needed a warrant because phone users had “voluntarily granted access” to the data-sharing apps.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

It combines sophisticated model inspection and model-based simulation to enable better
explanations of your supervised machine learning models.FACET is composed of the following key components:      Model InspectionFACET introduces a new algorithm to quantify dependencies and
interactions between features in ML models.
This new tool for human-explainable AI adds a new, global
perspective to the observation-level explanations provided by the
popular SHAP approach.
To learn more about FACET’s model inspection capabilities, see the
getting started example below.      Model SimulationFACET’s model simulation algorithms use ML models for
virtual experiments to help identify scenarios that optimise
predicted outcomes.
To quantify the uncertainty in simulations, FACET utilises a range
of bootstrapping algorithms including stationary and stratified
bootstraps.
For an example of FACET’s bootstrap simulations, see the
quickstart example below.      Enhanced Machine Learning WorkflowFACET offers an efficient and transparent machine learning
workflow, enhancing
scikit-learn's
tried and tested pipelining paradigm with new capabilities for model
selection, inspection, and simulation.
FACET also introduces
sklearndf
[documentation]
an augmented version of scikit-learn with enhanced support for
pandas data frames that ensures end-to-end traceability of features.
 
  


 
 
 
FACET supports both PyPI and Anaconda.The following quickstart guide provides a minimal example workflow to get you
up and running with FACET. For additional tutorials and the API guide see
the FACET documentation.To demonstrate the model inspection capability of FACET, we first create a
pipeline to fit a learner. In this simple example we use the
diabetes dataset
which contains age, sex, BMI and blood pressure along with 6 blood serum
measurements as features. A transformed version of this dataset is also available
on scikit-learn
here.In this quickstart we will train a Random Forest regressor using 10 repeated
5-fold CV to predict disease progression after one year. With the use of
sklearndf we can create a pandas DataFrame compatible workflow. However,
FACET provides additional enhancements to keep track of our feature matrix
and target vector using a sample object (Sample) and easily compare
hyperparameter configurations and even multiple learners with the LearnerRanker.We can see based on this minimal workflow that a value of 11 for minimum
samples in the leaf was the best performing of the three considered values.
This approach easily extends to multiple hyperparameters for the learner
and multiple learners.FACET implements several model inspection methods for
scikit-learn estimators.
FACET enhances model inspection by providing global metrics that complement
the local perspective of SHAP. The key global metrics for each pair of
features in a model are:SynergyThe degree to which the model combines information from one feature with
another to predict the target. For example, let's assume we are predicting
cardiovascular health using age and gender and the fitted model includes
a complex interaction between them. This means these two features are
synergistic for predicting cardiovascular health. Further, both features
are important to the model and removing either one would significantly
impact performance. Let's assume age brings more information to the joint
contribution than gender. This asymmetric contribution means the synergy for
(age, gender) is less than the synergy for (gender, age). To think about it another
way, imagine the prediction is a coordinate you are trying to reach.
From your starting point, age gets you much closer to this point than
gender, however, you need both to get there. Synergy reflects the fact
that gender gets more help from age (higher synergy from the perspective
of gender) than age does from gender (lower synergy from the perspective of
age) to reach the prediction. This leads to an important point: synergy
is a naturally asymmetric property of the global information two interacting
features contribute to the model predictions. Synergy is expressed as a
percentage ranging from 0% (full autonomy) to 100% (full synergy).RedundancyThe degree to which a feature in a model duplicates the information of a
second feature to predict the target. For example, let's assume we had
house size and number of bedrooms for predicting house price. These
features capture similar information as the more bedrooms the larger
the house and likely a higher price on average. The redundancy for
(number of bedrooms, house size) will be greater than the redundancy
for (house size, number of bedrooms). This is because house size
""knows"" more of what number of bedrooms does for predicting house price
than vice-versa. Hence, there is greater redundancy from the perspective
of number of bedrooms. Another way to think about it is removing house
size will be more detrimental to model performance than removing number
of bedrooms, as house size can better compensate for the absence of
number of bedrooms. This also implies that house size would be a more
important feature than number of bedrooms in the model. The important
point here is that like synergy, redundancy is a naturally asymmetric
property of the global information feature pairs have for predicting
an outcome. Redundancy is expressed as a percentage ranging from 0%
(full uniqueness) to 100% (full redundancy).SynergyFor any feature pair (A, B), the first feature (A) is the row, and the second
feature (B) the column. For example, looking across the row for LTG (Lamotrigine)
there is relatively minimal synergy (≤14%) with other features in the model.
However, looking down the column for LTG (i.e., perspective of other features
in a pair with LTG) we find many features (the rows) are synergistic (12% to 34%)
with LTG. We can conclude that:High synergy features must be considered carefully when investigating impact,
as they work together to predict the outcome. It would not make much sense to
consider TC (T-Cells) without LTG given the 34% synergy of TC with LTG
for predicting progression after one year.RedundancyFor any feature pair (A, B), the first feature (A) is the row, and the second feature
(B) the column. For example, if we look at the feature pair (LDL, TC) from the
perspective of LDL (Low-Density Lipoproteins), then we look-up the row for LDL
and the column for TC and find 47% redundancy. This means that 47% of the
information in LDL is duplicated with TC to predict disease progression
after one year. This redundancy is similar when looking ""from the perspective""
of TC for (TC, LDL) which is 50%.If we look across the columns for the LTG row we can see that apart from the
32% redundancy with BMI, LTG has minimal redundancy (<9%) with the other
features included in the model. Further, if we look cross the rows for the
LTG column we can see a number of the features have moderate redundancy
with LTG.Clustering redundancyAs detailed above redundancy and synergy for a feature pair is from the
""perspective"" of one of the features in the pair, and so yields two distinct
values. However, a symmetric version can also be computed that provides not
only a simplified perspective but allows the use of (1 - metric) as a
feature distance. With this distance hierarchical, single linkage clustering
is applied to create a dendrogram visualization. This helps to identify
groups of low distance, features which activate ""in tandem"" to predict the
outcome. Such information can then be used to either reduce clusters of
highly redundant features to a subset or highlight clusters of highly
synergistic features that should always be considered together.Let's look at the example for redundancy.Based on the dendrogram we can see that the feature pairs (LDL, TC)
and (LTG, BMI: body mass index) each represent a cluster in the
dendrogram and that LTG and BMI have high the highest importance.
As potential next actions we could remove TC and explore the impact of
removing one of LTG or BMI to further simplify the model and obtain a
reduced set of independent features.Please see the
API reference
for more detail.Taking the BMI feature as an example, we do the following for the simulation:Finally, because FACET can use bootstrap cross validation, we can create a crossfit
from our previous LearnerRanker best model to perform the simulation so we can
quantify the uncertainty by using bootstrap confidence intervals.We would conclude from the figure that higher values of BMI are associated with
an increase in disease progression after one year, and that for a BMI of 29
and above, there is a significant increase in disease progression after one year
of at least 26 points.FACET is stable and is being supported long-term.Contributions to FACET are welcome and appreciated.

357,An aggressive market-driven model for US fusion power development,Business,https://news.mit.edu/2021/aggressive-market-driven-model-us-fusion-power-development-0224,"Suggestions or feedback?

Electricity generated by fusion power plants could play an important role in decarbonizing the U.S. energy sector by mid-century, says a new consensus study report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which also lays out for the first time a set of technical, economic, and regulatory standards and a timeline for a U.S. fusion pilot plant that would begin producing energy in the 2035-40 time frame.To achieve this key step toward commercialization, the report calls for an aggressive public-private effort to produce by 2028 a pilot plant design that can, when built, accommodate any of the developmental approaches seeking to realize fusion’s potential as a safe, carbon-free, on-demand energy source.These include what it calls the “leading fusion concept, a deuterium-tritium fueled tokamak,” like that being pursued at MIT spinout Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) with support from the Institute’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) and Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, notes that “the report can be seen as confirming and validating the vision that motivated the founding of CFS in 2018.” The new report follows and extends a 2018 National Academies study that (while acknowledging the significant scientific and technical challenges still faced by fusion) saw promise in the tokamak approach, called for continued U.S. participation in the international ITER fusion experiment, and suggested a pilot plant effort .PSFC director and Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte helped develop the new study as a member of the National Academies’ Committee on the Key Goals and Innovation Needed for a U.S. Fusion Pilot Plant, which also included representatives from other universities, national laboratories, and private companies. It sought out a broad range of expertise from government, academic, and private-sector sources, including U.S. utilities and energy companies.  “The biggest thing,” says Whyte, is that the diverse group “came to a consensus that fusion is relevant, and that this effort is important.” Driving factors include utility industry commitments to deep cuts in carbon emissions in coming decades, along with a combination of simultaneous synergistic advances in fusion science and technology, application of new resources from areas outside the traditional fusion community, and particularly the rise of interest in private fusion developers like CFS, which collectively have received some $2 billion in funding in recent years.There has also been a broad pivot by much of the nation’s fusion research community away from a focus on science and toward a mission of practical energy production. This consensus was expressed in a recent report by the Federal Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC) that urged the nation to “move aggressively toward the deployment of fusion energy, which could substantially power modern society while mitigating climate change,” and suggested development of a pilot plant. The new National Academies study advances the concept with specifics on what a successful pilot plant would look like.The report’s authors took a marketplace-driven approach to defining the pilot plant’s characteristics, based on discussions with utilities and other energy-sector organizations that would ultimately be the builders, owners, and operators of fusion generating facilities, says Whyte. “Setting those goal posts is very important, laying out the technical, regulatory, and economic performance requirements for the pilot plant,” he explains. “They’re demanding, but they should be, because that’s what’s needed to make fusion viable.”Those requirements include a total pilot plant cost of less than $5-6 billion and generating capacity of at least 50 megawatts. In addition to proving the ability to create reliable, sustained net energy gain and power production from fusion for steadily increasing periods of time, says the report, the plant must provide “cost certainty to the marketplace in terms of capital cost, construction time, control of radioactive effluents including tritium, the cost of electricity, and the maintenance/operating schedule and cost.”These results would inform subsequent construction of first-of-a-kind commercial fusion plants in the 2040s, and then broader propagation of fusion energy facilities onto the grid around mid-century, by which time major U.S. utilities have committed to deep reductions in their carbon emissions.A key near-term factor in achieving these goals is formation of multiple public-private teams to conceptualize and design aspects of the pilot plant over the next seven years. These include improved fusion confinement and control, materials that can withstand the withering temperatures and stresses produced during fusion, methods of extracting fusion-generated heat and harnessing it for generation, and development of a closed fuel cycle. All are technically challenging and also require close attention to cost, manufacturability, maintainability, and other system-level considerations.Combining resources from national labs, academic institutions, and private industry is a good approach to addressing these tasks, says Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC and senior research scientist. “Technologies like fusion come to market through the private sector, especially in the U.S., and once you understand that you can see appropriate roles for government labs that can do basic research, universities that are free to work with private industry, and companies that can use their own capital to pick up and commercialize the work.” Private space programs provide an example, he notes, with companies building rockets and using NASA facilities for things like testing and launch.“The question,” adds Greenwald, “is whether we can collectively gather the resources and investments and execute in a way that meets the pace. We don’t want to be complacent about how audacious this is, but we have to be audacious if we’re going to meet the need.”Bob Mumgaard, chief executive officer of CFS, says the new report is another indication of fusion’s growing momentum. In addition to the two National Academies studies, growing private investment, and FESAC’s community-driven recommendations, he points to the January enactment of federal appropriations legislation that funded both domestic and international fusion activities, including ongoing participation in ITER.“For first time in 40 years, the U.S. government has a policy of building a new energy industry, a whole ecosystem,” says Mumgaard. “The legislation sort of pre-authorized many of the things the National Academies report says are good ideas, like the pivot into energy technology, the more-aggressive timeline, and getting regulation sorted out, which is going pretty well, actually — that’s all in the bill. It lays the groundwork for the broad community to take all this to heart and start doing the work. It’s very different from isolated companies doing their own thing, and universities running experiments, and has been very rapid in terms of how these things usually go. We are entering a whole new era for fusion.”Cecil and Ida Green Professor Emeritus Ernest Moniz, who served as U.S. secretary of energy during the Obama administration, adds that “The academy report alerts the scientific community, the Congress, and the Biden Administration, which is prioritizing climate change risk mitigation, to the incredible progress over the last years towards fusion as a viable energy source — innovation along several technology pathways, supported largely by private capital. Public-private partnerships can help take several of these technologies to demonstrations in this decade, allowing fusion to be a critical enabler of a decarbonized electric grid before mid-century.”

358,'Spooky' AI tool brings dead relatives' photos to life,Software,https://news.trust.org/item/20210226144936-jxdi4/,"ARCHIVE PHOTO: A software engineer works on a facial recognition program in Beijing as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus , China, March 6, 2020.  REUTERS/Thomas PeterBy Umberto BacchiFeb 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like the animated paintings that adorn the walls of Harry Potter's school, a new online tool promises to bring portraits of dead relatives to life, stirring debate about the use of technology to impersonate people.Genealogy company MyHeritage launched its ""Deep Nostalgia"" feature earlier this week, allowing users to turn stills into short videos showing the person in the photograph smiling, winking and nodding.""Seeing our beloved ancestors' faces come to life ... lets us imagine how they might have been in reality, and provides a profound new way of connecting to our family history,"" MyHeritage founder Gilad Japhet said in a statement.Developed with Israeli computer vision firm D-ID, Deep Nostalgia uses deep learning algorithms to animate images with facial expressions that were based on those of MyHeritage employees.Some of the company's users took to Twitter on Friday to share the animated images of their deceased relatives, as well as moving depictions of historical figures, including Albert Einstein and Ancient Egypt's lost Queen Nefertiti.""Takes my breath away. This is my grandfather who died when I was eight. @MyHeritage brought him back to life. Absolutely crazy,"" wrote Twitter user Jenny Hawran.While most expressed amazement, others described the feature as ""spooky"" and said it raised ethical questions. ""The photos are enough. The dead have no say in this,"" tweeted user Erica Cervini.From chatbots to virtual reality, the tool is the latest innovation seeking to bring the dead to life through technology.Last year U.S. rapper Kanye West famously gifted his wife Kim Kardashian a hologram of her late father congratulating her on her birthday and on marrying ""the most, most, most, most, most genius man in the whole world"".'ANIMATING THE PAST'The trend has opened up all sorts of ethical and legal questions, particularly around consent and the opportunity to blur reality by recreating a virtual doppelganger of the living.Elaine Kasket a psychology professor at the University of Wolverhampton in Britain who authored a book on the ""digital afterlife"", said that while Deep Nostalgia was not necessarily ""problematic"", it sat ""at the top of a slippery slope"".""When people start overwriting history or sort of animating the past ... You wonder where that ends up,"" she said.MyHeritage acknowledges on its website that the technology can be ""a bit uncanny"" and its use ""controversial"", but said steps have been taken to prevent abuses.""The Deep Nostalgia feature includes hard-coded animations that are intentionally without any speech and therefore cannot be used to fake any content or deliver any message,"" MyHeritage public relations director Rafi Mendelsohn said in a statement.Yet, images alone can convey meaning, said Faheem Hussain, a clinical assistant professor at Arizona State University's School for the Future of Innovation in Society.""Imagine somebody took a picture of the Last Supper and Judas is now winking at Mary Magdalene - what kind of implications that can have,"" Hussain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.Similarly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) animations could be use to make someone appear as though they were doing things they might not be happy about, such as rolling their eyes or smiling at a funeral, he added.Mendelsohn of MyHeritage said using photos of a living person without their consent was a breach of the company's terms and conditions, adding that videos were clearly marked with AI symbols to differentiate them from authentic recordings.""It is our ethical responsibility to mark such synthetic videos clearly and differentiate them from real videos,"" he said.Related stories:'Draconian' moves to control internet in AsiaHalf London councils found using Chinese surveillance tech linked to Uighur abusesTrans model Munroe Bergdorf urges social media giants to tackle abuse (Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi in Milan; Editing by Helen Popper.

359,US Pentagon’s space-based energy beam could one day power entire cities,Energy,https://metro.co.uk/2021/02/25/pentagons-space-based-energy-beam-could-one-day-power-entire-cities-14143233/,"NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW ITScientists have successfully tested a floating solar panel in space that will eventually beam energy back to Earth.The size of a computer monitor, the prototype energy harvester is a project of the US Pentagon, which scientists hope could one day power entire cities.Named the Photovoltaic Radiofrequency Antenna Module (PRAM), the solar panel was launched in May last year, as part of the the Pentagon’s secretive X-37B unmanned drone.Rotating around the earth every 90 minutes, PRAM is well positioned above the Earth’s atmosphere to make use of the sun’s light that doesn’t reach below.The light above the atmosphere is of a higher frequency – and so higher energy – than the light that’s been bounced around the Earth’s gravity-bound gases.‘We’re getting a ton of extra sunlight in space just because of that,’ co-developer Paul Jaffe told CNN.‘Some visions have space solar matching or exceeding the largest power plants today — multiple gigawatts – so enough for a city,’ Jaffe added.So far, PRAM can only produce enough power to power a tablet computer – but the panel is only a small prototype.Scaled up, in both size and number, the project could transform how power is generated and distributed across the globe.The additional power could support the largest electrical grids on Earth.While the satellite hasn’t yet sent its harvested energy back to terra firma, the power transmission technology has been previously proven to work.Solar energy, once collected by the photovoltaic cells floating in space, will beam microwaves home by giant space antennae, likely kilometers-wide.Once the beam reaches below, the waves could then be converted to carbon-free electricity.‘The unique advantage the solar power satellites have over any other source of power is this global transmissibility,’ Jaffe said.‘You can send power to Chicago and a fraction of a second later, if you needed, send it instead to London or Brasilia.’A stumbling block for the project, though, could be whether it’s economically viable.‘Building hardware for space is expensive,’ Jaffe added.‘Those [costs] are, in the last 10 years, finally starting to come down.’However, there are some positives to building things in space.‘On Earth, we have this pesky gravity, which is helpful in that it keeps things in place, but is a problem when you start to build very large things, as they have to support their own weight,’ Jaffe said.While the details of PRAM have just become public knowledge, the other purposes of the top-secret X-37B drone remain cloaked in secrecy.The first results highlighting the solar panel’s efficacy were released in January, in IEEE Journal of Microwaves.A joint project between the Pentagon, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund and the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, it’s unknown how much money has been earmarked for the experiment.A final version of PRAM would likely orbit at a much higher orbit than the current test model, as sunlight is more plentiful from less time spent in the shade of the Earth.While there would be more energy higher up, the onboard electronics would be less efficient after heating effects from the additional sunlight.However, scientists installed onboard heaters on the current version of PRAM to try and model this effect and prove its efficacy regardless of orbital height.‘The next logical step is to scale it up to a larger area that collects more sunlight, that converts more into microwaves,’ Jaffe said.Could the beam be accidentally directed to the wrong place on Earth and cause untold havoc?Not if the scientists can help it – using a technique called ‘retro-directive beam control’, the Earth’s receiver would send a signal to the space antenna so it knows exactly where to send the beam.Jaffe also said that fears of a giant space laser created by bad actors are unwarranted, as the antenna size required for such a device would be noticed months or years before it was assembled.He added that it would be ‘exceedingly difficult, if not impossible’ to weaponise the solar energy.

Joel Rosenblatt, Bloomberg NewsWhen Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity? The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users.At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices in a class-action lawsuit that describes the company’s private browsing promises as a “ruse” and seeks US$5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising. Google has become a target of antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, argued the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said.Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company. “I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers.

362,Galaxy S21 drop test: Samsung's newest phones didn't last long,Hardware,https://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-s21-drop-test-samsung-breaks-at-first-drop/,"Our S21 broke on the first drop, while the S21 Ultra didn't fare much better. But there's a silver lining...I had high hopes for the new Samsung Galaxy S21 phones phones going into our drop test, even though Galaxy phones haven't been the most durable in our previous tests. The S21, S21 Plus and S21 Ultra's curved displays aren't as pronounced as previous models and all the screens are covered in the strongest Gorilla Glass. But let's just say my hopes proved optimistic, and if you're considering going case-less with your new Galaxy S21, you may want to read on. While the three Galaxy S21 phones may look similar, the backs are all made of different materials. The S21 Plus and Ultra have glass on either side, while the back of the regular S21 is made of plastic. Because this difference could affect the durability of the phone, we decided to test out both the $1,200 (£1,149, AU$1,849) Galaxy Ultra and the $800 (£769, AU$1,249) Galaxy S21 simultaneously.A lot of factors go into the durability of the screen, including the shape and thickness of the glass the manufacturer decides to use. We know from our previous Note 20 Ultra drop test that even the strongest Gorilla Glass Victus is no match for pavement, with the screen cracking on the second drop from hip height. But that doesn't mean the S21's screen will share the same fate: The two have different designs and the thick metal casing protecting the camera looks sturdier than the all-glass module on previous Galaxy phones. For our drop test, CNET Senior Video Producer Chris Parker dropped a brand new phantom violet Galaxy S21 and phantom black Galaxy S21 Ultra onto a concrete sidewalk. Discover the latest news and best reviews in smartphones and carriers from CNET's mobile experts.The drop from pocket or hip height is one of the most common causes of cracked screens, especially if your phone lands on a rough surface like a sidewalk. We start all our tests at this height. The cracked screen of the Samsung Galaxy S21 after the first drop from hip height. The top left hand corner of the phone opposite the camera hit the ground first, then the bottom corner hit, then the entire right side of the phone. This caused it to bounce back up a bit and land screen-side-down on the floor.The bottom left hand corner of the glass had shattered with a few larger cracks stemming outward from the point of impact including a big dome-shaped one running through the middle of the screen. The S21 Ultra after the first drop from hip-height: one small crack at the top. The initial impact of the drop seemed to be distributed relatively evenly as the phone hit the floor, with the top edge of the screen hitting the sidewalk just a bit earlier than the rest. It then jumped back into the air, flipped around and landed screen-side-up. The top edge of the metal frame on the S21 Ultra had what looked like silver sand particles where the paint was scraped, but the screen looked OK. That is, until we noticed a tiny crack on the top left-hand corner of the phone. It was small enough that it probably wouldn't bother you if you kept using the phone, but it was damaged nonetheless and not the ideal scenario after just one drop.To test the durability of the back, Chris dropped the phones from the same height with the screen facing up. We obviously weren't expecting the plastic back on the S21 to break, but we wanted to see what kind of damage it would incur and how the camera would hold up to the fall. The back of the Samsung Galaxy S21 had a few minor scratches after the second drop from hip-height. The top half of the phone hit the ground first, then the bottom edge causing it to jump in the air and complete a couple of flips before landing back on the sidewalk with the back side facing up. Save for a few tiny scrapes on the bottom, there was barely any damage on the plastic back cover, as we expected.The camera was also in good shape, with no visible damage to the module or any of its three lenses, which are carved into the metal casing. Unlike previous Galaxy models where the entire camera bump is covered in glass, the module on the S21 is mostly metal and only the lenses are glass.The broken back of the Galaxy S21 Ultra after the second drop from hip height. The phone hit the floor almost flat, bounced a bit and flipped on its side causing it to land with its back facing up. The glass back on the S21 Ultra didn't survive. It had multiple fractures stemming from the bottom left hand corner and running up the entire back of the phone and a few loose pieces of glass coming off the corner where it hit.The camera module on the other hand survived relatively unscathed, except for a couple small dings on the metal casing.Both phones were cracked at this point, but we decided to drop them one last time on the side which had sustained the least amount of damage. The back of the Galaxy S21 sustained minimal damage after three drops with just a few scratches on the metal casing. The weight of the camera module must play a part in the landing, because this is what broke the fall yet again. With the camera hitting first, the phone then bounced on the opposite side and did a few flips in the air before settling screen-side-up on the floor. As expected, the back of the phone was still in good shape, but with some more pronounced scrapes towards the bottom. The top left hand corner of the metal camera module, which broke the fall, also had noticeable scratches. But the lenses remained intact. The shattered front of the Galaxy S21 Ultra after a drop from 6 feet. The phone landed almost completely flat, bounced up a bit and then hit the floor again face first.The tiny crack on the top corner multiplied into an entire web of cracks covering almost the entire front of the phone. Some were deep enough to penetrate the screen and black out part of the OLED panel. The screen still responded to touch, but there were tiny shards of glass coming off it, so you wouldn't have wanted to keep using it, even with a screen protector on top. The cracks on the back had also continued to grow, though they weren't nearly as bad as the ones on the front. Allstate Protection Plans conducted a similar drop test on all three Galaxy S21 models with similar results. The screens shattered after the first drop (in this case from 6 feet). The back side of the S21 Plus and S21 Ultra also shattered after the second drop from the same height (back side down).While our tests are by no means scientific and your results may be completely different if you drop your phone, our Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Ultra cracked on the first drop, which was disappointing. The S21 has an edge over the Ultra as the back probably won't break even if you drop it multiple times. But you'll still need to put a case on it to shield the screen and I'd consider investing in a screen protector as an added layer of protection as repairing the S21's screen starts at $200. The silver lining is that the camera modules on both phones, which are more expensive to repair, seem to be sturdier than in previous modules thanks to the new metal casing. We reached out to Samsung for comment on our results, but did not hear back at publication time."
363,"Stop global roll out of 5G networks until safety is confirmed, urges expert",Society,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/b-sgr011421.php,"EurekAlert! provides eligible reporters with free access to embargoed and breaking news releases.EurekAlert! offers eligible public information officers paid access to a reliable news release distribution service.EurekAlert! is a service of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Transmitter density means greater population exposure to high levels of radio frequency electromagnetic fieldsBMJResearch NewsWe should err on the side of caution and stop the global roll out of 5G (fifth generation) telecoms networks until we are certain this technology is completely safe, urges an expert in an opinion piece published online in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.There are no health concerns about 5G and COVID-19, despite what conspiracy theorists have suggested. But the transmitter density required for 5G means that more people will be exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs), and at levels that emerging evidence suggests, are potentially harmful to health, argues Professor John William Frank, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh.The advent of 5G technology has been hailed by governments and certain vested interests as transformative, promising clear economic and lifestyle benefits, through massively boosting wireless and mobile connectivity at home, work, school and in the community, he says.But it has become the subject of fierce controversy, fuelled by four key areas of scientific uncertainty and concern.The lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; and a growing but far from comprehensive body of laboratory research indicating the biologically disruptive potential of RF-EMFs  
An almost total lack (as yet) of high quality epidemiological studies of the impact on human health from 5G EMF exposure
Mounting epidemiological evidence of such effects from previous generations of RF-EMF exposure at lower levels
Persistent allegations that some national telecomms regulatory authorities haven't based their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, amid potential conflicts of interest
5G uses much higher frequency (3 to 300GHz) radio waves than in the past and it makes use of very new--and relatively unevaluated, in terms of safety--supportive technology to enable this higher data transmission capacity, points out Professor Frank.Its inherent fragility means that transmission boosting 'cell' antennae are generally required every 100-300 m--which is far more spatially dense than the transmission masts required for older 2G, 3G and 4G technology, using lower frequency waves, he says.A dense transmission network is also required to achieve the 'everywhere/anytime' connectivity promised by 5G developers.Existing 4G systems can service up to 4000 radio frequency-using devices per square kilometre; 5G systems will connect up to one million devices per square kilometre--greatly increasing the speed of data transfer (by a factor of 10) and the volume of data transmitted (by a factor of 1000), he explains.While several major reviews of the existing evidence on the potential health harms of 5G have been published over the past decade, these have been of ""varying scientific quality,"" suggests Professor Frank.And they have not stopped the clamour from ""a growing number of engineers, scientists, and doctors internationally...calling on governments to raise their safety standards for RF-EMFs, commission more and better research, and hold off on further increases in public exposure, pending clearer evidence of safety,"" he writes.Permitted maximum safety limits for RF-EMF exposure vary considerably around the world, he points out.What's more, '5G systems' is not a consistently defined term, comprising quite different specific technologies and components.""It is highly likely that each of these many forms of transmission causes somewhat different biological effects--making sound, comprehensive and up-to-date research on those effects virtually impossible,"" he explains.Recent reviews of lab data on RF-EMFs indicate that exposures can produce wide-ranging effects, including reproductive, fetal, oncological, neuropsychiatric, skin, eye and immunological.  But there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that it is implicated in the spread of COVID-19, as some conspiracy theorists have suggested, he emphasises.""There are knowledgeable commentators' reports on the web debunking this theory, and no respectable scientist or publication has backed it,"" he says, adding: ""the theory that 5G and related EMFs have contributed to the pandemic is baseless.""But for the current 5G roll-out, there's a sound basis for invoking 'the precautionary principle' because of significant doubts about the safety of a new and potentially widespread human exposure, which should be reason enough ""to call a moratorium on that exposure, pending adequate scientific investigation of its suspected adverse health effects,"" he says.  There is no compelling public health or safety rationale for the rapid deployment of 5G, he insists. The main gains being promised are either economic, and then possibly for some more than for others, or related to increased consumer convenience, he suggests. ""Until we know more about what we are getting into, from a health and ecological point of view, those putative gains need to wait,"" he concludes. ###Externally peer reviewed? Yes

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLCAn Apple Music logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Apple Music is rolling out a new hub specifically created to spotlight songwriters, producers, publishers and session musicians, which it is calling Behind The Songs. The new hub will be centered on two Apple Music playlist brands, Songbook and Behind The Boards, as well as editorial features and promotions and original content like its Lyrics To Live By and Song Stories video series.The hub, which is searchable in Apple Music, is broken out into radio shows -- like Deep Hidden Meaning Radio, hosted by the legendary Nile Rodgers -- as well as playlists that focus on individual producers and songwriters, artists who also write their own songs, and ones that focus on the work of session musicians, who are often unheralded and uncredited in their work. Apple also has a partnership with the U.K. songwriter/composer body The Ivors Academy, for which Behind The Songs will serve as the home.“Apple Music has, above all, continued to invest deeply in the songwriting community and its various components, and 'Behind the Songs' is a new place we can call home,"" Rodgers said in a statement about the announcement. ""I’ve loved bringing the stories of today’s most inspiring songwriters to life on my Deep Hidden Meaning radio show, and Apple Music been able to spotlight the best of what’s next with their resolute support of The Ivors Academy and the Rising Star Award.”As streaming has taken over as the dominant form of not only music listening and consumption, but also music discovery, songwriters have often been left behind in the discourse, as liner notes become less prevalent and digital metadata can be often incomplete. Lately, streaming services have taken steps to address those issues, introducing songwriter and producer credits and lyric-based search functionalities, as well as playlists that are specifically designed to shine a light on writers whose work is often obscured by the headline-making artists who sing and perform their work.In December, Spotify launched its own Songwriters Hub within its app and web player to serve a similar dynamic, which is centered on its Written By playlist series, which also features podcasts and other content from writers and producers. The service also introduced songwriter pages, giving writers their own place to share their work on the platform.A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry© 2021 Billboard Media, LLC.

365,Federal Court Agrees: Prosecutors Can’t Keep Forensic Evidence Secret from Defendants,Software,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/federal-court-agrees-prosecutors-cant-keep-forensic-evidence-secret-defendants,"When the government tries to convict you of a crime, you have a right to challenge its evidence. This is a fundamental principle of due process, yet prosecutors and technology vendors have routinely argued against disclosing how forensic technology works.For the first time, a federal court has ruled on the issue, and the decision marks a victory for civil liberties.EFF teamed up with the ACLU of Pennsylvania to file an amicus brief arguing in favor of defendants’ rights to challenge complex DNA analysis software that implicates them in crimes. The prosecution and the technology vendor Cybergenetics opposed disclosure of the software’s source code on the grounds that the company has a commercial interest in secrecy.The court correctly determined that this secrecy interest could not outweigh a defendant’s rights and ordered the code disclosed to the defense team. The disclosure will be subject to a “protective order” that bars further disclosure, but in a similar previous case a court eventually allowed public scrutiny of source code of a different DNA analysis program after a defense team found serious flaws.   This is the second decision this year ordering the disclosure of the secret TrueAllele software. This added scrutiny will help ensure that the software does not contribute to unjust incarceration.EFF has joined 42 other organizations, including the ACLU, the Knight Institute, and the National Security Archive calling for the new Biden administration to fulfill its promise to “bring transparency and truth back to government.” Specifically, these organizations are asking the administration and the federal government at large to...San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is representing four racial and immigrant justice groups— Just Futures Law, MediaJustice, Mijente Support Committee, and the Immigrant Defense Project—suing the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services under the Freedom of Information Act...Patents generate profits for private companies, but their power comes from the government, and in this country, the government’s power comes from the people.

366,Viva growth? What Microsoft’s launch means for this longtime player in employee experience tech,Business,https://www.geekwire.com/2021/viva-growth-microsofts-launch-means-longtime-player-employee-experience-tech/,"by Todd Bishop on February 26, 2021 at 8:27 amFebruary 26, 2021 at 9:24 amMicrosoft doesn’t bet big on small markets. With more than $150 billion in annual revenue and a market value that tops $1.7 trillion, the tech giant needs to see a major opportunity, with the potential for meaningful growth, to justify investing in a new product.“Microsoft is savvy about when the time is right for their business,” says Henry Albrecht, a longtime Seattle-area entrepreneur and tech executive. “They require massive global shifts, like the shift to cloud computing, the shift to the personal computer, and now, the shift to putting culture at the center of work. This is a seminal, once-every-decade shift in the employee-employer relationship.”That is Albrecht’s read on Microsoft Viva. The Redmond company’s new employee experience platform, unveiled Feb. 4, is part of a boom in technologies to help companies assess and improve the productivity, job satisfaction, engagement, and overall health and well-being of their employees. The rise of remote work during the pandemic has boosted interest in the market.Albrecht is in a good position to know. He has been betting on this market for 15 years as the CEO of Limeade, an employee experience technology company based up the road from Microsoft in Bellevue, Wash.He and his co-founders started Limeade in 2006, recognizing the value of employee well-being back when Microsoft was launching Windows Vista, and some guy named Satya Nadella was named to run the company’s business applications group.Limeade already integrates with Microsoft Teams, and Albrecht said he believes the Redmond company’s positioning of Viva as a platform “opens up immense possibilities” for other companies that want to leverage Microsoft’s reach.“For me, this is a tremendous validation of everything we’ve been working for, serving some of the biggest and best companies in the world for the last 15 years,” Albrecht said.Limeade financials: Limeade went public in December 2019 on the Australian stock market. The release this week of its annual financial results for 2020 provide a window into trends in the employee experience technology market.HR mindset shift: Speaking on the company’s earnings conference call, Albrecht said the pandemic initially had “a chilling effect” on purchasing by human resources departments, especially those that were dealing with layoffs and furloughs initially. However, he said, that’s changing now.“They’ve had a year to think about this, they’ve had a year to soak in how impactful this pandemic has been on things like addiction, social isolation, how do you manage a team remotely and get feedback, and just overall stress and burnout,” he said. “So we’re starting to see companies now say, we need to take this much more seriously in the future than we have before.”M&A: Asked about the outlook for mergers and acquisitions, Albrecht said on the earnings call that Workday’s $700 million acquisition of Peakon further illustrates the overall interest in employee experience technology. In addition to growing its own business organically, Albrecht said Limeade is “always looking for creative, strategic, selective inorganic growth through mergers and acquisitions.” The acquisition of Sitrion in 2018 added new capabilities to Limeade’s platform.Impact of the pandemic: The shift to remote work has “radically accelerated” the focus on employee experience technology, and the recognition of the importance of employee well-being, Albrecht said in an interview. He cited recent research from Limeade and others providing “clear evidence that work is broken, and employees are suffering.”Technology: Employee experience technologies vary widely by vendor, but generally include survey, communication, informational and educational tools.Market size: Microsoft cites analyst estimates putting the employee experience tech market at $300 billion in annual corporate spending. “In fact, I have never seen such a massive proliferation of technology hit the enterprise at once,” wrote industry analyst Josh Bersin in a white paper. “I am tracking more than 1,400 vendors that sell new tools for recruitment, performance management, wellbeing, learning, employee surveying, and other HR applications.”GeekWire members support independent journalism at a time when trusted storytelling and community engagement is more important than ever.

369,Canadian Liberal MP's private member’s bill seeks to give consumers 'right to repair' their smart devices,Hardware,https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/right-to-repair," Bryan May’s bill would update the Copyright Act to prohibit the use of so-called technological protection measures, or digital locks, to block repairs of devices A private member’s bill introduced this week in the House of Commons is the first step toward establishing a “right-to-repair” in Canada, the Liberal MP who tabled the bill says.A movement calling for consumers to be able to repair the devices they own has grown in recent years, because there’s an increasing number of items — from smartphones to farm equipment — that manufacturers are making it difficult or impossible for customers to fix on their own. The result is that customers are forced to pay those same manufacturers for repairs, or to replace the item.“The challenge is only going to get more and more significant. Right now we have things like smart TVs, and obviously cell phones, computer devices where this is a problem,” Bryan May, the MP who introduced the bill, said in a phone interview.“Everything that we own, everything from a toaster to our thermostat, is going to not be a ‘dumb device,’ but a smart device, and will all of a sudden, be covered under the Copyright Act.”If the car industry was covered by the same rules, there would be no aftermarket parts or independent mechanics, he noted. “I think that’s really what we’re looking at, is trying to get that same flexibility for the consumer, that they have with their car,” May said.May’s bill would update the Copyright Act to prohibit the use of so-called technological protection measures, or digital locks, to block repairs of devices. He gave the example of manufacturers who immobilize devices like tractors or games consoles to force owners to use licensed technicians.Allen Mendelsohn, a sessional lecturer at McGill University’s law faculty who specializes in internet and tech law, said the bill takes a “minimalist” approach, removing copyright liability for those who attempt to tinker with their devices or repair them. “It’s not a true right-to-repair,” he said.May agreed his bill doesn’t provide for a complete right-to-repair, but said it’s instead the federal piece that’s needed to enable the provinces, whose purview includes consumer protection, to put their own right-to-repair laws in place. If the federal Copyright Act isn’t changed, it’s difficult for provinces to require manufacturers to provide manuals and spare parts for devices, he said. In Ontario, a private member’s right-to-repair bill failed in 2019.May said one of the reasons he was motivated to introduce the bill is environmental, to help keep items out of landfills. He added that the pandemic has also resulted in “countless examples” of people not being able to repair their own medical devices while in lockdown.May introduced Bill C-272 in the House of Commons on Monday, and said he believes it will have the support of the other parties.But since the anti-circumvention legislation was put in place nearly a decade ago — making Canada the country with the most restrictive set of laws on digital locks anywhere in the world — the federal government has always had the regulatory power to address it, said Michael Geist, a law professor and Canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa.He said in an interview the right-to-repair has “repeatedly come up before committees and been raised by members of Parliament. And yet, successive industry and heritage ministers have done nothing.”Geist said it’s an issue that should be non-partisan, is relevant across the country, and “picks up on constituencies that aren’t usually interested as much in copyright. The agriculture community usually doesn’t usually think of copyright is one of their issues, but it is so long as they can’t fix their farm equipment. So, I would expect to see some real support for it.”Companies that often come up in discussions about the right-to-repair include farm and construction equipment manufacturer John Deere, whose equipment is now software-based. In some cases, farmers lose hours or days of work while their machine is immobilized and they must wait for an authorized technician.Another is Apple, which uses custom screws that require specialized screwdrivers to open its devices. Mendelsohn noted though it has begun to allow some authorized retailers to do repairs, Apple generally requires customers to go to its stores for repairs.Consumers pay over $1,000 for a new iPhone, Mendelsohn said. “They should be able to get that iPhone repaired, wherever they want, (and) not have to be beholden to Apple.”Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way.

370,India Targets Climate Activists With the Help of Big Tech,Politics,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/27/india-climate-activists-twitter-google-facebook/,"The Intercept is a First Look Media Company.Tech giants like Google and Facebook appear to be aiding and abetting a vicious government campaign against Indian climate activists.Climate activist Disha Ravi is granted bail during a hearing at Patiala House Court in New Delhi on Feb. 23, 2021.

Instead, the cameras were waiting for Disha Ravi, a nature-loving 22-year-old vegan climate activist who against all odds has found herself ensnared in an Orwellian legal saga that includes accusations of sedition, incitement, and involvement in an international conspiracy whose elements include (but are not limited to): Indian farmers in revolt, the global pop star Rihanna, supposed plots against yoga and chai, Sikh separatism, and Greta Thunberg.If you think that sounds far-fetched, well, so did the judge who released Ravi after nine days in jail under police interrogation. Judge Dharmender Rana was supposed to rule on whether Ravi, one of the founders of the Indian chapter of Fridays For Future, the youth climate group started by Thunberg, should continue to be denied bail. He ruled that there was no reason for bail to be denied, which cleared the way for Ravi’s return to her home in Bengaluru (also known as Bangalore) that night.But the judge also felt the need to go much further, to issue a scathing 18-page ruling on the underlying case that has gripped Indian media for weeks, issuing his own personal verdict on the various explanations provided by the Delhi police for why Ravi had been apprehended in the first place. The police’s evidence against the young climate activist is, he wrote, “scanty and sketchy,” and there is not “even an iota” of proof to support the claims of sedition, incitement, or conspiracy that have been leveled against her and at least two other young activists.Though the international conspiracy case appears to be falling apart, Ravi’s arrest has spotlighted a different kind of collusion, this one between the increasingly oppressive and anti-democratic Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Silicon Valley companies whose tools and platforms have become the primary means for government forces to incite hatred against vulnerable minorities and critics — and for police to ensnare peaceful activists like Ravi in a high-tech digital web.The case against Ravi and her “co-conspirators” hinges entirely on routine uses of well-known digital tools: WhatsApp groups, a collectively edited Google Doc, a private Zoom meeting, and several high-profile tweets, all of which have been weaponized into key pieces of alleged evidence in a state-sponsored and media-amplified activist hunt. At the same time, these very tools have been used in a coordinated pro-government messaging campaign to turn public sentiment against the young activists and the movement of farmers they came together to support, often in clear violation of the guardrails social media companies claim to have erected to prevent violent incitement on their platforms.In a nation where online hatred has tipped with chilling frequency into real-world pogroms targeting women and minorities, human rights advocates are warning that India is on the knife edge of terrible violence, perhaps even the kind of genocidal bloodshed that social media aided and abetted against the Rohingya in Myanmar.Through it all, the giants of Silicon Valley have stayed conspicuously silent, their famed devotion to free expression, as well as their newfound commitment to battling hate speech and conspiracy theories, is, in India, nowhere to be found. In its place is a growing and chilling complicity with Modi’s information war, a collaboration that is poised to be locked in under a draconian new digital media law that will make it illegal for tech companies to refuse to cooperate with government requests to take down offending material or to breach the privacy of tech users. Complicity in human rights abuses, it seems, is the price of retaining access to the largest market of digital media users outside China.After some early resistance from the company, Twitter accounts critical of the Modi government have disappeared in the hundreds without explanation; government officials engaging in bald incitement and overt hate speech on Twitter and Facebook have been permitted to continue in clear violation of the companies’ policies; and Delhi police boast that they are getting plenty of helpful cooperation from Google as they dig through the private communications of peaceful climate activists like Ravi.“The silence of these companies speaks volumes,” a digital rights activist told me, requesting anonymity out of fear of retribution. “They have to take a stand, and they have to do it now.”Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, left, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, right, hug at the conclusion of a town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sept. 27, 2015.

When Ravi was arrested, the Delhi police declared that she “is an Editor of the Toolkit Google Doc & key conspirator in document’s formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc.”The kit was nothing more than a Google Doc put together by an ad hoc collection of activists in India and the diaspora designed to generate support for the movement of farmers that has been staging enormous and relentless protests for months.The farmers oppose a set of new agricultural laws that Modi’s government rushed through under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic. At the heart of the protests is the belief that by doing away with longtime price protections for crops and opening up the agricultural sector to more private investment, small farmers will face a “death warrant,” and India’s fertile lands will fall into the hands of a few large corporate players.Many nonfarmers have looked for ways to help, both in India and in the global South Asian diaspora, as well as more broadly. The youth-led climate movement felt a particular responsibility to step up. As Ravi said in court, she supports the farmers “because they are our future, and we all need to eat.” And she has also pointed to a climate connection. Drought, heat waves, and flooding have all grown more intense in recent years, and India’s farmers are on the front lines of these climate impacts, often losing their crops and livelihoods, experiences Ravi knows about firsthand from witnessing her farmer grandparents struggle with weather extremes.Much like countless such documents of the digital organizing age, the toolkit at the center of this controversy contains a buffet of familiar suggestions for how people can express their solidarity with India’s farmers, mainly on social media. “Tweet your support to the Indian Farmers. Use hashtag #FarmersProtest #StandWithFarmers”; take a picture or a video of yourself saying you support the farmers; sign a petition; write to your representative; participate in a “tweetstorm” or “digital strike”; attend one of the protests in person, whether inside India or at an Indian embassy in your country; learn more by attending a Zoom information session. An early version of the document (soon deleted) talked about challenging India’s peace-and-love, or “yoga & chai,” public image.Pretty much every major activist campaign generates clicktivist how-to guides exactly like this one. Most mid-sized nongovernmental organizations have someone whose job it is to draft such documents and send them to potential supporters and “influencers.” If they are illegal, then contemporary activism itself is illegal. By arresting and imprisoning Ravi for an alleged role as an editor of the toolkit, she is in essence being criminalized for making India look bad in front of the world. Under that definition, all international human rights work would need to be shut down, since that work rarely presents governments in a flattering light.This point was made forcefully by the judge who ruled on Ravi’s bail: “Citizens are conscience keepers of government in any democratic Nation. They cannot be put behind the bars simply because they choose to disagree with the state policies,” he wrote. As for sharing the toolkit with Thunberg, “the freedom of speech and expression includes the right to seek a global audience.”This seems obvious. Yet somehow this most benign of documents has been latched onto by multiple government officials as something far more nefarious. General VK Singh, Modi’s minister of state for road transport and highways, wrote in a Facebook post that the toolkit “revealed the real designs of a conspiracy at an international level against India. Need to investigate the parties which are pulling the strings of this evil machinery. Instructions were laid out clearly as to the ‘how’, ‘when’ and ‘what’. Conspiracies at this scale often get exposed.”The Delhi police quickly took its cue and set out to find evidence of this international conspiracy to “defame the country” and undermine the government, using a draconian colonial-era sedition law. But it didn’t stop there. The toolkit also stands accused of being part of a secret plot to break India apart and form a Sikh state called Khalistan (more sedition), because a Vancouver-based Indo-Canadian who helped put it together has expressed some sympathy for the idea of an independent Sikh homeland (not a crime and nowhere mentioned in the toolkit). And remarkably, for one Google Doc that the police claim was mainly written in Canada, this same toolkit stands accused of inciting and possibly plotting violence at a large farmers’ “tractor rally” in Delhi on January 26.Thousands of Indian farmers on tractors entered New Delhi as the country marked its Republic Day on Jan. 26, 2021, escalating protests against new agricultural laws passed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.
Photo: Anindito Mukherjee/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesFor weeks, these claims have gone viral online, much of it under coordinated hashtag campaigns spearheaded by India’s Ministry of External Affairs and faithfully echoed by top Bollywood and cricket stars. Anil Vij, a government minister in the state of Haryana, tweeted in Hindi that “Whoever has seeds of anti-nationalism in their mind has to be destroyed from the roots, be it #Disha_Ravi or anyone else.” Challenged as an obvious example of hate speech by a powerful figure, Twitter claimed that the post did not violate its policies and left it up.Indian print and broadcast media has relentlessly echoed the preposterous charges of sedition, with well over 100 stories about Ravi and the toolkit appearing in the Times of India alone. Television news shows have run crime-stopper-style exposés of the international toolkit “conspiracy.” Not surprisingly, the rage has spilled out into the streets, with photos of Thunberg and Rihanna (who also tweeted in support of the farmers) burned at nationalist rallies.Modi himself has even weighed in, speaking of enemies who have “stooped so low that they are not sparing even Indian tea” — widely taken as a reference to the deleted “yoga & chai” line.And then, earlier this week, the whole frothy mess seem to fall flat. Rana, in his order releasing Ravi, wrote that “perusal of the said ‘Toolkit’ reveals that any call for any kind of violence is conspicuously absent.” The claim that the kit was a secessionist plot was also entirely unproven, he wrote, an elaborate guilt-by-association inference.As for the charge that disseminating critical information about India’s treatment of farmers and human rights defenders to prominent activists like Thunberg constitutes “sedition,” the judge was particularly harsh. “The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments.”The case is ongoing, but the ruling represents a major blow to the government and a vindication for the farmer’s movement and the solidarity campaigns supporting them. However, it is hardly a victory. Even if the toolkit case loses steam as a result of the judge’s slap-down, it is just one of hundreds of campaigns that the Indian government is waging to hunt down activists, organizers, and journalists. Labor organizer Nodeep Kaur, one year older than Ravi, was also jailed for her support of the farmers. Just released on bail, Kaur claimed in court that she had been badly beaten while in police custody. Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers remain behind bars and some of those arrested have disappeared.The real threat that the toolkit represented to Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, was always, at root, about the power of the farmers’ movement. Modi’s political project represents a powerful merger of unleashed Hindu chauvinism with highly concentrated corporate power. The farmers challenge that dual project, both in their insistence that food should stay outside market logics and in the movement’s proven ability to build power across the religious, ethnic, and geographic divisions that are the lifeblood of Modi’s rise to power.Ravinder Kaur, a professor at the University of Copenhagen and the author of “Brand New Nation: Capitalist Dreams and Nationalist Designs in Twenty-First-Century India,” writes that the farmers are “perhaps the largest mass mobilisation in post-colonial India’s history, one that spans rural and urban populations, and conjoins the revolt against deregulated capitalism to the struggle for civil liberties.” For Modi’s powerful merger of transnational capital with a hypernationalistic state, “the anti-farm law mobilisation poses the most sustained and direct challenge to this alliance yet.”Protests by farmers in and around Delhi have been met with water cannons, tear gas, and mass arrests. But they keep coming, too big to defeat with force alone. That is why the Modi government has been so determined to find ways to undermine the movement and suppress its message, repeatedly blocking the internet ahead of protests and successfully pressuring Twitter to cancel over a thousand pro-farmer accounts. It is also why Modi has sought to muddy the waters with tales of devious toolkits and international conspiracies.An open letter signed by dozens of Indian environmental activists after Ravi’s arrest made this point: “[T]he current actions of the Central Government are diversionary tactics to distract people from real issues like the ever-rising cost of fuel and essential items, the widespread unemployment and distress caused due to the lockdown without a plan, and the alarming state of the environment.”It is this quest for a political diversion, in other words, that helps explain how a simple solidarity campaign has been recast as a secret plot to break India apart and incite violence from abroad. The Modi government is attempting to drag the public debate away from terrain where it is glaringly weak — meeting people’s basic needs during an economic crisis and pandemic — and move it to the ground on which every ethnonationalist project thrives: us versus them, insiders versus outsiders, patriots versus seditious traitors.In this familiar maneuver, Ravi and the broader youth climate movement were simply collateral damage.Yet the damage done is considerable, and not only because the interrogations are ongoing and Ravi’s return to jail remains distinctly possible. As the joint letter from Indian environmental advocates states, her arrest and imprisonment have already served a purpose: “The Government’s heavy-handedness are clearly focused on terrorising and traumatising these brave young people for speaking truth to power, and amounts to teaching them a lesson.”The still wider damage is in the chill the entire toolkit controversy has placed over political dissent in India — with the silent complicity of the tech companies that once touted their powers to open up closed societies and spread democracy around the world. As one headline put it, “Disha Ravi arrest puts privacy of all Google India users in doubt.”Indeed, public debate has been so deeply compromised that many activists in India are going underground, deleting their own social media accounts to protect themselves. Even digital rights advocates are wary of being quoted on the record. Asking not to be named, a legal researcher described a dangerous convergence between a government adept at information war and social media companies built on maximizing engagement to mine their users’ data: “All of this stems from a stronger weaponization of social media platforms by the status quo, something that was not present earlier. This is further aggravated by the tendency of these companies to prioritise more viral, extremist content, which allows them to monetise user attention, ultimately benefitting their profit motives.”Since her arrest, the entrails of Ravi’s private digital life have been laid out for all to see, picked over by a voracious and salacious national media. Televised panels and newspapers obsessed over her private text messages to Thunberg as well as other communications among activists who were doing nothing but editing an online pamphlet. Police, meanwhile, have repeatedly insisted that Ravi’s decision to delete a WhatsApp group was proof that she had committed a crime, rather than a rational response to government attempts to turn peaceful digital organizing into a weapon directed at young activists.Ravi’s lawyers have asked the court to order the police to stop leaking her private communications to the press — information they seemingly have as result of seized phones and computers. Wanting still more private information for their investigation, the Delhi police have also made demands of several major tech companies. They have asked Zoom to disclose the list of attendees of a private activist meeting which they say relates to the toolkit; police have made several requests to Google for information about how the toolkit was posted and shared. And according to news reports, police have asked Instagram (owned by Facebook) and Twitter for toolkit-related information as well. It is unclear which companies have complied and to what extent. The police have touted Google’s cooperation publicly, but Google and Facebook did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment. Zoom and Twitter referred to their corporate policies, which state that they will comply with relevant national laws.Which may be why the Modi government has chosen this moment to introduce a new set of regulations that would give it levels of control over digital media so draconian they come close to China’s great firewall. On February 24, the day after Ravi’s release from jail, Reuters reported on the Modi government’s planned “Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code.” The new rules will require media companies to take down content that affects “the sovereignty and integrity of India” within 36 hours of a government order — a definition so broad that it could easily include slights against yoga and chai. The new code also states that digital media companies must cooperate with government and police requests for information about their users within 72 hours. That includes requests to trace down the originating source of “mischievous information” on platforms and perhaps even encrypted messaging apps.The new code is being introduced in the name of protecting India’s diverse society and blocking vulgar content. “A publisher shall take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context and exercise due caution and discretion when featuring the activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious group,” the draft rules state.In practice, however, the BJP has one of the most sophisticated troll armies on the planet, and its own politicians have been the most vociferous and aggressive promotors of hate speech directed at vulnerable minorities and critics of all kinds. To cite just one example of many, several BJP politicians actively participated in a misinformation campaign claiming that Muslims were deliberately spreading Covid-19 as part of a “Corona Jihad.” What a code like this would do is enshrine in law the double digital vulnerability experienced by Ravi and other activists: They would be unprotected from online mobs revved up by a Hindu nationalist state, and they would be unprotected from that same state when it sought to invade their digital privacy for any reason it chose.Apar Gupta, executive director of the digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation, expressed particular concern about parts of the new code that may allow government officials to track down the originators of messages on platforms like WhatsApp. This, he told the Associated Press, “undermines user rights and can lead to self-censorship if users fear that their conversations are no longer private.”Harsha Walia, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and author of “Border and Rule: Global Migration, Capitalism, and the Rise of Racist Nationalism,” puts the dire situation in India like this: “The latest proposed regulations requiring social media companies to assist Indian law enforcement is yet another outrageous and undemocratic attempt by the fascist Hindutva Modi government to suppress dissent, solidify the surveillance state, and escalate state violence.” She told me that this latest move by the Modi government needs to be understood as part of much broader pattern of sophisticated information warfare waged by the Indian state. “Three weeks ago, the Indian government shut down the internet in parts of Delhi to suppress information about the farmers protest; social media accounts of journalists and activists at the farmers protest and in the Sikh diaspora were suspended; and Big Tech cooperated with Indian police in a number of baseless but chilling sedition cases. In the past four years, the Indian government has ordered over 400 internet shutdowns, and the Indian occupation of Kashmir is marked by a prolonged communications siege.”The new code, which will impact all digital media, including streaming and news sites, is set to take effect within the next three months. A few digital media producers in India are pushing back. Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, tweeted last Thursday that the “lethal” new code is “aimed at killing the independence of India’s digital news media. This attempt to arm bureaucrats with the power to tell the media what can and can’t be published has no basis in law.”Do not expect portraits of courage from Silicon Valley, however. Many U.S. tech executives regret early decisions, made under public and worker pressure, to refuse to cooperate with China’s apparatus of mass surveillance and censorship — an ethical choice, but one that cost companies like Google access to a staggeringly large, lucrative market. These companies appear unwilling to make the same kind of calculation again. As the Wall Street Journal reported last August, “India has more Facebook and WhatsApp users than any other country, and Facebook has chosen it as the market in which to introduce payments, encryption and initiatives to tie its products together in new ways that [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg has said will occupy Facebook for the next decade.”For tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Zoom, India under Modi has turned into a harsh moment of truth. In North America and Europe, these companies are going to great lengths to show that they can be trusted to regulate hate speech and harmful conspiracies on their platforms while protecting the freedom to speak, debate, and disagree that is integral to any healthy society. But in India, where helping governments hunt and imprison peaceful activists and amplify hate appears to be the price of access to a huge and growing market, “all of those arguments have gone out the window,” one activist told me.

A year earlier, Airbnb lost $352 million.Revenue fell 22% to $859 million in the quarter that ended Dec. 31. That was still more than analysts expected, according to a FactSet survey, and a far smaller percentage decline than reported by rivals Expedia, Tripadvisor and Bookings Holdings.Airbnb declined to offer a forecast for 2021 profit and revenue. Company executives said they are upbeat about a recovery, but they said the unknown pace of vaccinations make it difficult to know how quickly people will be willing to travel. The company did say revenue will not decline as much in the current quarter as it did in the fourth quarter of last year.In late January, Airbnb said a survey it commissioned showed that just over half of Americans have already booked a trip or plan to travel this year.Since the start of the pandemic, Airbnb has shifted its focus to beach towns and mountain destinations — outdoorsy places where the risk of contracting the coronavirus is perceived to be lower. The company expects rentals in big cities to come back last.It has also slashed costs and jobs to ride out the pandemic, much like airlines and others in the travel industry.CEO Brian Chesky said his company will benefit from changes in travel and jobs as many people work from somewhere other than the office — maybe a rental far from home.“When travel comes back, we believe it will look different than before,” Chesky said on a call with analysts. “People are living more nomadically. Some people are taking longer-term stays, one or two months at a time in Airbnb.”The company is counting on adding hosts. It believes that people who book long-term rentals will also turn to Airbnb to rent their empty homes.For all of 2020, Airbnb lost nearly $4.6 billion including the charge for stock-based compensation and a separate charge of $827 million for stock warrants tied to a loan. That compared with a 2019 loss of $674 million. Even as revenue increased, the company also lost money in 2017 and 2018 as it spent heavily on marketing and technology and added new lines to the business.Despite the years of losses, Airbnb generated sky-high expectations from investors, which led to         a winning debut on the stock market in December, when its shares more than doubled the San Francisco-based company’s target price and gave it a valuation of just over $100 billion. At $3.7 billion, it was the biggest U.S. IPO in 2020, according to Renaissance Capital.Airbnb faces challenges, including opposition from hotels. Some cities have stepped up restrictions on short-term rentals. Critics say Airbnb contributes to higher rents and home prices in some markets. Some of the company’s hosts aren’t just sharing their homes, they are turning them into businesses catering to tourists, reducing the supply of housing for local residents, according to some researchers.Before the release of financial results, the company's shares fell 9.1% to close at $182.06. They rose less than 1% in after-hours trading.———David Koenig can be reached at twitter.com/airlinewriter24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

374,Facebook doesn't seem to mind that facial recognition glasses would endanger women: Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into its smart glasses – which would make life easy for stalkers,Privacy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/27/facebook-facial-recognition-glasses-would-endanger-women,"Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into its smart glasses – which would make life easy for stalkersLast modified on Sat 27 Feb 2021 14.02 GMTPicture this: you’re sitting in a bar and a creepy stranger keeps trying to talk to you. You ignore them. The next day you get a text from that stranger. Not only do they know your phone number, they know where you live; in fact, they know everything about you. They were wearing Facebook smart glasses, you see. The moment they looked in your direction the glasses identified you via facial recognition technology.This, it seems, is precisely the sort of Black Mirror-esque future Facebook wants. The tech company (and serial privacy invader) has teamed up with Ray-Ban to develop a range of smart glasses. While it’s not clear exactly what these devices will do yet, Buzzfeed has reported that Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into them. During an internal meeting on Thursday, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice-president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that Facebook was currently assessing the legal issues surrounding this.Legal issues are one thing, but what about the very obvious ethical and privacy issues? Would you be able to mark your face as “unsearchable?”, one employee asked. And what about the potential for “real-world harm” and “stalkers”?Bosworth replied: “Face recognition … might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things.”Excuse me? What kind of benefits could possibly balance the risk of making life extremely easy for stalkers and creeps? Well, Bosworth later said on Twitter, it could help people with prosopagnosia, a neurological condition where you can’t recognize people’s faces. More generally, Bosworth said, it would be super handy when you run into someone at a party and can’t remember their name. Ah yes, I can totally see how avoiding a little social awkwardness balances out the whole stalker thing!No need to worry too much about privacy, though. We all know you can trust Facebook to do the right thing and keep your data nice and safe. When a (female) Wired editor raised the concern that you could no longer pacify creeps at parties by giving them a fake name and number, for example, Bosworth breezily replied that there’d be a technological fix for that. The exchange makes it almost hilariously clear that Bosworth had given very little thought to the implications of this kind of tech on women’s everyday lives. Which is to be expected, considering Facebook started life as a website that let people rank hot girls via photos obtained without their consent.Facebook, of course, may not end up building facial recognition into its glasses. However, the fact it is even considering doing so is a disturbing reminder of how little ownership we currently have over our own faces. Several photos of your face, for example, are probably in Clearview AI’s database. The company, which counts the Facebook board member Peter Thiel as an investor, built a secretive facial recognition tool which it trained, in part, on pictures it scraped from social media. It sells its services to law enforcement agencies but also gives access to its app – which lets you hold your phone up to someone’s face and pull up their personal information – to select people. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of Gristedes grocery, boasted about using the Clearview App to identify a man he saw on a date with his daughter, for example.As well as being intrusive, facial recognition technology is plagued with problems. It doesn’t work as well on people with darker skin, for one thing. At least three black men have been falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. But as long as the collateral damage involved with this tech is just black people and women, who cares, eh? None of the big technology companies seem to. Timnit Gebru is one of the leading voices in AI ethics and has done groundbreaking work around bias in facial recognition technology. Gebru was fired from her role as technical co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team in December; she alleges they were trying to suppress her research on bias. Last week Google also fired Margaret Mitchell, another top AI ethics researcher. Big tech loves to wax lyrical about their commitment to privacy and ethics but their actions tell a very different story.It’s illegal for married couples to have different surnames in Japan. Couples don’t have to use the man’s last name but do so 96% of the time. There has been pressure to change this ridiculous law and let women keep their birth names after marriage but conservatives reckon this would damage the traditional family unit. I mean, think of the children! Having parents with different names would be an unspeakable trauma! Japan’s minister for women’s empowerment and gender seems to think so, anyway: she was one of 50 politicians who recently opposed a legal change to shared surnames.“The transition to a postnatal body, with all of its curious and sometimes distressing frailties, is just as much an inextricable part of motherhood as it is an invisible one,” writes Elicia O’Reilly.

                            Semiconductors and the U...                        
Semiconductors, otherwise known as “chips,” are an ­­essential component at the heart of economic growth, security, and technological innovation. Smaller than the size of a postage stamp, thinner than a human hair, and made of nearly 40 billion components, the impact that semiconductors are having on world development exceeds that of the Industrial Revolution. From smartphones, PCs, pacemakers to the internet, electronic vehicles, aircrafts, and hypersonic weaponry, semiconductors are ubiquitous in electrical devices and the digitization of goods and services such as global e-commerce. And demand is skyrocketing, with the industry facing numerous challenges and opportunities as emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced wireless communications, notably 5G, all requiring cutting-edge semiconductor-enabled devices. But the COVID-19 pandemic and international trade disputes are straining the industry’s supply and value chains while the battle between the United States and China over tech supremacy risks splintering the supply chain further, contributing to technological fragmentation and significant disruption in international commerce.For decades, the U.S. has been a leader in the semiconductor industry, controlling 48 percent (or $193 billion) of the market share in terms of revenue as of 2020. According to IC Insights, eight of the 15 largest semiconductor firms in the world are in the U.S., with Intel ranking first in terms of sales. China is a net importer of semiconductors, heavily relying on foreign manufacturers—notably those in the U.S.—to enable most of its technology. China imported $350 billion worth of chips in 2020, an increase of 14.6 percent from 2019. Through its Made in China 2025 initiative and Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development, over the past six years, China has been ramping up its efforts using financial incentives, intellectual property (IP) and antitrust standards to accelerate the development of its domestic semiconductor industry, diminish its reliance on the U.S., and establish itself as a global tech leader. As U.S.-China competition has intensified, notably under the former Trump administration, the U.S. has been tightening semiconductor export controls with stricter licensing policies, particularly toward Chinese entities. Concerns continue regarding China’s acquisition of American technology through civilian supply chains and integration with Chinese military and surveillance capabilities.Caught between these global superpowers is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), a leading manufacturer in the industry, owning 51.5 percent of the foundry market and producing the most advanced chips in the world (10 nanometers or smaller). TSMC supports both American and Chinese firms such as Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Xilinx. Until recently, the firm also supplied Huawei but severed ties with the Chinese giant in May 2020 because of U.S. Department of Commerce restrictions on Huawei suppliers over security concerns.Taiwan has also become a geopolitical focal point because the Trump administration’s moves to strengthen American-Taiwanese relations heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait and increased China’s military activity in the region, testing the Biden administration’s resolve. Together, these factors present significant risks to a critical manufacturing node for the global semiconductor industry. Taiwan represents one part of the industry’s complex ecosystem and shows more broadly the increasing difficulty for companies and countries to remain insulated from geopolitics—particularly amid pressures contributing to U.S. and China decoupling. As geopolitical, trade, and technology disputes mount and the COVID-19 pandemic continues to harm the supply and value chains, semiconductor firms are trying to secure their manufacturing processes by stockpiling supplies or relocating production facilities—disrupting the industry at large.With semiconductors at the heart of U.S.-China strategic and technological competition, the industry continues to experience a range of protective tariff and non-tariff measures that threaten production and competitiveness of the industry. This FP Insider Report analyzes the evolving strategic economic relationship among China, Taiwan, and the United States as it pertains to semiconductors, examines the growing economic and security challenges that key private and public sector actors within the industry face, and pinpoints opportunities for the Biden administration as it seeks to bolster U.S. competitiveness while containing China’s technological ambitions. In particular, this report finds:Broadly speaking, semiconductors, also known as integrated circuits (ICs), computer chips, microchips, or chips are the building blocks of technology. A semiconductor is a crystal material that possesses features of both insulators (materials that do not conduct electricity) and conductors (materials that do). Semiconductor devices such as transistors, which perform an essential function of controlling electrical current flow, are often connected or “printed” onto circuit boards, a hardware component of an electrical product that provides structural support to hold all other components in place and provides necessary wiring to connect signals and power to these components. Each device performs specific functions across various microprocessor chips such as central processing units (CPUs), memory chips, sensor chips, graphics processing units (GPUs), and power management. Semiconductor devices can also allow communication among devices like mobile phones, gaming systems, aircraft, industrial machinery, and military equipment and weaponry.While demand for semiconductors has been surging, the cyclical nature of the industry contributes to market volatility and unpredictable returns. Profits depend on types of chips produced, consumer preferences, and shortening product lifecycles and demand for newer, faster applications that make tech quickly obsolete. As each new generation of semiconductors becomes smaller and more densely packed with transistors, the complexity and cost of production increases, giving each segment of the supply chain a chance to enhance product competitiveness and quality. Because of this, only a few companies can design and manufacture advanced chips while also being flexible enough to make continual technological improvements. From equipment production to chip manufacturing, companies with products and services that are marginally better than their competitors are able to capture an outsized portion of industry revenue (on average half).The three main segments of the production process include: design, manufacturing, and assembly, testing & packaging (ATP)—with various design and fabrication facilities, or “fabs” contributing to the supply chain. The largest semiconductor manufacturers are in the U.S., South Korea, Europe, and Japan, but only a handful are vertically integrated; these Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) include companies such as Intel, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron Technologies. Much of the industry, however, employs a “fabless-foundry model,” which delineates tasks to specialized companies, and relies on outsourcing parts of the value chain— notably to firms in Taiwan, China, and Singapore —to mitigate production costs and leverage local expertise to improve product performance. The “fabless” firms have no manufacturing capabilities and specifically design chips, while foundries focus on manufacturing, and outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing companies (OSATs) support testing and assembling semiconductor components into workable devices. Ninety percent of the value of a chip is split evenly between the design and fabrication stages, and 10 percent is added during the ATP stage. The graphic below details the general production process for semiconductors starting with raw material sourcing, which is critical to enhancing the industry’s rate of technological innovation, through distribution for use in electronic goods.The semiconductor manufacturing process is completed in six primary steps: raw material sourcing, research & development (R&D), designing, manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP), and distribution. Various levels of specialization and functional delineation across the supply chain have resulted in two production models in the industry: Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) and fabless-foundry.Semiconductors are usually composed of silicon or gallium arsenide. Each material has advantages depending on the functionality of the semiconductor, differing on cost-to-performance ratios, high-speed operations, high-temperature tolerances, or desired response to a signal.Notable semiconductor R&D companies include:After sourcing the necessary raw materials and research comes design, manufacturing, and assembly, testing and packaging (ATP). The raw material sourcing, R&D, and distribution segments are not strictly part of the production process but are included in this analysis because of the essential role they play in the value chain.At each stage of the production life cycle, specialized companies split production across designing, manufacturing, and ATP. Companies that concentrate on design are known as “fabless” firms because they have no fabrication capabilities, foundry companies offer contract manufacturing services for these fabless firms, and Outsourced Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies perform ATP services. The fabless-foundry model benefits from task specialization and allows companies to concentrate and invest on a singular part of the manufacturing process.Also known as “fabless” because they have no fabrication capabilities themselves, design firms lack their own manufacturing capabilities and outsource the manufacturing and ATP segments of the production process to third parties. Top ranking fabless firms in 2020 by revenue include: Foundries manufacture semiconductors based on designs by fabless firms. This segment of the supply chain often has high fixed costs and manufacturers must constantly improve facilities to keep up with rapid tech innovation. Top ranking foundries in 2020 by revenue include: Top ranking Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing (OSAT) firms in 2019 by revenue include:Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) vertically integrate the entire production processes. Depending on the type of chip, one company will execute the production segments—designing, manufacturing, and ATP—on their own. For instance, Samsung, and SK Hynix are IDM businesses that produce their own advanced memory chips, namely DRAMs and NAND flash chips. However, they lack such capabilities in non-memory chips and may outsource the production of non-memory chips to other companies. Notable IDMs in the semiconductor industry include:Semiconductors are shipped to distributors and equipment manufacturers for use in electronic goods. Electronics manufacturing services (EMS) distribute electronic test components and printed circuit boards (PCB) assemblies and provide return/repair services for these electronic components and assemblies for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Semiconductors can also be distributed directly to the OEMs.Notable EMS and ODM market leaders in 2019 include:Over the past few decades, the trend has been toward the fabless-foundry model to mitigate production costs and leverage specialist knowledge throughout the value chain. Capital-intensive portions of the supply chain, such as design and manufacturing, which require highly specialized knowledge and advanced production equipment at a capacity utilization rate of 90 percent, typically occur in Canada, Europe, or the U.S. ATP, or the back-end production where components are tested before being assembled and packaged into finish products such as laptops, is the most labor-intensive segment of the supply chain and often occurs in countries where wages and taxes are comparatively low, such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. As a result, the semiconductor industry today is highly globalized with a typical production process spanning four countries and 25,000 miles. The map below walks through the semiconductor production process in detail. It highlights the globalized nature of the industry and the various countries and private sector actors involved.This map was adapted from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)’s Beyond Borders report (2016) to include critical private sector actors and countries involved in the supply chain from raw material sourcing to sales and distribution of the product. It portrays the complex semiconductor industry ecosystem and emphasizes the necessity to secure each segment individually according to its unique characteristics in order to fortify the supply and value chains.

		Silicon (Si) is a light chemical element that combines with oxygen and other elements to form silicates. Small quantities of silicon are processed into high-purity silicon for the semiconductor industry. The graphic below shows the global estimated production of silicon materials in 2020. Consensus is growing that the industry is reaching the end of Moore's Law where companies are reaching the utmost capacity to squeeze transistors onto a given length of silicon. As a result, semiconductor firms and the tech industry at large are looking to gallium nitride (GaN) to replace silicon and cut energy use worldwide. GaN is more efficient than Si for its ""band gap,"" which allows for better electrical conductivity and higher temperature tolerance. Experts estimate that GaN can cut power use by 10 to 25 percent.Source: United States Geological Survey (USGS)In thousand metric tonsIn thousand metric tonsNotes: Production quantities are the silicon content for combined totals for ferrosilicon and silicon metal, except as noted. * indicates silicon content for ferrosilicon onlySource: United States Geological Survey (USGS)In kilogramsNote: No domestic primary (low-grade, unrefined) gallium has been recovered since 1987 in the United States.

		In this step, silicon blocks (ingots) are cut into wafers using either steel wire or diamond-coated wire. The silicon wafer cutting equipment market is segmented into the United States, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and other countries. According to the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), Japan is a leader in the silicon wafer cutting industry and is considered to be the foremost supplier of materials, including wafer fabrication and packaging (e.g., lead frames and bonding wires).Access to advanced semiconductor equipment manufacturers (SME) is a critical supply chain bottleneck, particularly for China, whose access has largely been blocked by countries that are key U.S. allies. For instance, ASML, a Dutch-based company, is dominant in the semiconductor lithography market and is the only company that manufactures high-tech EUVs, which are essential to make cutting-edge chips (5nm or smaller). The SME market is projected to reach $119 billion by 2026 (up from $64.55 billion in 2018) with a CAGR of 8 percent as demand for emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, automated driving, and artificial intelligence (AI) drive market growth.

		Otherwise known as the ""back-end"" production, chips are assembled, tested, and packaged, ready for shipment. Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing (OSAT) firms are third-party vendors that provide these services. Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) such as Intel and Samsung also outsource some of their in-house packaging production to OSATs.This stage is the most labor-intensive and requires fewer technical skills, thus is often performed where wages are comparatively low. Most of the world’s leading providers of ATP are based in Taiwan, the United States, China, and Singapore, but have many factories abroad, including Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Portugal, China, and more. For instance, Texas Instruments (U.S.-based) has ATP plants in the Philippines and Intel (U.S.-based) has ATP plants in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam. According to researchers, Taiwanese-based firms account for 54 percent of total outsourced ATP revenues, followed by the United States (17 percent), China (12 percent), Singapore (12 percent), and Japan (5 percent).Sources: TrendForce and Market Research ReportsIn billions of U.S. dollarsSource: Market Research ReportsSources: Source Today, TrendforceSource: ScienceDirect

		Finished products are shipped to distributors or directly sold to equipment manufacturers. Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) tests, manufactures, distributes, and provides return/repair services for electronic components for the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design and manufacture chips and can sell their products to other companies. High volumes and increased frequency of orders have shortened fulfillment timelines. Logistics, both inbound and outbound, are playing an increasingly important role for product launches and customer visibility into the supply chain.The Asia Pacific region accounts for 36.5 percent of the market share for distribution with Taiwan and China as the key players. Seventy-five percent of the global EMS market is held by Taiwanese companies. North America holds the second highest market share at 35.3 percent. Foxconn is the leading EMS provider in the world, accounting for more than 50 percent of revenue.Singapore is a major connectivity hub in the Asia Pacific region with top semiconductor firms and R&D companies expanding their operations in the country. Fourteen wafer fabrication plans, including leading firms such as Micron, NXP, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), GlobalFoundries, and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) have fabs and distribution centers in Singapore.

Data reflects forecasts by IC Insights as of November 2020. Infineon’s total sales includes its acquired company’s sales in 2020. Apple is an anomaly in this ranking because it designs and uses its processors and other custom ICs only in its own products. None of the company’s chip devices are sold to other system makers.COVID-19’s disruptions on supply chains has been a wake-up call for the industry, forcing companies to evaluate and map out their value chain models, with many recognizing that they are unaware of all the tiers of suppliers that they rely on. Operational segments of the supply chain that are more labor intensive, such as the manufacturing and ATP stages have been particularly affected by social distancing, travel restrictions, and lockdown measures. Concurrent and heightened demand for private IT infrastructure (for example, PCs, servers, wireless and wired communications for home schooling and working from home, and automobiles for independent travel), has increased total industry revenue by 8 percent in the past year but pinched these already tenuous chains. With emerging technology developers driving demand, especially artificial intelligence applications, which are expected to grow 50 percent by 2022, manufacturers and end-users across sectors are scrambling to secure access to chips.While American firms dominate many segments of the semiconductor supply chain, they have long specialized in research & development (R&D), which is essential to drive continued innovation. Because of arduous market conditions including intense competition and rapid technological changes that require continual development, R&D and greater innovation is the number one strategic priority for companies. American firms annually invest about 20 percent of their revenue (or $40 billion) in R&D, making it the second-highest share of any major U.S. industry after the pharmaceutical industry. The industry’s R&D investments have paid off, with advanced semiconductors among the top five U.S. exports after aircraft, oil (crude and refined), and automobiles. Notably, 82 percent of the American industry’s revenue comes from overseas,  36 percent (or $70.5 billion) of which is from China. Export revenue is essential to U.S. firms’ ability to reinvest in the R&D required to remain on the cutting edge and maintain leadership in the industry given that federal government support to private sector semiconductor innovation is relatively limited. Although half of production by American firms takes place in the U.S. across 80 fabs and 19 states, U.S.-based fabs account for only 12 percent of the world’s manufacturing. The bulk of the production process has been shifting toward Asia so organizations could reduce costs, diversify their supplier base, and create resilient supply chains that can withstand shocks such as COVID-19 and mitigate fallout from trade disputes.  By 2022, the Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis of the U.S. Air Force estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge chip production will be based in Taiwan, South Korea, and China with U.S.-based global share of fab capacity dropping to 8 percent and Chinese capability increasing to 35 percent. This concentration of production and trend of American firms to increasingly rely on Asia for the manufacturing of semiconductor technologies poses risks to American economic competitiveness and national security should supply chains get further disrupted or U.S. firms become unable to operate or transport goods in the region.

              By 2022, the Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis of the U.S. Air Force estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge chip production will be based in Taiwan, South Korea, and China with U.S.-based global share of fab capacity dropping to 8 percent and Chinese capability increasing to 35 percent.
            
            This lack of U.S.-based manufacturing and overall industry consolidation is partly because of the immense cost of building and maintaining a fab, which ranges from $15 billion to $20 billion for a leading-edge facility. Manufacturing equipment is expensive, with front-end lithography equipment that is used to draw highly complex circuit patterns on wafers costing up to $100 million per unit. The next generation semiconductor manufacturing technology that will be used to create 7 nanometers or smaller semiconductors, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, costs $120 million to $170 million.  For advanced semiconductor production such as 5 nanometers, a single wafer can have up to 14 EUV layers applied to it, significantly increasing capital costs. Overall, creating a new fab in the U.S. costs an added 30 percent to 50 percent to build and operate over 10 years, compared to Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, or China. Beyond fab expenses, environmental regulations in the U.S. also deter investment in U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing. According to the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), the Federal Clean Air Act is perceived by the industry as a barrier to timely facility permitting. Pre-construction and operating permits are issued by state and local agencies, which for large projects can take 12 to 18 months to receive. In an industry where bringing projects to fruition is exceptionally important given the pace of competition and innovation, the lengthy permitting process can deter building facilities in the U.S.The decline of America’s share of global manufacturing is also attributed to the lack of incentives from the federal government, which have pushed firms to send production segments overseas, particularly in Asia. Industry leaders point to the U.S.’ corporate tax system, which has the highest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), relatively low R&D tax credits, and discourages capital investment in asset-heavy industries. Recognizing the trend and with growing strategic concerns over weakening U.S. domestic semiconductor capability, provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2021 under title XCIX, “Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America,” offer companies up to $3 billion to build a U.S.-based fab. This is the only existing government incentive program designed to spur construction of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, with Capitol Hill staffers stating that the provision is meant to strengthen the entire supply chain. The industry has applauded the enactment and is urging Congress to immediately allocate funding. Some experts are skeptical as to whether the NDAA provision will successfully promote U.S.-based chip manufacturing or, instead, motivate China to further strengthen its efforts toward indigenization. Given the highly globalized nature of the supply chain and the unique nature of each stage of the production process, the broad NDAA provision is unlikely to be able to address all the weaknesses of the entire value chain model. Other supportive legislation such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act, proposed in Congress in June 2020, which includes a larger, $22 billion incentive program, and an income tax credit for chip equipment and manufacturing, and the American Foundries Act of 2020, which authorizes $25 billion for R&D, facility construction, equipment, and IP acquisitions, could further support the industry, but both have yet to be passed and now stand in committees.China has long prioritized the development of its technology sector with goals of digital self-reliance and primacy that officials contend will foster self-sustaining growth through domestic consumer spending. However, competitive semiconductor manufacturing is essential to realize this vision, and China plays a limited role in the production process, owning only 5 percent of the total chip share and primarily participating in the manufacturing and the ATP segments of the supply chain. It is heavily dependent on imports and consumes more than 60 percent of all semiconductors in the global market for internal use and eventual export in the form of Chinese-made technology such as smartphones, computers, telecommunication networks, and more. China’s import dependence coupled with national security concerns, specifically the possibility that adversaries could intentionally install and exploit vulnerabilities into devices for intelligence and military purposes, has the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) doubling down on bolstering its domestic chip capacity to mitigate supply chain risks and to support the country’s tech-driven international competitiveness.According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, China’s goal is to create a “closed-loop semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem” from raw material and equipment production to the final product. In other words, China wants to catch up with—and then surpass—Western competitors in the semiconductor value chain, which risks disrupting the industry at large. Through the 2014 National Integrated Circuit Plan, China has worked to establish itself as a leader in the semiconductor industry throughout the supply chain by 2030 and has been advancing its agenda by restricting market access for foreign semiconductor products, forcing technology transfers to acquire IP, offering generous subsidies, and mobilizing state-owned enterprises. Aligned with the Made in China 2025 initiative launched in 2015—which seeks to shift China from being a low-end manufacturer to a high-end producer of goods, particularly in areas pertaining to information technology and telecommunications, advanced robotics, and AI—the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (also known as the Big Fund) allocated an initial $22 billion to semiconductor development. Since 2014, China has invested $150 billion overall in its domestic semiconductor industry—equivalent to China’s annual total semiconductor market value and twice what the global industry spends annually on R&D—through investments from all levels of government.

              Despite China’s immense resource allocation to its semiconductor sector, 84 percent of China’s semiconductors are still imported or made domestically by foreign manufacturers.
            

            However, despite China’s immense resource allocation to its semiconductor sector, 84 percent of China’s semiconductors are still imported or made domestically by foreign manufacturers. In fact, the largest Chinese-based integrated circuit (IC) foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), is four years behind in terms of innovation compared with market leaders in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea. Desperate for core IP to enable production of the most advanced semiconductors, from 2015 to 2017, Chinese investors tried to acquire U.S. and European-based firms such as Micron Technology, Western Digital Corporation, and Lattice, but governments blocked their efforts because of security concerns. Recognizing the gap, in 2019, China announced an extra $29 billion in funding via the Big Fund, and President Xi Jinping pledged $1.4 trillion through 2025 to further develop emerging tech as part of a new infrastructure initiative and ongoing effort to establish itself as a world-class chip giant and an international standard-setter for a range of high-tech, semiconductor-powered applications (such as 5G). Despite the funding, China’s ambitions are being hindered by a growing trend among private companies to move operations out of China because of rising labor costs, the instability of the Chinese market from the U.S.-China trade war, and the COVID-19 pandemic undermining confidence in China’s manufacturing sector. Companies are shifting their supply chains out of China to neighboring Asian countries, notably Vietnam, for its younger workforce, tax benefits, relatively weak regulations, six-day workweeks, and 40 percent lower labor costs. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, for example, announced in 2020 that it would move some of its iPad and MacBook assembly to Vietnam at the request of Apple to minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. In 2021, iPhone assembler Wistron similarly moved 50 percent of its production outside of China to India and Vietnam. As companies look to more attractive markets, China must adapt to the changing global economic landscape to maintain its growth.
          To combat Chinese tech ambitions, maintain its leadership in the semiconductor industry, and curtail the use of U.S. cutting-edge technology and know-how by Chinese companies, the Trump administration leveraged the powers of the exports control regime and ramped up activity in 2018. Through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS)—which reviews foreign direct investments and allows the president to suspend or block foreign mergers and acquisitions if they present credible threats to national security—the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Trump administration sought to squeeze out China from the semiconductor supply chain. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, after broadening CFIUS’s oversight to include critical technology and critical infrastructure, CFIUS opened 443 investigations within President Trump’s first three years, resulting in more cross-border transaction reviews—notably for the semiconductor industry. CFIUS was also responsible for stopping Broadcom’s acquisition of Qualcomm, citing that the merger could cut U.S. investments into semiconductors and wireless tech, giving Huawei a lead in the industry.In addition to foreign investments, the former administration targeted global supply chains, which has had cascading effects for the global industry. The government expanded the definition of the foreign direct product rule through the USDOC to require a license for the use of any products that relied on American technology and software. The expanded rule disincentivizes foundries around the world such as TSMC, Applied Materials, KLA, and LAM research from working with HiSilicon, Huawei’s in-house production unit, by threatening to ban companies’ access to new tools from American firms. After the USDOC’s rulings, TSMC complied with U.S. export controls and stopped taking orders from Huawei, who was then TSMC’s second largest customer after Apple. TSMC subsequently announced plans to build a 5 nanometer chip plant in Arizona that could create 1,900 jobs over five years. Huawei was later added to the USDOC’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List in 2019, followed by SMIC and 60 other entities in 2020, a measure that effectively restricts those entities’ access to American SMEs because of their ties to the Chinese military, human rights abuses, and/or theft of U.S. trade secrets. The Trump administration took other unilateral actions to limit trade in sensitive technologies, including leveraging Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, to “mitigate Chinese mercantilist practices” that the administration charged were unreasonable or discriminatory, and burdened or restricted U.S. commerce. In March 2018, the USTR also filed a report on China’s trade policy practices, citing abuses related to IP, leading to U.S. imposed tariffs on China. (Despite its impacts, legal questions remain regarding the Trump administration’s use of Section 301 given that legal experts assert the U.S. should not use Section 301 unilaterally to confront trade practices.)The Trump administration’s protectionist measures have reinforced President Xi’s ambitions to decouple Sino-American economic ties (despite his recent calls for multilateralism and global collaboration). One year after Huawei was put onto the U.S. Entity List, for example, local Chinese semiconductor companies were able to capitalize on the absence of American firms. Although performance is not equivalent to U.S. designs, China’s efforts to localize semiconductor manufacturing point to longer-term pressure on U.S. companies’ market share there. To further circumvent U.S. measures, Xi has been creating industrial backup systems to replace American-led industrial and financial institutions and address the “changes in the global political and economic environment, the upsurge in deglobalization, unilateralism, and protectionism by [the United States].” For instance, after China’s SMIC was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2019, the CCP announced plans to raise $2.8 billion through the Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR Market), a tech-centered exchange modeled after the Nasdaq that supports the Made in China 2025 initiative and provides an alternative forum for corporations to raise capital. According to Refinitiv, STAR ranks second behind the Nasdaq in terms of IPO’s value after several semiconductor firms, namely SMIC, joined the listings in 2020. Today, STAR includes 120 corporations and is valued at $400 billion. While small compared to the Nasdaq, which tracks 3,300 companies and has a market cap of $19.06 trillion, it is symbolic and is growing.

              China’s recent rule changes and rising tensions in the tech-war demonstrate increasing difficulty for companies and countries, such as TSMC and Taiwan, to pursue strategic autonomy amid potential economic decoupling between the U.S. and China.
            

            Throughout the trade conflict, Sino-American relations have been principled on reciprocity, or tit-for-tat, with both countries using tariffs, sanctions, and export controls to influence each other’s behavior. In January 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce promulgated a bylaw that discourages companies from taking steps to comply with U.S. economic sanctions and export-control restrictions imposed by the U.S. government over the past year, including TSMC’s refusal to work with Huawei. Citing reciprocity, the law stipulates national sovereignty matters and gives Chinese firms the right to sue a foreign company for abiding by American rules. Although some commenters characterize TSMC’s decision to “side” with the U.S. (illustrated by its cutting off business ties with Huawei) as a win for President Trump, China’s recent rule changes and rising tensions in the tech-war demonstrate increasing difficulty for companies and countries, such as TSMC and Taiwan, to pursue strategic autonomy amid potential economic decoupling between the U.S. and China.
          Despite all its initiatives and funding, China struggles to achieve its goals and lags considerably behind U.S. and other global semiconductors manufacturers. Analysts estimate that China's share of the semiconductor market will be 40 percent in 2025, short of the government's goal of 70 percent. China is falling short of its ambitions to become a global standard-setter, which would require producing advanced chips within a Chinese semiconductor sector that is, at least two to three generations behind leading edge companies like TSMC and Samsung. China will need at minimum five to 10 years to catch up in terms of technological sophistication. Indeed, the U.S.-China trade war has harmed China’s indigenization efforts, but China’s lack of success in developing a self-reliant chip ecosystem is because of several bottlenecks throughout the global supply chain that its industry is facing, including limited access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software, and a lack of talent and expertise.Industry analysts estimate that China’s plans to create new fabs and expand capacity will drive China’s equipment spending to more than $40 billion in 2025. Although China already invests heavily in equipment with 80 domestic companies devoted to semiconductor equipment research and manufacturing, it has limited capability to manufacture any equipment locally and still depends on American, Taiwanese, South Korean, and Japanese suppliers for critical production materials such as high-end photoresist materials. As a result, China has sought to reduce its import dependence by purchasing used machines and luring companies such as Intel, Samsung, and SK Hynix to set up fabs in China to meet local demand and increase China’s overall semiconductor exports. But U.S. export restrictions blocking Chinese SME companies such as SMIC, Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC), and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) from accessing the global supply chain have hindered China’s capability building, particularly in obtaining cutting-edge lithography machines and essential manufacturing chemicals.In addition, while the creation of the Big Fund is China’s primary source of financing for the development of foundational semiconductor devices, little transparency or accountability exists for how the money is spent. Local governments have reportedly invested and approved chip projects blindly without sufficient knowledge about the industry or the manufacturing process, leading to dozens of failed and stagnant chip companies. In 2020, after the collapse of high-profile companies such as Tsinghua Unigroup and Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor (HSMC), the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) warned that local governments will be held accountable if projects result in huge losses, waste resources, or “invoke big risks.” Chinese investors and executives have stated that Chinese fabless firms are “too immature” to use funding effectively. It is unclear how the Big Fund’s resources have been spent to date, particularly given that over 50,000 entities are registered as “semiconductor” companies, which risks investment fragmentation, and most of known funding appears to be used to expand fab capacity—not R&D.

              Given the nature of the semiconductor industry that requires decades of research and accumulated expertise to create cutting-edge technology, experts contend that China will not be able to resolve its human capital deficit within five to 10 years.
            
            Finally, although foreign technology acquisition, collaboration, and transfer through joint ventures, licensing agreements, and U.S.-led open-source technology platforms for chip design have marginally improved China’s domestic production efforts, China fundamentally lacks the knowledge to produce cutting-edge ICs. It remains dependent on foreign talent for technical know-how and has used its resources to aggressively attract employees from top firms. Chinese companies offer double or triple existing salaries of chip experts in Taiwan, resulting in as many as 3,000 Taiwanese engineers joining China’s leading chipmakers in 2019 and at least 100 former TSMC engineers in 2020. Huawei’s addition to the U.S. Entity List has spurred Beijing to accelerate recruitment efforts and raised concerns from American firms about Taiwan’s ability to protect U.S. companies’ IP given that, in addition to design and other forms of intellectual property, a company’s tacit knowledge resides in its employees. The effectiveness of China’s recruitment approach, however, is still limited given that the number of engineers needed to run a facility can range from 1,000 to well over 3,000, making it unlikely that China will be able to obtain the necessary people in the immediate or medium term.
          The Chinese education and technical training systems also are not producing the skilled workforce China needs to scale up its production process. For decades, China has maintained a strategy of revitalizing China through science and education, and launched its first semiconductor school in 2020. As the Big Fund demonstrates, the Chinese system is highly effective at shifting resources to address critical shortages in its economy. However, given the nature of the semiconductor industry that requires decades of research and accumulated expertise to create cutting-edge technology, experts contend that China will not be able to resolve its human capital deficit within five to 10 years. It will be a multidecade process to assemble the critical mass of skilled workers and IP that underpin Western companies’ competitiveness, particularly in the upstream portion of the supply chain. And even then, China is unlikely to be able to replicate the entire ecosystem that other companies such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC have cultivated (and continue to cultivate) over decades and with billions of dollars in investments. Even if China successfully develops domestic fab capabilities, Chinese firms will continue to rely on American, European, Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese firms for chip technology and materials. Moreover, the semiconductor ecosystem is constantly evolving as companies continue to innovate and increase the efficiency of their production models. It will become increasingly difficult for China, particularly when it lacks access to industry leaders, to continually manage every part of the supply chain given that, depending on the chip type and a particular production node, continuous management of all key suppliers and an ongoing process of optimization will be required.
          At the center of growing U.S.-China tech tensions and struggle for tech supremacy is Taiwan, which plays a critical role in the manufacturing advanced logic chips that are used in aircraft, satellites, drones, wireless communications, data centers, automobiles, and other technology that the U.S. and China (as well as countries around the world) rely on for their economic and national security. Taiwan’s semiconductor industry is highly concentrated and is dominated by two manufactures, TSMC and United Microelectronics Company (UMC). Ranking third in global semiconductor leadership, TSMC is the world’s top pure-play foundry. Currently, only three companies in the world—Intel, Samsung, and TSMC—are capable of manufacturing advanced semiconductors (7 nanometers or smaller). In 2020, TSMC raised its R&D spending by 24 percent to $3.7 billion to stay competitive. Intel ranked first in terms of the industry’s total R&D expenditures, accounting for 19 percent (or $12.9 billion) of the industry’s total, while Samsung, ranked second in 2020, increased its R&D spending by 19 percent (or $5.6 billion) in leading-edge logic processes to compete with TSMC.

              As rivals like UMC and Samsung fall behind technologically, China-based SMIC struggles with American restrictions, and Intel considers outsourcing to TSMC after several in-house slip-ups, TSMC’s “pivotal role” in the tech industry will likely expand in 2021.
            

            TSMC is essential to the supply chain, particularly for clients such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Xilinx, and MediaTek, which design bespoke technology but do not have the capacity to develop the most advanced chips at high volumes. According to industry experts, as rivals like UMC and Samsung fall behind technologically, China-based SMIC struggles with American restrictions, and Intel considers outsourcing to TSMC after several in-house slip-ups, TSMC’s “pivotal role” in the tech industry will likely expand in 2021. However, government officials and business leaders are increasingly concerned about the risks posed by the disproportionate and growing reliance on TSMC for critical chips, particularly given Taiwan’s economic ties to China and increasing U.S.-China tensions surrounding Taiwan.
          Although Taiwan has been trying to reduce ties with China by increasing trade and investment with regional neighbors through its 2016 New Southbound Policy, Taiwan and TSMC are heavily dependent on both China and the U.S. for most of their economic activity and technological development. China is Taiwan’s biggest trading partner, representing 24.3 percent of its total trade and 20.1 percent of Taiwan’s imports in 2019. Taiwan relies on the Chinese market for a significant portion of its semiconductor sales and manufacturing with one-third of purchases by Chinese importers for semiconductors (some of which were also used by Taiwanese firms in China). According to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), more than 70.8 percent of Taiwan’s information and communication technology (ICT) related products were manufactured in China. China’s market demand increased TSMC’s revenue by 17 percent (or $6.9 billion) in 2019, effectively more than doubling China’s share of the company’s sales from 9 percent to 20 percent from 2016 to 2019. Overall, Taiwan’s exports in semiconductors and semiconductor-enabled devices to China grew nearly 89 percent from 2014 to 2019.By comparison, the U.S. is Taiwan’s second largest trading partner, accounting for 13.2 percent of total trade and 12.2 percent of Taiwan imports. Taiwan is also an important trading partner for the U.S. as the U.S.’ 10th largest goods trading partner, with $85.5 billion in total two-way goods trade. For TSMC, North America accounts for 59 percent of its total revenue, which is critical for its ability to reinvest in R&D. As the “Global Path of a Semiconductor” map demonstrates, the semiconductor supply chain relies on a handful of American companies for specific production steps, particularly electronic design automation (EDA) software and SMEs. EDA software is necessary to design any chips and leading vendors—Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor Graphics—which are all American, often work closely with foundries and SME producers. The SME market is similarly dominated by American firms making all global chip firms, TSMC and SMIC included, reliant on U.S.-based firms for their semiconductor equipment and software to run its fabs. According to the Taiwan Machine Tool and Accessory Builders’ Association, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry is “overwhelmingly dependent on imported production equipment,” with 90 percent of SME coming from abroad.  Deeply integrated into U.S. and Chinese supply chains, TSMC owns 55 percent of the Chinese foundry market (compared to SMIC’s 19 percent) and has three wholly owned subsidiary fabs in China and the U.S. with another fab planning to be built in Arizona. The graphic below shows the inter-dependence of Taiwan, the U.S., and China for growth in the semiconductor market. It highlights how the trade measures imposed by the Trump administration significantly affected U.S.-China trade flows as Chinese exports to the U.S. decreased by 45 percent during this time period. Deteriorating trade relations and rising costs of semiconductor R&D adversely impact chip firms’ abilities to reinvest revenue into critical research necessary to remain at the cutting edge.The following graphic shows the percentage change in semiconductor trade flows (imports and exports) between China, Taiwan, and the U.S. from 2014 to 2019, and the countries’ interdependence.In billions of U.S. dollarsIn billions of U.S. dollarsSources: World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), U.N.

Note, significant discrepancies exist between China and U.S. reporting. As such, for U.S.-China bilateral semiconductor trade, the graphic reflects U.S.-reported data for both imports from and exports to China. All import and export data related to Taiwan is reported from the Taiwan Ministry of Finance, as the WITS database does not include Taiwan.Re-exports and re-imports, fabrication materials such as silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen, ATP packaging materials such as ceramic packaging, glues and adhesives, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment are not included in this data.As tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait and U.S.-China relations steadily degrade under mounting economic and technological pressure, Taiwan has become a flashpoint for potential commercial and regional security instability. This risks not only the disruption of the global semiconductor supply chains and, by extension, myriad technology-based manufacturing processes, but Taiwan’s domestic economic security as the semiconductor industry accounts for 15 percent of the country’s GDP with TSMC contributing about 4 percent of it. At the same time, the Taiwanese industry has shown enormous adaptability amid challenging regional dynamics and shocks to the supply chain, including those unleashed by COVID-19. According to the MOEA, the country’s export orders grew by an annual 10 percent (or $534 billion) in 2020. As a critical part of the government’s Six Core Strategic Industries, President Tsai Ing-wen has been committed to accelerating the industry’s development from talent cultivation programs to financial support. In 2016, Taiwan launched the Asian Silicon Valley project, to which the administration allocated $350 million (or 11.3 billion New Taiwan dollars) to support its startup ecosystem by partnering with U.S.-based firms to gain firsthand knowledge of the American market. Through collaboration with American companies, aggressive investment in higher education, tech transfers, targeted R&D funds into electronics, and its homegrown venture capital industry, Taiwan’s dependence on the IT sector, particularly the semiconductor industry, has been critical to its overall economic development. In 2020, the Taiwanese federal government provided an added $260 million in subsidies for the development of its domestic semiconductor industry. According to the MOEA, Taiwan’s semiconductor sector is estimated to grow to $169.76 billion by 2030.However, overlaying political dynamics of Taiwan’s sovereignty continue to complicate the stability and security of the chip supply chain. China considers Taiwan to be firmly under the “One China” policy and has never excluded the potential use of force to assert its position. Although the U.S. has historically acknowledged but not affirmed the “Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China,” the Trump administration before leaving office sought to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations. Overt diplomatic and military relations between the U.S. and Taiwan such as several high-ranking official visits, the dedication of $250 million to upgrade the unofficial embassy in Taipei, and a provision of enhanced military capabilities  (with air-to-ground missiles that can be used with F-16 fighter jets that the U.S. also sold to Taiwan) have heightened tensions and increasingly angered China. In response, China warned fiercely “not to send any wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence’ [in order] to avoid severe damage to China-U.S. relations,” and most recently sanctioned former officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for their anti-China policies and violating China’s sovereignty. It is unmistakable that the threat to Taiwan from China is growing with disinformation campaigns,  cyberattacks,  political influence operations,  and Chinese military flyovers crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which had not happened in 20 years.For now, the country’s silicon-based semiconductor sector has mitigated overt conflict between the U.S. and China given the significant role Taiwan plays in the supply chain and has been referred to as a “Silicon Shield” to hedge against potential aggression from China. TSMC is China’s biggest contract supplier, selling $7 billion worth of chips to China in 2019. TSMC’s production capacity, innovative chip manufacturing, and reputation for protecting IP make it, and Taiwan in general, highly valuable for the U.S., China, and the private sector. Although the Taiwanese semiconductor industry has tried to maintain friendly ties with both sides, the government’s dependency on the U.S. for its defensive security combined with the intensifying tech war is pulling Taiwan closer to the U.S. This geopolitical nexus is increasingly dominating the outlook for global technology and commercial security. Supply chain uncertainty is no longer limited to the private sector, and control over semiconductors is becoming the new strategic national security fulcrum of the 21st century.The Trump administration’s “America First” policy stance recognized China’s growing assertiveness in the international arena with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy Report specifically pointing to cooperation with allies and like-minded partners such as Taiwan on areas of advanced technology research and infrastructure movement to “prevent China’s industrial policies and unfair trading practices from distorting global markets and harming U.S. competitiveness.” Although the administration’s use of export controls, tariffs, and limitations on the industry have hindered Huawei and China’s chip independence efforts by restricting access to critical players such as TSMC, leading to Huawei announcing it was running low on chips under U.S. sanctions, the measures have harmed American firms as well.

              In the long run, pinching the supply chain to weaken China will hinder U.S. firms’ ability to innovate and optimize operations and could ultimately undermine the U.S. high-tech industry. 
            

            Underdiscussed tension is growing within the U.S. between Washington, D.C., and tech firms with respect to Sino-American relations. Rather than a security risk, Silicon Valley largely recognizes the value of China more as a competitive location for manufacturing and a critical source of revenue essential to further reinvestment in R&D. Despite increasingly antagonistic rhetoric and calls for economic decoupling, the U.S. and China remain highly interconnected and dependent on each other. The Chinese market represents almost two-fifths of U.S. semiconductor total revenue. Given that the U.S. federal government provides relatively little support for R&D funding compared to China, the American semiconductor industry is highly reliant on its export revenue from China to generate the funds needed to maintain firms’ competitiveness and drive further innovation. In the long run, pinching the supply chain to weaken China will hinder U.S. firms’ ability to innovate and optimize operations and could ultimately undermine the U.S. high-tech industry. The impacts of supply chain disruptions and segmentation are clear, as illustrated by the recent halts in production plants across the automobile and smartphone industries where chip shortages have prevented companies from fulfilling the growing demand for technology amid the pandemic. The automotive industry, in particular, has been harmed by chip shortages with industry analysts predicting that the effects of which could cripple automobile companies until 2023.
          Uncertainty around the future of supply chains and market access has incentivized countries to invest in competing U.S. versus China production models and localize production. Despite dependence on U.S. and Chinese markets, Taiwanese firms are seeking to secure their own supply chains amid the U.S.-China tech war. As a protective measure, in December 2020, the Taiwan’s government and industry groups announced “post-globalization defense move[s]” and plans to localize SME production and reduce dependency on American firms to preemptively address potential supply chain disruptions to critical manufacturing equipment.After the increasingly restrictive U.S. trade measures and concerns over unpredictable trade and export policies, companies around the world have sought out other partners and new markets to build semiconductor devices using non-U.S. equipment and reduce reliance on U.S. R&D. Following Huawei’s addition to the U.S. Entity List, Huawei approached TSMC and Samsung to build advanced process lines based on non-U.S. equipment and to produce chips under the U.S. ban. Although Samsung asserted that it would stop trading with Huawei as of September 2020, U.S. vendors are challenging U.S. regulations by expressing intent to participate in China’s 5G growth, which companies such as Intel and Micron Technologies did in 2019 by avoiding labeling goods as American-made. U.S. restrictions are also motivating smaller companies that have suffered losses from the U.S.-China trade war to work with Chinese companies to target American firms. In 2018, Taiwan’s UMC pled guilty to working with Chinese-based Fujian Jinhua (JHICC) to hack a computer memory chip stolen from American firm Micron Technologies to facilitate China’s self-sufficiency in computer memory production—a strategic priority for China. UMC is seen as a major casualty of the U.S.-China trade war and the company has long been cooperative with Chinese chipmakers, particularly JHICC, which planned to build a fab using UMC technology in 2019. But after JHICC was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2018, it had to halt production, and both companies suffered significant revenue losses. U.S. restrictions risk fueling distrust between countries and companies, with U.S. allies asserting that they cannot be sure about America’s long-term commitments to international economic stability after four years of unilateral approaches to China overall. Going forward, constructive engagement among U.S. friends, partners, and allies as well as the private sector is necessary to stabilize the global supply chain and ensure that tech firms do not suffer undue costs and inadvertently undermine the U.S. and its allies’ economic competitiveness.As tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait, business leaders and decision-makers alike are increasingly concerned about the disproportionate concentration of chips and reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors. Security experts assert Beijing is “more willing to take risks internationally and with a larger and more coercive toolkit than ever before,” risking the possibility of military conflict breaking out and disrupting a critical link of the supply chain. Military action, be it invasion or a blockade, in the Taiwan Strait may prevent corporations from being able to transport goods in and out Taiwan. The experiences from the past few years, particularly those with respect to the U.S. tightening restrictions on Chinese high-tech and exerting influence on Taiwan’s semiconductor firms, will not only drive Beijing to work to mitigate damages to its chip efforts but may push China to exert nonmilitary punitive measures, such as economic coercion and cyberattacks on semiconductor companies and Taiwan more broadly.For China, conflict in the Taiwan Strait remains risky, especially as assessments of Chinese maritime power finds that although China has steadily built up its naval capabilities over the past 30 years with Taiwan as a primary inflection point, it lacks the means to accomplish a successful invasion. In addition to enhanced asymmetrical Taiwanese defense capabilities, U.S. support to Taiwan, China’s reliance on Taiwan’s manufacturing hub, the seasonal environmental variation of the strait that affects maritime navigability and makes it geographically hazardous for ships, the risks and costs of conflict are high. Regional experts note that there does not appear to be any urgency from Beijing for reunification given that conflict in the Taiwan Strait could potentially damage other Chinese interests, notably Xi’s goal for “economic rejuvenation” by 2049. Xi’s rhetoric is consistent with that of previous rulers regarding Taiwan and appears to recognize the risk conflict in the Taiwan Strait could pose to China’s economic and technological growth. Should China resort to the use of force, chips could be potentially used as part of China’s justification for war, but chips will likely not be the driving force for conflict.Although China has not imposed significant economic sanctions or other restrictive measures in Taiwan to date, it could take more aggressive actions if leaders perceive a threat to its strategic interests. Recent actions against Canada for arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and Australia for barring Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks are illustrative. In addition, recent legislation from China’s Ministry of Commerce that allows Huawei to sue TSMC over its chip ban and the Foreign Ministry’s threats to cut off the U.S. from critical material supplies, including silicon and gallium, which are essential to create semiconductors and other high-tech products, indicate that China may be willing to exercise similar measures against Taiwan after TSMC’s decision to abide by American regulations.

              Access to core IP risks undermining Taiwan and the U.S.’ competitiveness and security as it would help China to build advanced technology as well as identify (and potentially exploit) hidden vulnerabilities in critical computing hardware over the longer term.
            

            Although China continues to leverage its “market for technology” through its equity restrictions and administrative approvals and by granting foreign investors limited market access if they can transfer advanced technologies to China, China may increase its cyberespionage activities to secure core IP for advanced semiconductor designs should it be unable to access the semiconductor equipment and devices it needs. Such a risk is heightening concerns among industry players given China’s advanced cyber capabilities, which ranks second behind the U.S. in sophistication and ability to achieve its policy objectives in the cyber domain. China has indeed used its cyber capabilities against private corporations for similar objectives, with hackers associated with the Ministry of State Security running a 12-year IP theft campaign against 45 tech companies and other Chinese hackers targeting more than 100 entities, including software development companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunication providers, and governments for confidential information. Most recently, in August 2020, Chinese state-sponsored hacker group Winnti (otherwise known as Barium, Axiom, or Chimera) launched Operation Skeleton Key to “steal as much intellectual property as possible, including source code, software development kits, and chip designs” from Taiwanese semiconductor firms based in Hsinchu Industrial Park, Taiwan’s technology hub. Cybersecurity experts note that China’s attack on Taiwan is one example of a larger trend of China using cyber tactics to “shift the power relationship up and down the [semiconductor] supply chain.” Access to core IP risks undermining Taiwan and the U.S.’ competitiveness and security as it would help China to build advanced technology as well as identify (and potentially exploit) hidden vulnerabilities in critical computing hardware over the longer term.
          Although the Biden administration has said it intends to cooperate with China in areas of overlapping interest such as global health, nuclear weapons proliferation, and climate change, it has also signaled that tensions between the U.S. and China over semiconductors will continue under President Biden. In an interview at the Hudson Institute, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “the status quo [with China] was not really sustainable particularly when it comes to China’s commercial and economic practices, the lack of reciprocity in the relationships needs to be dealt with…We are in a competition with China, and there’s nothing wrong with competition if it’s fair.” Biden has also similarly criticized China’s economic behavior, citing Beijing’s unfair subsidies to state-owned firms and “robbing” U.S. companies of technology. In the short run, foreign policy experts assert that the administration will likely exacerbate trade conflicts with China given the administration’s goals to bolster U.S.-made goods, subsidize domestic industries, and ban foreign companies from government procurement. Moreover, Biden has stated that he will not immediately reverse the trade measures, including restrictions on semiconductors and advanced technologies, until the U.S. consults with allies.Unlike the previous administration, the Biden team is prioritizing a multilateral, ally-focused approach with initiatives aimed to boost American economic competitiveness to curb China’s rise rather than use punitive measures. The administration could build security and resiliency in the semiconductor supply chain and the industry at large by working with Taiwan along with like-minded allies toward their common objectives. Both the U.S. and Taiwan seek to reduce their reliance on Chinese suppliers for key components and materials. The Taiwanese government has implemented rules to ensure that American companies’ properties and interests are safeguarded in the Trade Secrets Act and the Copyright Act, as demonstrated by the government’s indictment of UMC’s actions with JJHIC against Micron Technologies. Given Taiwan’s essential role in the foundry segment of the supply chain, Taiwanese firms could work with American companies to reorient their production models and diversify their supply chains, both in terms of physical manufacturing locations and its suppliers.Another core element of the administration’s agenda to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign manufacturers is enhancing domestic manufacturing. In particular, it is devoting $300 billion to research and development efforts in “breakthrough technologies” such as AI, 5G, and electric vehicles, and $400 billion for a “Buy American” procurement fund to incentivize manufacturers. The Biden administration has also promised, within the first 100 days of his presidency, to initiate an ongoing, governmentwide process to monitor supply chain vulnerabilities, close identified gaps, build resiliency so the supply chain can withstand shocks like COVID-19, and “crack down on anti-competitive practices.” In February 2020, President Biden followed through on his promise, after announcing plans to sign an executive order to address semiconductor shortages and evaluate the current state of the supply chain. These initiatives are critical to maintaining the U.S. lead in the semiconductor industry, and more broadly, ensuring that the U.S. has continued access to essential technology. TSMC’s new factory in Arizona is a significant step toward bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., but more work must be done. Some companies have looked to move their operations out of Taiwan, but not necessarily to the U.S., because of costs to build and maintain a fab there.Given the Trump administration’s anti-China policies over the past four years, China may push Biden to take a more definitive stance on the One China policy and establish boundaries on U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan. But while the Biden administration will likely be less public about American cooperation with Taiwan than the Trump administration, early signals by the Biden team, such as Blinken’s outward support for closer U.S.-Taiwan economic relations, indicate strong support for stronger U.S.-Taiwan ties. Phone calls between national security advisor Jake Sullivan and President Tsai, the White House National Security Council’s statement committing “rock solid” support to Taiwan, and Taiwan’s de-facto ambassador to the U.S. attending Biden’s inauguration for the first time indicate that Taiwan will remain a focal point. Biden’s appointment of Katherine Tai, who spent seven years litigating against China on behalf of the U.S. at the World Trade Organization as U.S. Trade Representative, further demonstrates U.S. resolve to hold China accountable on trade practices. Similarly, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in her Senate confirmation hearing that she will be “very aggressive in combating China’s unfair trade practices” and work with allies to address China’s IP theft, state subsidies, and efforts to block out Western companies from the Chinese market.Semiconductors represent an essential building block for all digital goods and services, and are fundamental for advanced manufacturing and military applications. The proliferation of IoT devices, increasing integration of artificial intelligence, and the drive for quantum computing will only compound demand and raise the stakes for industry and our economies on which they increasingly depend. The U.S.-China-Taiwan nexus demonstrates the complex economic, technological, and geopolitical dynamics at each node of the semiconductor supply chain and highlights the importance of this strategic economic and technological conflict for foreign policy going forward.  The U.S.-China trade war and associated supply chain disruptions have been a wake-up call for the industry, forcing companies to thoroughly evaluate and map out their production and supply chains. Shortages of materials, components, and finished goods have reduced the industry’s short-term growth, and many firms acknowledge that they are unaware of the tiers of suppliers they rely on.

              The U.S.-China trade war and associated supply chain disruptions have been a wake-up call for the industry, forcing companies to thoroughly evaluate and map out their production and supply chains. 
            
            As semiconductors play an increasingly important role in the global economic and security arena, tension is growing between national security and commercial interests and creates potential for conflict. Existing multinational frameworks such as the 1996 Wassenaar Agreement (WA), the first global arrangement on export controls for conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies, including semiconductors and related technologies, attempts to address supply chain issues by increasing transparency and cooperation among member states on export controls. The agreement is not itself legally binding with enforcement coming from the 42 member countries themselves and the WA notably does not include Taiwan or China—although Taiwan does follow the international standards set by the agreement independently.  Other multi-stakeholder forums that include the private sector such as the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue (EPP) and the Strategic Economic Dialogue, which focus on U.S.-Taiwanese and Sino-American relations, respectively, are opportunities for comprehensive strategic cooperation on supply chain, telecommunication, and overall technology security.
          Although China is unlikely to achieve advanced independent semiconductor manufacturing in the near term, increased collaboration among all global actors of the industry—private and public—is necessary to help ensure resilient supply chains. Beyond strengthening IP rules and establishing a fair standard of trade practices, further attention must be given to current tax policies and structures in the U.S. that disincentivize companies from investing in local manufacturing facilities, streamlining the permit process to reduce the time it takes to obtain permission to build domestic fabs, and increasing transparency in the export control process, specifically the exceptions to commerce rules that are currently not public information. Consideration of industry input by Congress and relevant agencies could help ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken to address key supply chain risks that companies face. This includes applying the scope of Huawei-related Entity List prohibitions to all entity lists, such as anti-terrorism-only and EAR99 technology, which industry associations argue will advance U.S. tech leadership while allowing non-U.S. member to contribute unpublished U.S.-origin technology. More narrowly defining foundational technologies and national security objectives to clarify what technologies fall within the scope of potential controls, and implementing a metric to assess the impact export controls may have on industries before adding entities to the Department of Commerce’s BIS, could also help manage policy impacts.The Biden administration’s focus on multilateralism and enhancing U.S. economic competitiveness to curb China’s rise in the global arena opens opportunities for cross-regional and cross-sector collaboration. As the world becomes more interconnected and emerging technology redefines society, the U.S. will need to rely on its friends, partners, and allies whose contributions to the semiconductor ecosystem stimulate innovation and sustained global economic growth going forward.Written by Helen You.

376,Benchmarking the global 5G experience,Networking/Telecom,https://www.opensignal.com/2021/02/03/benchmarking-the-global-5g-experience,"February 03, 2021 by Ian Fogg5G is still near the beginning of its decade-long era. No mobile technology stands still, so we must continue to analyze the real-world experience and see how it changes and improves. Here we analyze Opensignal’s global 5G data from real mobile users to identify the leading countries and quantify their 5G mobile experience.In most countries, operators have, to date, launched just the very first version of the 5G standard using a single wireless 5G frequency band. But in others we’ve seen operators start to move ahead by offering 5G on multiple spectrum bands, or use mmWave technologies to offer extremely fast speeds. While in other countries, most notably in the Americas and parts of South-East Asia, operators have initially been constrained by the limited availability of 5G-suitable spectrum.We saw big improvements in 4G technology in its first decade.[1] To understand if similar jumps forward are happening with 5G, we need to monitor how the real-world 5G experience is evolving. In 2021, more operators hope to launch 5G on additional frequency bands, more operators intend to add extremely fast mmWave-based 5G, and more operators seek to launch newer versions of the 5G standard and offer users a fully 5G experience by shifting from non-standalone access (NSA) to standalone (SA) 5G.For 5G to be relevant to mainstream mobile users, the latest mobile technology must offer an excellent and superior mobile network experience. In this analysis, we quantify just how good the 5G experience can be. Yet, there are wide differences in the quality of the 5G experience globally. These global 5G country leaders indicate what’s already possible and how high to aim.South Korean users lead the world in 5G Download Speed with a score of 354.4 Mbps. Our users in six countries saw 5G Download Speed of over 200 Mbps — Australia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UAE — while in all ten countries our users observed average 5G download speeds of over 150 Mbps which represents much faster speeds than using 4G technology. 5G Download Speed represents the average speed using an active 5G connection. At first glance, these speeds may not appear especially fast because it’s possible, occasionally, for 4G technology to deliver an individual speed test that is much faster. But it’s unheard of for the average experience of 4G users to be in the hundreds of megabits per second in any country globally.When we look at the 5G Peak Download Speed — the average speed experienced by the top 2% of our users — we see an even faster experience. Peak speeds for the top ten 5G countries globally range from 862.6 Mbps to 575.4 Mbps. Saudi Arabia edges ahead of South Korea in 5G Peak Download Speed. Switzerland and Italy also move up the table.Netherlands tops the 5G Upload Speed ranking with a speed of 32.5 Mbps. Again, South Korea is only just behind and Taiwan and Switzerland both rank highly. All of these countries benefit from both excellent 5G rollouts but also a strong network foundation with high quality backhaul from cell towers — which is shared across 4G and 5G technologies — and effective core networks. Most current 5G deployments are using non-standalone access, where the overall 5G experience of users still in part relies on the capability of the 4G network because a 5G smartphone will connect to 4G spectrum at the same time as the smartphone has an active 5G connection.For multiplayer mobile gaming, industry expectations have been extremely high as operators hope to persuade gamers to upgrade to 5G. For now, just five countries rate as Excellent in Opensignal’s measure of Games Experience over a 5G network with scores over 85. But this will be an area to watch as more operators deploy 5G core networks and standalone 5G, where they aim to improve latency greatly. By contrast, in all top ten countries for 5G Video Experience our users enjoyed an “Excellent” experience on our one hundred point scale with scores over 80.Offering high speeds is not sufficient for mobile users to enjoy a great experience. For example, sometimes operators will throttle certain types of mobile data traffic — often video streams — which can have the effect of enabling very fast speed test results but offering users a poor video experience. At Opensignal, we test a range of mobile experiences including Video Experience, multiplayer mobile Games Experience and the experience of real-time Voice App Experience using popular communication apps. Emerging markets see some of the biggest jumps in mobile experience with 5G. In Thailand, our mobile users see 5G Download Speed 13.4 times faster than the 4G Download Speed — the greatest increase in the world — with Philippines second with 10.1 times and Saudi Arabia third. In the top three placed countries for 5G Download Speed — South Korea, UAE and Taiwan (see chart 1 above) — we also saw see a big leap in 5G speeds with scores 5.6, 6.6 and 7.7 times faster respectively. For Video Experience, the top two places are reversed. Philippines sees a 5G Video Experience that’s 40% higher than 4G Video Experience, with Thailand second on 29% better, and Hong Kong third with an improvement of 14%. In eight of the top ten countries for uplift in 5G Video Experience over 4G the increase for 5G over 4G was over 10%.There is no single way to measure the extent of a network.[2] Opensignal has developed two measures for the extent of 5G which offer complementary perspectives. Both 5G Availability and 5G Reach measure the real experience of the network as seen by our users, wherever they go, wherever they spend their time, indoors or outdoors, at all hours of the day. Neither rely on external data sources that are updated infrequently like census data for where people live, nor do Opensignal’s measures use mathematical estimations of network propagation. We measure the actual experience.5G Availability measures the proportion of time 5G users — those with both a 5G smartphone model and a 5G service plan — spend connected to an active 5G signal. When we look at the top ten countries globally, we find in six countries our users spend over one-fifth of their time connected to 5G with Kuwait top ranked with a score of 29.8%. Opensignal also looks at the locations where a 5G network is present. 5G Reach measures the user experience of the 5G rollout of an operator’s network. 5G Reach gives the average proportion of locations where 5G users have connected to a 5G network out of all the locations those users have visited measured on a scale of 0-10. In three places — South Korea, Hong Kong and Kuwait — we see a score of over five on our ten point scale, indicating a wide reach for 5G. Notably, the U.S. ranks highly on 5G Reach, in part because of the use of low frequency spectrum for 5G by all three U.S. operators. However, the U.S. is an outlier as most of the countries in the top ten for 5G Reach are smaller countries where it is easier for the operators to cover a wide part of the country with 5G service. Notes 1 With 4G, newer versions of the LTE standard added numerous capabilities such as the ability to combine the capacity across multiple frequency bands at once — carrier aggregation — to improve users’ speeds, or the ability to use newer higher resolution coding — 256 QAM — or advanced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies to squeeze better performance out of existing wireless bands.2 There are many different ways to look at the extent of a mobile network from the time spent connected, the geographic reach based on estimates of network propagation of where people live based on census data, or a dynamic reach based on where people spend their time, or a measure of the proportion of square kilometers reached. How coverage is measured can lead to different results when comparing indoors and outdoors or can depend on the type of equipment used by the user to connect to a wireless network (e.g. fixed wireless broadband sometimes relies on an external antenna attached to a building which can connect to weak signal while in other cases it uses an indoor router that needs a stronger signal in order to connect and be “in coverage”). The reach of a network also differs across wireless frequency bands and 5G services use a wide range of frequencies.Opensignal Limited retains ownership of this insight including all intellectual property rights, data, content, graphs & analysis.

377,Two new reports reveal the depths of Stadia’s struggles,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios,"Filed under:Wired and Bloomberg published new stories about Google’s cloud gaming serviceTwo new reports from Bloomberg and Wired have shed light on some of Google’s failures in building its Stadia cloud gaming service. The reports come just a few weeks after Google announced it would be shutting down its in-house Stadia game development studios.One key issue, according to Wired, is that Google may not have put as much investment in its internal studios as its much-hyped plans for Stadia may have suggested. Stadia chief Phil Harrison announced Google’s Stadia Games and Entertainment studios at the Game Developers Conference in 2019, when Google made its first big splash with Stadia. However, according to Wired, “it would be months until Google would actually hire the bulk of” the studio’s developers. Google’s goal was to hire 2,000 people over the course of five years to make Stadia games, Wired reported.When Stadia first launched, my colleague Sean Hollister said it was “still just a beta” right in the headline. And apparently, Stadia developers agreed: “Stadia employees shared the concern that the technology felt like a beta at launch,” according to Wired. Although Stadia worked — in that it could stream games from the cloud to a PC or phone — it was still missing many features that were shown off in its pre-launch marketing. Two sources also told Wired that Stadia “did not meet internal expectations in 2020.” That’s backed up by Bloomberg, which reported Google missed Stadia targets for “sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.”If you’ve been following Stadia, that may not be all that surprising — my colleague Tom Warren found Stadia to be a lonely place back in May — but it seems even promotions for free Stadia Premiere kits weren’t enough to help Google meet its goals for Stadia.Google also attempted to attract users to Stadia by making deals with publishers for ports of tentpole games like Red Dead Redemption 2 in the tens of millions of dollars, reports Bloomberg. And according to Jason Schreier, the author of the Bloomberg story, Google apparently spent tens of millions per port.Just to reiterate the absurdity of this thing: Sources say Google spent tens of millions of dollars -- the budgets of some major games -- PER Stadia port. Publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two were raking it inI highly encourage you to read both Wired and Bloomberg’s reports about Stadia’s struggles. For now, Stadia will continue to exist as a platform, even though Google won’t be making games for it. In a blog about the studio closures, Harrison also said that Google has an “increased focus on using our technology platform for industry partners,” which could suggest that Google may offer Stadia as a white-label cloud gaming service to other companies. But with studio closures and these two reports, it’s hard not to feel that the writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia.A newsletter about computers"
378,Analysis finds bots did hyped GameStop on major social media,Social Media,https://nypost.com/2021/02/26/bots-hyped-gamestop-on-major-social-media-platforms-analysis/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.

Bots on major social media platforms have been hyping up GameStop and other “meme” stocks, according to an analysis by Massachusetts-based cybersecurity company PiiQ Media, suggesting organized economic or foreign actors may have played a role in the Reddit-driven trading frenzy.Shares in GameStop soared last month after Reddit users banded together to squeeze hedge funds that had bet against the video game retailer and other companies. Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman told Congress this month that bots, artificial or fake accounts with automated content, had not played a “significant role” in GameStop Reddit message traffic.PiiQ Media’s analysis of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube posts, however, found that bots used the platforms to push GameStop and other “meme” stocks, although it is unclear how influential they were in the overall saga.A startup that focuses on social media risks, PiiQ said it examined patterns of keywords such as “Hold the Line” and GameStop’s stock symbol, “GME” across conversations and profiles prior to the Jan. 28 frenzy, through Feb. 18. For comparison, it also assessed posts on an unrelated set of stocks.PiiQ said that it identified very similar daily “start and stop patterns” in the GameStop-related posts, with activity starting at the beginning of the trading day, followed by a large spike at the end of the trading day. Such patterns are indicative of bots, said Aaron Barr, co-founder and chief technology officer of PiiQ.“We saw clear patterns of artificial behavior across the other four social media platforms. When you think of organic content, it’s variable in the day, variable day-to-day. It doesn’t have the exact same pattern every day for a month,” he said.Based on its authenticity scoring system, PiiQ estimates there are tens of thousands of bot accounts hyping GameStop, the meme stocks, and Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency swept up in the frenzy. Thousands of fake accounts can be purchased for as little as $200, it said.The company did not analyze Reddit data, but Barr said he would expect to see a similar pattern of activity on Reddit, indicating bot-like or coordinated management of conversations.A representative for Reddit did not comment beyond Huffman’s testimony. Representatives for YouTube, Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary did not respond to requests for comment. The social media platforms generally try to weed out harmful bots, said Barr.A spokesperson for Twitter said that “bots” had become a catch-all term that can often mischaracterize the nature of the account. The company notes bots can be used on its platform for creative or innovative purposes.The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing the GameStop saga, and this month suspended trading in a handful of companies because some “social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence” their stocks.In addition to traders, organized criminals may use social media to stoke asset prices, and undermining the integrity of U.S. markets is a known goal of hostile state actors, said Barr. But it is unclear how successful, if at all, these types of influence efforts are, he said.“Measuring the effect of those campaigns is often illusive.”

Facebook is pushing back on new Apple privacy rules for its mobile devices, this time saying the social media giant is standing up for small businesses in television and radio advertisements and full page newspaper ads.Two titans of Silicon Valley, Facebook and Apple, are in a bitter fight that centers on the iPhone data of millions of people and whether companies should be able to track that data as easily as they do now.Facebook believes the answer is yes. On Wednesday, it even unveiled a video voiced by Grace Jones aimed at currying the public's favor.Apple says not so fast. CEO Tim Cook tweeted last month about the need for greater control over data privacy ""from safeguarding your health & financial data to guarding against algorithms that perpetuate rampant misinformation. We need transparency and reform.""What will happen?In the coming weeks, Apple will update its iOS software for iPhones to require apps to get explicit consent to track what people are doing on their phones for the purposes of sharing it with third parties.This type of tracking — which includes which apps are being used and for how long, which websites are visited, and data about a user's location — is tapped by advertisers to create hypertargeted, personalized advertisements.According to Apple, the average app has at least six trackers that are discreetly harvesting user data.Some apps, like Facebook, allow for some data tracking to be manually disabled. But by default, it is turned on. That gives the company reams of personal data on who we are and what we are doing, which it then vacuums up, packages and uses to sell ads.Starting sometime early this spring, Apple will require apps to send a push alert where people can either choose to ""ask app not to track"" or ""allow.""We believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it’s used. Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before, App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 will just require that they ask for your permission first. pic.twitter.com/UnnAONZ61IWhy does Facebook oppose Apple's update? While Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the move is about giving people more control over data collection practices he sees as intrusive, Facebook officials argue Apple is acting out of self-interest.Facebook says Apple is attempting to push free apps, which often sweep data up and feed it to advertisers, to move to subscription models. Apple, through its App Store, collects a 30% cut of in-app purchases, which critics dub ""the Apple tax."" In an interview with NPR, Facebook's director of privacy and public policy Steve Satterfield said Apple's forthcoming alert is an attempt to undercut the business model used by Facebook and other ad-supported free apps.""This discouragement, this is going to have a real impact on the Internet as we know it, which is increasingly going to move to a paid experience, which again, benefits Apple's bottom line,"" Satterfield said.Facebook has also launched a website and taken out full-page advertisements in newspapers, in addition to a recent TV and radio ad push, to put a spotlight on how many small business owners depend on targeted ads.The tech giant points to people like Monique Wilsondebriano. She launched the Charleston Gourmet Burger company in South Carolina. When she first started, she could not afford TV or radio ads. But she was able to drum up interest on Facebook. ""Ninety percent of our customers are finding us because of Facebook, because of those personalized ads, so if something was to disrupt that, it's going to be a problem,"" she told NPR.This perspective was so important to Facebook that officials invited Wilsondebriano and other small business owners to speak at a recent company press briefing. Yet privacy advocates and other prominent Facebook critics have raised doubts about whether the change will indeed significantly impact small business as much as profits at Facebook, which generates some 98% of its revenue from advertising. A recent study from the group TapResearch found that 55% of people surveyed said they would not let Facebook track them across apps if they were prompted. Some analysts predict Apple's update could result in a 7% hit to Facebook's revenue.It is personal between Cook and Zuckerberg In remarks delivered in late January at a technology and privacy conference in Brussels, Cook underscored Apple's emphasis on data privacy. ""It seems no piece of information is too private or personal to be surveilled, monetized and aggregated into a 360-degree view of your life,"" Cook said. Cook never mentioned Facebook by name, but in discussing a tech company's business model run amok, his target was clear. ""At a moment of rampant disinformation, and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement,"" said Cook, speaking just weeks after the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol. Back in 2018, Zuckerberg condemned Cook's comments criticizing Facebook turning users into the product as ""extremely glib"" and ""not at all aligned with the truth."" According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg at the time said this privately to his team about Cook's jabs against Facebook: ""We need to inflict pain."" Facebook and Apple: Opposite ways of making moneyBoth Silicon Valley giants, the companies' ways of making money and views of Internet are directly in conflict.Zuckerberg has long said the only way to build a social network that connects billions of people is for the platform to be free to use and supported by advertising. It is often said that when a tech service is ""free,"" users pay mightily with their data. And that is the case with Facebook, which compiles its own portrait of its users through granular behavior tracking and also has a lucrative business of selling data to third-parties, like data brokers and advertisers. Cook, meanwhile, is mostly in the hardware business. Apple makes most of its cash by selling iPhones, iPads and laptops. While Apple has apps that do a fair share of data mining, Apple claims it does not share that data with third parties. No doubt Apple's upcoming software update helps its image as a privacy protector. It is not lost on Cook that the message has proven especially resonant at a time when lawmakers and prosecutors seem ready to rein in the power of Big Tech, while other critics of Silicon Valley gain bipartisan support for rallying against the excesses of the industry.""We have an application like Facebook that's really driven by collecting data, and harnessing the value of that data,"" said Jordan Fischer, a law professor at Drexel University who follows privacy issues. ""And then we have Apple which is almost becoming this gatekeeper function for applications and saying we're going to mandate a certain minimum level of privacy, and they're clashing because they don't necessary work in the same world."" Analyst Dan Ives said this Facebook-Apple row is setting the stage for a larger fight over how technology companies will balance privacy with data collection in the digital economy.""I think Facebook is worrying about, 'This is just a first step for Apple. What could be in the next one to two years if they further put the clamps down around data privacy as well as advertising?' "" he said. ""Apple knows in this regulatory environment, not being flexible on privacy is ultimately going to be come down on their side.""Editor's note: Apple and Facebook are among NPR's financial supporters.

380,What Facebook's Australia news ban could mean for its future in the US,Politics,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/27/facebook-australia-news-ban-us-legislation,"The company’s clash with Australia’s government has left clues as to how US legislation might rein in its vast influenceLast modified on Sat 27 Feb 2021 11.03 GMTFacebook’s dramatic decision last week to block news from being shared to its users in Australia is already seeing global legislative aftershocks and may present new challenges for the company in the US.Facebook in mid-February banned Australian news organizations from posting content on the platform and barred users based in Australia from linking to news articles from Australian and international outlets. The move came in response to proposed legislation in the country that would require platforms to pay publishers if news content was posted on their sites.Facebook has since struck a deal with the Australian government for more flexibility. But the tech giant’s show of force has added fuel to the growing demands to rein in its vast influence in the US, and has left clues as to what legislation similar to the Australian proposal could look like in the United States. “With a desire among politicians on both sides of the aisle to think more seriously about regulating social media companies, it is clear that changes are in the cards for Facebook,” said Josh Pasek, an associate professor of communications and political science at the University of Michigan.Facebook already faced unprecedented scrutiny in 2020. Company representatives, including Mark Zuckerberg, were called to testify in front of Congress several times over antitrust concerns, including over its acquisition of Instagram, its dominance in the social media space, and its influence in advertising. Investigations examining the impact of Facebook and Google’s advertising dominance continue at state and federal levels.When it comes to legislation addressing the unchecked power of big tech, the question is not if but when it will come, said Bruce Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. Facebook’s forceful approach in Australia would only raise the pressure for action, he said.“Thanks to its extreme heavy-handedness in Australia, all eyes are now on Facebook,” Wolpe said. “It really made an extreme tactical mistake in shutting down something of such fundamental importance to the public interest.”The incident has already made its way to the US Congress. In antitrust discussions on Thursday, it was cited by Representative David Cicilline as a reflection of Facebook’s outsized power over publishers, underscoring heightened interest in the issue and potential legislation on the horizon.New legislation on news publisher rights on Facebook would probably mirror a bill previously introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, according to the news site Axios. The measure, co-sponsored by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, would allow newspapers to collectively bargain with dominant online platforms.Facebook may have thought it could afford a policy gamble in Australia, a country that represents one of the company’s smaller markets, Wolpe said. But the company has 223m users in the US, and the country is home to much of its workforce, making it unlikely the company would attempt similarly drastic tactics against US legislators. With this in mind, Pasek said Facebook would probably enact its own policies on payment for content in an attempt to stave off legislative action. The company has been paying some publishers millions of dollars for content since 2019 and expanded the partnership program to the UK in January of 2021.As this policy expands, so will debates about which firms should be paid for content. The code in Australia that sparked the decision to remove news declares that publishers making $150,000 per year or more can sign up to be paid for content. This would encompass many small newspapers and online publishers but stands to most benefit large companies like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. In the US, the media market is much more varied and complex.“It is likely Facebook will try to get ahead of this kind of legislation so it is not caught off guard,” Pasek said. “This is going to get messier as time goes on.”"

Thankfully, a resolution bump appears to be in order. Windows Central and The Verge both say Microsoft is testing 1080p streams. It's not certain how widespread the testing is or how soon you'll see that upgrade, but this would be a huge boost in quality for big screen gamers.A simultaneous leak of an updated Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows also shows how the software will accommodate more players. It'll reportedly offer support for touch and gyro (motion) input, making it more feasible to remotely play Xbox games on tablets like the Surface line when you don't have a gamepad.Both the 1080p test and the new app are early, and it's not certain when either might show up. Microsoft is rumored to have a gaming event lined up for March, but there's no guarantee either upgrade will be ready to go at that time. It's easy to see Microsoft pushing forward, though. Cloud gaming and remote play work best when you don't have to worry about your device choices or image quality — they wouldn't quite be ubiquitous after this, but they'd be close enough that more people might give them a try.scoop: here's a look at Microsoft's unreleased xCloud app for Windows.

382,What Is Thunderbolt 4? Why This New Interface Will Matter in PCs in 2021,Hardware,https://uk.pcmag.com/components/131257/what-is-thunderbolt-4-why-this-new-interface-will-matter-in-pcs-in-2021,"

    For anyone who has used a Mac laptop in recent years, or a top-end Windows notebook, Thunderbolt 3 has probably been on their radar—and perhaps had them scratching their heads regarding what it can do. This port looks like one of the new-style, oval USB Type-C connectors, but it does a bunch more: It can carry a video signal using the DisplayPort protocol, charge connected devices, and allow for data transfers at speeds beyond what simple USB can manage. (See our explainer, Thunderbolt 3 vs. USB-C: What's the Difference?) The story of the latest flavor of the Thunderbolt interface—Thunderbolt 4—starts with a change in direction, however. Intel opened up the Thunderbolt 3 protocol to USB's controlling consortium (the USB-IF) for royalty-free use in the development of next-generation USB4, delivering faster speeds and interoperability to USB4 devices. Indeed, the fates and directions of the two new ""4"" specs are intertwined. (And yes, the USB team dropped the space in ""USB4."" That's not a typo.)This move toward open source didn’t mean, however, that Intel stopped developing its traditionally proprietary Thunderbolt specification. Intel has kept moving Thunderbolt down the tracks and announced Thunderbolt 4 a year ago at CES 2020, and new Thunderbolt 4-equipped PCs based on Intel’s 11th Generation (“Tiger Lake”) Core processors are just now starting to roll out. These Tiger Lake-based computers are also ushering in USB4 connectivity, so there is bound to be some confusion with Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 both arriving at the same time...and sometimes, on the same actual ports.Also muddling up the picture is Thunderbolt 4’s lack of a single headline-grabbing feature—such as a faster top-end speed than its predecessor. Thunderbolt 4 isn't a speed play; it is more about minimum requirements than maximum speeds. To help you sort out how Thunderbolt 4 differs from Thunderbolt 3, as well as from USB4, we've prepared a little primer on the state of play.Before we get into the specifics of the new Thunderbolt 4 protocol, let’s first back up and explain what Thunderbolt is and does, and how we got here.Introduced by Intel and Apple, Thunderbolt first showed up on a MacBook Pro in 2011. The physical form of the port was a mini DisplayPort connector with a little lightning-strike icon next to it. It combined DisplayPort and PCI Express technologies in a single cable to drive high-resolution displays and high-speed data transfers with a top speed of 10Gbps. Using the same physical port, Thunderbolt 2 doubled the bandwidth to 20Gbps and added DisplayPort 1.2 support, giving the interface the ability to drive a video signal to a 4K display. Thunderbolt 3 doubled the data rate—again—to 40Gbps. Another big change: Thunderbolt 3 no longer used the mini DisplayPort connector as its physical interface, dropping it in favor of the USB Type-C port, with the technology piggybacking on that connector, in the same way that Thunderbolt 1 and 2 piggybacked on mini DisplayPort. It also added up to 100 watts of power via USB Power Delivery (USB PD), so you could use your PC to charge your phone and other USB devices—or even charge a laptop over the port. The Thunderbolt 3 spec also introduced Thunderbolt networking with 10Gbps Ethernet. Thunderbolt 3 provided enough video bandwidth that it led to a wide array of applications, from single-cable docks that could also charge your devices, to external GPUs to supercharge a laptop’s graphics capabilities.Thunderbolt 4 doesn’t offer any headline-grabbing improvements over Thunderbolt 3. On the surface, the two protocols appear very similar. Both use the USB Type-C physical connector. Both offer a maximum throughput of 40Gbps. Both offer at least 15 watts and up to 100 watts of charging power. And both offer support for that 10Gbps networking. Underneath the surface, however, Thunderbolt 4 has a number of significant advantages. For starters, it doubles the minimum video and data requirements of Thunderbolt 3. Thunderbolt 4 will support sending a video signal to two 4K displays, or to one 8K display, where Thunderbolt 3 is required to support only a single 4K display. And where Thunderbolt 3 systems have to support only a 16Gbps data rate via PCI Express, Thunderbolt 4 will double that requirement to 32Gbps. That added bandwidth will certainly be put to good use by anyone who regularly transfers gigantic files of high-resolution video and other large data sets from storage drives to their PC for editing.Thunderbolt 4 will also lead to more capable peripherals. You’ll see Thunderbolt 4 docks and monitors with four Thunderbolt 4 ports, double the two ports, at most, you’ll find on Thunderbolt 3 devices. New thin-and-light laptops that need less than 100 watts to charge will be required to offer USB Type-C charging on at least one of their Thunderbolt 4 ports. And when a Thunderbolt 4 laptop is connected to a Thunderbolt 4 dock, it must be able to wake from sleep from a connected keyboard or mouse. Thunderbolt 4 cables will also support 40Gbps throughput at up to two meters in length, up from the 0.5-meter maximum of a passive Thunderbolt 3 cable. With the ability to daisy-chain up to six Thunderbolt devices, you have the ability to connect multiple devices without each one needing a direct connection to your computer. Combined with Thunderbolt 4’s greater charging and wake-from-sleep capabilities and longer cables, you’ll have more flexibility in setting up your workspace to make your office less cluttered with wires and your office life a bit easier.Now, in practical fact, it’s easy to confuse Thunderbolt 4 and USB4. They both use the USB Type-C connector. They both offer a maximum bandwidth of 40Gbps. They are both getting introduced with Intel’s new 11th Generation “Tiger Lake” Core processors. And Thunderbolt 4 supports USB4, meaning you can connect a USB device to your laptop’s Thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt 4 is also backward compatible with Thunderbolt 3. In both instances, however, the connection will default to the slower speeds of USB4 or Thunderbolt 3.Thunderbolt 4 is basically a guarantee that you are getting the best version of USB4. While USB4 offers the same 40Gbps speed as Thunderbolt 4, there is also a slower 20Gbps version of USB4. Thunderbolt 4 also guarantees you can run a pair of 4K displays at minimum and transfer data at up to 32Gbps. With USB4, you are guaranteed only the minimums of running a single display and a 16Gbps data rate. A USB4 hub also lacks the mandatory charging and wake-from-sleep requirements of Thunderbolt 4, as well as 10Gbps networking. USB4 does have one advantage over Thunderbolt 4: logos that are more informative. With USB4, you should see ""USB 20Gbps"" and ""USB 40Gbps"" logos next to USB Type-C ports that will tell which flavor of USB4 you are dealing with. Unfortunately, Intel does not offer such specifics with its Thunderbolt logos. A Thunderbolt logo is a Thunderbolt logo is a lightning bolt, with no way to tell just by glancing at the side of your laptop or your desktop PC's I/O panel whether a port is version 1, 2, 3, or 4 of Thunderbolt. (The connector will tell you if it is Thunderbolt 1 or 2 versus Thunderbolt 3 or 4, but that's all you can assume on sight.) You’ll need to consult your user manual or spec sheet to know which version of Thunderbolt a device offers. (Some Thunderbolt 4 cables might include a “4” next to the Thunderbolt 4 logo, but such specificity is not usually offered on laptops.)One last advantage that Thunderbolt 4 offers over Thunderbolt 3 is better security against Thunderspy attacks. In such a potential attack, a hacker can steal your data via vulnerabilities of a Thunderbolt port. Such an attack requires physical access to your device, but it takes all of five minutes and is effective even when your laptop is locked or sleeping, or your hard drive is encrypted.A Thunderspy attack is able to work by taking advantage of the PCI Express portion of Thunderbolt and its direct memory access (DMA), which bypasses the CPU to enable fast access to system memory. Thunderbolt 4 requires Intel’s Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d), which protects against DMA attacks. How this works: VT-d offers DMA remapping, which isolates a portion of system memory for a connected device, so that the device cannot read or write to other areas of your memory. It basically walls off a portion of system memory for a Thunderbolt device, so it can’t access other places in the memory to overwrite, say, your device’s password protection. To be sure, this vulnerability is a very remote threat for most folks. It's mainly a concern for corporate laptops that may travel a lot, get left in unsecured locations, and contain extremely sensitive financial or other business data. Thunderbolt 4 laptops based on Intel’s 11th Generation “Tiger Lake” Core processors are only now starting to roll out. We saw the first Tiger Lake laptops with Thunderbolt 4 support last fall in the latest versions of the Asus ZenBook 13 (UX325EA) and the Dell XPS 13 (9310). More are sure to follow, but not every Tiger Lake laptop with USB-C ports will offer Thunderbolt 4 support. Look at the spec sheets carefully, as well as for the Thunderbolt logo, because without it you are likely staring at a vanilla USB4 port, which offers previous-generation Thunderbolt 3 capabilities.Apple’s new M1 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were released near the end of 2020, and while these new systems feature USB4 ports, they do not offer formal Thunderbolt 4 support (just Thunderbolt 3). It remains to be seen when the first Mac with Thunderbolt 4 will arrive, and whether it’ll show up on a Mac with Apple’s own M1 silicon or a Mac based on Intel Tiger Lake CPUs.On the peripheral side of the fence, the very first Thunderbolt 4 docks were starting to hit the market with announcements at CES 2021 (see this example from Kensington and another from OWC), while hubs, external drives, external GPUs, and displays seem imminent. You can be certain they will start rolling out later this year as more PCs and laptops with Thunderbolt 4 are released. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking."

The U.S. Air Force’s top general said the service is committed to the F-35 stealth fighter following comments and headlines in the past week that suggested the demise of the aircraft may be near.  Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown said on Thursday the U.S. could end up buying fewer than the 1,700-plus jets it envisioned when the project began more than two decades ago, but rejected recent high-profile reporting portraying the aircraft as a failure.Pentagon officials are currently reviewing the mix of manned combat jets and drones needed to win a war 15 years from now, Brown said. That study is looking at not only the number and types of manned aircraft, but also drones that the Air Force wants to team with fighter jets in the coming years.“What I've asked the team to do is … provide me options on how to take a look at this because I want to make sure we have the right capability,” Brown said during an online press conference during a virtual conference hosted by the Air Force Association. Among the options, Brown said, is continuing to buy 1,763 jets. But that number came out of a May 1997 Pentagon strategy review and has not changed since.Brown sparked some alarm when he first discussed the tactical aircraft review with reporters last week, In that meeting, the general raised the possibility of buying a newly-designed fighter jet to replace old F-16 fighters — a job the F-35 is supposed to be filling.""I want to be able to build something new and different that's not the F-16, that has some of those capabilities, but gets there faster and features a digital approach,"" Brown said at the time.Some viewed Brown’s comments as confirmation that the service is abandoning the F-35, a plane that has taken nearly two decades to build and, although already seeing combat and being delivered to allies overseas, still faces developmental hurdles before the Pentagon considers it is fully combat ready. “The U.S. Air Force Just Admitted the F-35 Stealth Fighter Has Failed,” read a Forbes headline on Tuesday. NBC News anchor Brian Williams said “the Pentagon may scrap the F-35 program” in a nearly three-minute report on MSNBC this week. Brown, when asked Thursday if the F-35 program is a failure, said that is “nowhere near” the case.“The F-35 is a cornerstone of our [tactical aircraft] capability and for our fighter capability,” he  said.U.S. and allied F-35s have already seen combat. The U.S. military has deployed the stealth jets to Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. This week, Air Force leaders said they are experimenting with new ways to deploy the jets from separate airfields in the Pacific. The latest round of questions about the F-35’s future arose in September when the Air Force revealed it had secretly built and flown a new type of combat aircraft called the Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD.“As far as NGAD versus F-35, we’re not going to take money from the F-35 to [fund] the NGAD,” Brown said. But, Brown said the Air Force will look to take money from “other parts of the fighter force” to “help fund” the NGAD project.The F-35 price tag has declined significantly in recent years, but the program still faces a $12 billion bill to develop updated hardware and software. At the same time, the Pentagon and F-35 maker Lockheed Martin are in the midst of negotiating a five-year maintenance contract for the hundreds of jets already in the military arsenal.“We're gonna do our best to make sure ... that we are this airpower solution for Gen. Brown in terms of capability and affordability, so that we can tackle not only today's threat, but more importantly, the threat of the future,” Bruce Litchfield, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics sustainment vice president, said during a Tuesday press briefing.

387,Minneapolis to pay social media influencers to fight misinformation during trial of officers charged with killing George Floyd,Social Media,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/02/26/minneapolis-pay-influencers-fight-misinformation-police-officers-trial-george-floyd-black-lives-matter/,"
			Trending:		The city of Minneapolis plans to pay social media influencers to spread city-approved messages as part of an effort to combat misinformation during the upcoming trials of the four police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd, officials said.Under the program, which the Minneapolis City Council approved Friday, the city will enter into contracts with six social media influencers who will be paid $2,000 each to share “city-generated and approved messages” with the African American, Native American, East African, Hmong and Latino communities, officials said.The program, reported by The Minnesota Reformer on Friday, represents a novel use of social media influencers, who have been paid for years to sell products like cosmetics and beach vacations. In this case, the social media influencers will attempt to fight misinformation online, where rumors can spread quickly, inflaming tensions.It is part of what the city calls a Joint Information System intended to create multiple channels on the ground and online to share “timely and relevant information” with the public throughout the trials. The program will involve partnerships with community groups and Black-led media as well as ethnic radio stations, officials said.“The goal is to increase access to information to communities that do not typically follow mainstream news sources or city communications channels,” or who do not get their news in English, Sarah McKenzie, a city spokeswoman, said in an email. “It’s also an opportunity to create more two-way communication between the city and communities.”But the program is likely to encounter deep skepticism from residents who don’t trust the city to relay truthful information about the trials of its former officers. The Minneapolis Police Department has a long history of accusations of abuse.“It’s just really hard believing they will be truthful, given how they have treated our families in the past,” said Toshira Garraway, of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, a support group for the families of those killed by the police in Minnesota. “We don’t know if we’re actually getting and receiving the truth. The state of Minnesota has broken the trust of the communities within this state.”Michelle Gross, the president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, a volunteer police accountability organization, said the program seemed intended to manipulate the views of residents and activists.“I don’t think this is about dismantling falsities,” she said. “I think this is about crafting a narrative and controlling it. And I think people will see through this, frankly.”The program was approved as Minneapolis prepares for the trial next month of Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer who was seen on video kneeling for more than nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a Black man, as he begged for his life.Floyd’s death in May touched off global protests against police brutality, some of which led to scenes of chaos in Minneapolis, with buildings burned and officers using tear gas and firing rubber bullets into crowds.Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jury selection is expected to begin March 8. Three other former officers who were with Chauvin during Floyd’s final minutes are scheduled to face trial on aiding and abetting charges in August.The social media influencers will amplify the city’s social media posts by sharing them with their followers, officials said.Minneapolis officials want to make sure that “we get the word out about what’s happening with the trials and what the options are for community to engage, and particularly communities who are not utilizing, maybe, the city’s website or the other traditional media sources,” Mark Ruff, the Minneapolis city coordinator, told the City Council on Friday.Lisa Bender, the City Council president, noted that the trial would be livestreamed and said that community groups had already started to inform residents about the trial process.“This is, I think, the city acknowledging that a lot of that work is going unpaid, and that the city should step up and provide resources to help fund that,” she told the Council. “I think, also, when we’re communicating about this, we need to acknowledge the harm that was caused by the city in the first place, from George Floyd’s death, from actions by our Police Department that followed.”She acknowledged that “not everyone in our community trusts the city as a communicator.”Despite the skepticism of many residents, Nicole A. Cooke, an associate professor at the School of Information Science at the University of South Carolina, said the program had “great potential, if it’s done the right way.”People are more likely to believe information if it is coming from a trusted source, she said, be it a pastor or someone they follow on TikTok. “If I have a relationship with you and I trust you, I am more willing and apt to trust the information you give me,” she said.The model is part of a long-held tradition of leaders “going to whoever is most respected in the community, particularly when there are language issues,” Cooke said. “So it is absolutely wise to tap those people to send out trusted messages.”But if the city does not enlist the right social media influencers, “this could backfire,” Cooke said.“The perception of who the city thinks are social influencers and who the community thinks are social influencers could be different,” she said.Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist in Minneapolis, said it was critical that the city clearly label any messages that it relays through paid social media influencers.“I’m definitely not trusting a random person that pops up and tries to tell me this is what the city is doing and saying,” she said. “I think most of us won’t be fooled if those messages come forward.”Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"

389,"Bill Allowing Big Tech To Form ""Techno-Governments"" To Be Announced Today - The Debrief",Politics,https://thedebrief.org/bill-allowing-big-tech-to-form-techno-governments-to-be-announced-today/,"Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak will be announcing legislation today that will allow major technology companies to effectively form techno-governments. Gov. Sisolak first mentioned the proposal of creating “Innovation Zones” in Nevada during his State-of-the-State address on January 19. “New companies creating groundbreaking technologies can come to Nevada to develop their industries. This will be done without tax abatements or public financing.” While the legislation wouldn’t provide subsidiaries or public funding, according to a draft of the Bill obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, major technology firms would be granted authority to form their independent techno-governments within Nevada. “[They] would carry the same authority as a county, including the ability to impose taxes, form school districts and justice courts and provide government services, to name a few duties,” Las Vegas Review-Journal reports.  During his remarks in January, Gov. Sisolak specifically mentioned the company Blockchains, LLC as already being committed to creating a techno-government in the state that would “fully run on blockchain technology.” Gov. Sisolak said the move would make Nevada “the epicenter of this emerging industry and creating the high paying jobs and revenue that go with it.” In the simplest terms, blockchain is a type of database system that stores computational information in groups, known as “blocks.” Though not entirely unalterable, blockchain technology is considered secure by design because data transactions between parties are recorded efficiently and in an open, verifiable, and permanent manner. Financial services, particularly cryptocurrencies, widely use blockchain technology. The company mentioned explicitly by Gov. Sisolak, Blockchains, LLC, was founded in 2014 by consumer protection attorney and cryptocurrency millionaire Jeffrey Berns. According to their website, Blockchains, LLC currently owns over 67,000 acres in Storey County, Nevada. The company says they aim to convert this land into “the most advanced ‘high-tech’ community and society for business and residents in the country.” Calling it “a new way to live,” Blockchains says they “believe the integration of our product suite is where the full potential of a smart community, digital economy, and connected society can be realized.” “Blockchains aims to showcase how business development, residential living, and commerce can flourish alongside world-changing technologies. To do that, we have to start with a blank slate – otherwise, we’d merely be trying to insert smart technologies into devices that aren’t, well, ‘smart,'” reads the company’s “Road to Development” plan.According to state records, in 2018, Blockchains purchased 67,125 acres of uninhabited land at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center for $170 million. At the time, the company’s website did not list any executive, a phone number, or a clear explanation of what it’s software did, leading some local media outlets to label the company as “mysterious.” Since the land grab, Blockchains has been lobbying hard to get legislation passed that would allow the company to form its own techno-government. Las Vegas Review-Journal reports Blockchains, LLC gave $50,000 to a political action committee, Home Means Nevada, which managed Sisolak’s transition into office in January 2019. Campaign finance records also show the company donated $10,000 to Sisolak and his Republican opponent Adam Laxalt’s campaign in 2018. Records also show the company’s owner, Jeffrey Berns, personally gave $50,000 to the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019 and various donations ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 to various state lawmakers from both parties. Over a week ago, The Debrief reached out to Blockchains, LLC for comment; however, the company did not respond to this request.   In an email to The Debrief, Communications Director for the Governor’s office, Meghin Delaney, said Gov. Sisolack will formally unveil the proposed “Innovation Zones” legislation during a virtual press conference today, Friday, February 26, at 4:30 pm (EST). Joining Gov. Sisolack at today’s conference will be Michael Brown, Executive Director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, and Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the draft language in the proposal said the traditional local government model was “inadequate alone to provide the flexibility and resources conducive to making the State a leader in attracting and retaining new forms and types of businesses and fostering economic development in emerging technologies and innovative industries.”The draft proposal also reportedly said the creation of techno-governments or “alternative forms of local government” were needed to aid economic development within the state. The Governor’s Office of Economic Development is slated to handle applications for the Innovation Zones, which would be limited to specific “innovative technologies,” including “blockchain, autonomous technology, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, wireless technology, biometrics, and renewable resource technology.” The Governor’s Office of Economic Development redirected The Debrief’s questions on the legislation backing techno-governments to the Governor’s communications staff; since the Bill had not been formally proposed, much less passed. The draft proposal laid out the requirements for companies to create their own techno-government, including an applicant owning at least 50,000 acres of undeveloped and uninhabited land, all within a single county but separate from any city, town or tax increment area.Big Tech companies would also have to pledge at least $250 million toward initial development, with a plan to invest an additional $1 billion over ten years in the zone. Major technology companies would function as their own independent governmental body, with a three-member board of supervisors that would carry the same authority as a board of county commissioners. The Bill’s proposed draft suggests technology companies would have a significant say over who would sit on techno-government’s board. While the draft proposal provides insight into some of the details behind the concept, some aspects could be changed when the Bill is formally introduced.  Aside from lobbying by companies such as Blockchains, the primary motivation for proposing the allowance of techno-governments would be the hope that the move would significantly boost Nevada’s beleaguered economy. With tourism indirectly or directly accounting for almost 25% of the state’s economy, Nevada has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Las Vegas, the United States’ second-largest municipal tourism industry, accounted for over $19 billion of Nevada’s GDP before the pandemic. According to the Nevada Resort Association, tourism and leisure services account for one out of every three jobs in Nevada. The Brookings Institute found two Nevada cities, Las Vegas and Reno, were among the top three metro economies hardest-hit by the pandemic. In December 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Nevada’s unemployment rate of 9.2% was the second-highest in the United States. Hawaii, which came in dead last, was only a tenth of a percentage point below Nevada at 9.3%. Conversely, metropolitan hubs specializing in technology, such as Seattle and San Francisco, have thrived and benefited from COVID-19. Sales at non-store retailers (i.e., online shopping) increased by 15% from November 2019 to November 2020. Online retail giant Amazon, headquartered in Seattle, nearly doubled its workforce, adding 400,000 jobs in 2020. Social media monolith Facebook announced plans to hire an additional 10,000 workers in April 2020. The adage that “the most secure job is a federal government job” has held during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the U.S. Government grew by over 50,000 jobs in 2020. The metropolitan seat of America’s power, Washington D.C., saw a government employment rate increase over 2% last year. By allowing major technology corporations to form their techno-governments, Nevada will be trying to capture lightning in a bottle by enticing a mix of the most benefited industries during these economically downtrodden times. While economic benefits seem enticing, almost assuredly, there will be some public concerns over the idea of Big Tech being allowed to form its own sovereign governance. In a 2018 essay, technology analyst Jamie Bartlett warned technology monopolies posed a real threat to democracies. “Tech is just the latest vehicle for very rich people to use well-tested techniques of buying political influence, monopolistic behavior and avoiding regulation,” wrote Bartlett. Fear over the power Big Tech companies wield has only increased in the past two years. The public and politicians alike have expressed concerns over Big Tech companies’ potential to be a cultural hegemony, dominating public ideas and beliefs. The jury is still out as to the ultimate impact of allowing Big Tech to form techno-governments, provided that the proposed legislation passes. In the area Blockchains plans to build their “better way to live,” Storey County Commissioner Lance Gilman was a little hesitant toward the proposed legislation during an interview with the Las Vegas Journal Review. “[It’s] going to have an impact on Storey County, and the jury is still out on whether that will be positive or negative.”Join us on Twitter or Facebook to weigh in and share your thoughts on Big Tech being allowed to form Techno-Governments.

One of the unsung achievements of modern software development is the degree to which it has become componentized: not that long ago, when you wanted to write a piece of software you had to write pretty much the whole thing using whatever tools were provided by the language you were writing in, maybe with a few specialized libraries like OpenSSL. No longer. The combination of newer languages, Open Source development and easy-to-use package management systems like JavaScript’s npm or Rust’s Cargo/crates.io has revolutionized how people write software, making it standard practice to pull in third party libraries even for the simplest tasks; it’s not at all uncommon for programs to depend on hundreds or thousands of third party packages.While this new paradigm has revolutionized software development, it has also greatly increased the risk of supply chain attacks, in which an attacker compromises one of your dependencies and through that your software.[1] A famous example of this is provided by the 2018 compromise of the event-stream package to steal Bitcoin from people’s computers. The Register’s brief history provides a sense of the scale of the problem:Ayrton Sparling, a computer science student at California State University, Fullerton (FallingSnow on GitHub), flagged the problem last week in a GitHub issues post. According to Sparling, a commit to the event-stream module added flatmap-stream as a dependency, which then included injection code targeting another package, ps-tree.There are a number of ways in which an attacker might manage to inject malware into a package. In this case, what seems to have happened is that the original maintainer of event-stream was no longer working on it and someone else volunteered to take it over. Normally, that would be great, but here it seems that volunteer was malicious, so it’s not great.Recently, Eric Brewer, Rob Pike, Abhishek Arya, Anne Bertucio and Kim Lewandowski posted a proposal on the Google security blog for addressing vulnerabilities in Open Source software. They cover a number of issues including vulnerability management and security of compilation, and there’s a lot of good stuff here, but the part that has received the most attention is the suggestion that certain packages should be designated “critical”[2]:For software that is critical to security, we need to agree on development processes that ensure sufficient review, avoid unilateral changes, and transparently lead to well-defined, verifiable official versions.These are good development practices, and ones we follow here at Mozilla, so I certainly encourage people to adopt them. However, trying to require them for critical software seems like it will have some problems.One of the real benefits of this new model of software development is that it’s low friction: it’s easy to develop a library and make it available — you just write it put it up on a package repository like crates.io — and it’s easy to use those packages — you just add them to your build configuration. But then you’re successful and suddenly your package is widely used and gets deemed “critical” and now you have to put in place all kinds of new practices. It probably would be better if you did this, but what if you don’t? At this point your package is widely used — or it wouldn’t be critical — so what now?Even packages which are well maintained and have good development practices routinely have vulnerabilities. For example, Firefox recently released a new version that fixed a vulnerability in the popular ANGLE graphics engine, which is maintained by Google. Both Mozilla and Google follow the practices that this blog post recommends, but it’s just the case that people make mistakes. To (possibly mis)quote Steve Bellovin, “Software has bugs. Security-relevant software has security-relevant bugs”. So, while these practices are important to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, we know they can’t eliminate them.Of course this applies to inadvertant vulnerabilities, but what about malicious actors (though note that Brewer et al. observe that “Taking a step back, although supply-chain attacks are a risk, the vast majority of vulnerabilities are mundane and unintentional—honest errors made by well-intentioned developers.”)? It’s possible that some of their proposed changes (in particular forbidding anonymous authors) might have an impact here, but it’s really hard to see how this is actionable. What’s the standard for not being anonymous? That you have an e-mail address? A Web page? A DUNS number?[3] None of these seem particularly difficult for a dedicated attacker to fake and of course the more strict you make the requirements the more it’s a burden for the (vast majority) of legitimate developers.I do want to acknowledge at this point that Brewer et al. clearly state that multiple layers of protection needed and that it’s necessary to have robust mechanisms for handling vulnerability defenses. I agree with all that, I’m just less certain about this particular piece.Part of the difficulty here is that there are ways in which a piece of software can be “critical”:The vast majority of packages — widely used or not — fall into the second category: they do something important but that isn’t security critical. Unfortunately, because of the way that software is generally built, this doesn’t matter: even when software is built out of a pile of small components, when they’re packaged up into a single program, each component has all the privileges that that program has. So, for instance, suppose you include a component for doing statistical calculations: if that component is compromised nothing stops it from opening up files on your disk and stealing your passwords or Bitcoins or whatever. This is true whether the compromise is due to an inadvertant vulnerability or malware injected into the package: a problem in any component compromises the whole system.[4] Indeed, minor non-security components make attractive targets because they may not have had as much scrutiny as high profile security components.When looked at from this perspective, it’s clear that we have a technology problem: There’s no good reason for individual components to have this much power. Rather, they should only have the capabilities they need to do the job they are intended to to (the technical term is least privilege); it’s just that the software tools we have don’t do a good job of providing this property. This is a situation which has long been recognized in complicated pieces of software like Web browsers, which employ a technique called “process sandboxing” (pioneered by Chrome) in which the code that interacts with the Web site is run in its own “sandbox” and has limited abilities to interact with your computer. When it wants to do something that it’s not allowed to do, it talks to the main Web browser code and asks it to do it for it, thus allowing that code to enforce the rules without being exposed to vulnerabilities in the rest of the browser.Process sandboxing is an important and powerful tool, but it’s a heavyweight one; it’s not practical to separate out every subcomponent of a large program into its own process. The good news is that there are several recent technologies which do allow this kind of fine-grained sandboxing, both based on WebAssembly. For WebAssembly programs, nanoprocesses allow individual components to run in their own sandbox with component-specific access control lists. More recently, we have been experimenting with a technology called called RLBox developed by researchers at UCSD, UT Austin, and Stanford which allows regular programs such as Firefox to run sandboxed components. The basic idea behind both of these is the same: use static compilation techniques to ensure that the component is memory-safe (i.e., cannot reach outside of itself to touch other parts of the program) and then give it only the capabilities it needs to do its job.Techniques like this point the way to a scalable technical approach for protecting yourself from third party components: each component is isolated in its own sandbox and comes with a list of the capabilities that it needs (often called a manifest) with the compiler enforcing that it has no other capabilities (this is not too dissimilar from — but much more granular than — the permissions that mobile applications request). This makes the problem of including a new component much simpler because you can just look at the capabilities it requests, without needing verify that the code itself is behaving correctly.While powerful, sandboxing itself — whether of the traditional process or WebAssembly variety — isn’t enough, for two reasons. First, the APIs that we have to work with aren’t sufficiently fine-grained. Consider the case of a component which is designed to let you open and process files on the disk; this necessarily needs to be able to open files, but what stops it from reading your Bitcoins instead of the files that the programmer wanted it to read? It might be possible to create a capability list that includes just reading certain files, but that’s not the API the operating system gives you, so now we need to invent something. There are a lot of cases like this, so things get complicated.The second reason is that some components are critical because they perform critical functions. For instance, no matter how much you sandbox OpenSSL, you still have to worry about the fact that it’s handling your sensitive data, and so if compromised it might leak that. Fortunately, this class of critical components is smaller, but it’s non-zero.This isn’t to say that sandboxing isn’t useful, merely that it’s insufficient. What we need is multiple layers of protection[5], with the first layer being procedural mechanisms to defend against code being compromised and the second layer being fine-grained sandboxing to contain the impact of compromise. As noted earlier, it seems problematic to put the burden of better processes on the developer of the component, especially when there are a large number of dependent projects, many of them very well funded.Something we have been looking at internally at Mozilla is a way for those projects to tag the dependencies they use and depend on. The way that this would work is that each project would then be tagged with a set of other projects which used it (e.g., “Firefox uses this crate”). Then when you are considering using a component you could look to see who else uses it, which gives you some measure of confidence. Of course, you don’t know what sort of auditing those organizations do, but if you know that Project X is very security conscious and they use component Y, that should give you some level of confidence. This is really just a automating something that already happens informally: people judge components by who else uses them. There are some obvious extensions here, for instance labelling specific versions, having indications of what kind of auditing the depending project did, or allowing people to configure their build systems to automatically trust projects vouched for by some set of other projects and refuse to include unvouched projects, maintaining a database of insecure versions (this is something the Brewer et al. proposal suggests too). The advantage of this kind of approach is that it puts the burden on the people benefitting from a project, rather than having some widely used project suddenly subject to a whole pile of new requirements which they may not be interested in meeting. This work is still in the exploratory stages, so reach out to me if you’re interested.Obviously, this only works if people actually do some kind of due diligence prior to depending on a component. Here at Mozilla, we do that to some extent, though it’s not really practical to review every line of code in a giant package like WebRTC There is some hope here as well: because modern languages such as Rust or Go are memory safe, it’s much easier to convince yourself that certain behaviors are impossible — even if the program has a defect — which makes it easier to audit.[6] Here too it’s possible to have clear manifests that describe what capabilities the program needs and verify (after some work) that those are accurate.As I said at the beginning, Brewer et al. are definitely right to be worried about this kind of attack. It’s very convenient to be able to build on other people’s work, but the difficulty of ascertaining the quality of that work is an enormous problem[7]. Fortunately, we’re seeing a whole series of technological advancements that point the way to a solution without having to go back to the bad old days of writing everything yourself.

391,"Away From Silicon Valley, the Military Is the Ideal Customer",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/technology/anduril-military-palmer-luckey.html,"While much has been made of tech’s unwillingness to work with the Pentagon, start-ups are still plumbing the industry’s decades-long ties to the military.Credit...By Philip CheungSupported byBy Cade MetzTo hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — Over the rolling, scrub-spotted hills of the Southern California coast, where defense contractors once tested rockets and lasers for President Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” missile defense program, what looked like a big, mechanical insect stalked a white pickup truck.Half a mile away, 28-year-old Palmer Luckey, one of the tech industry’s proudest iconoclasts, talked excitedly about the military potential of the flying machine — a self-piloting drone, called Ghost, that his start-up company Anduril built.“You can just set it up and then go do something else while it maneuvers,” he said.Though parts of Silicon Valley have kept the Pentagon at arm’s length in recent years, Mr. Luckey’s company, based 400 miles to the south in Irvine, is aggressively courting business from government agencies and the military.It is one of a number of young tech companies, many of them far from Silicon Valley, that are shrugging off the concerns about the potential militarization of their creations that in recent years have stirred employee revolts at industry giants like Google and Microsoft.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Luckey, dressed as if ready for the beach in a Hawaiian-like shirt, shorts and flip-flops, joined other Anduril employees at the company’s testing site near Camp Pendleton, a Marine training facility.As the drone took off and swooped between the hills, Mr. Luckey said it could track an object and capture detailed images from seven football fields away. Using many of the artificial intelligence technologies that underpin self-driving cars, Anduril’s drones can identify and track vehicles, people and other objects largely on their own.The drones are not armed, but could be useful for guarding bases or reconnaissance. The same sensor technologies that allow the drones to fly on their own could also be used to identify targets on a battlefield.Mr. Luckey, who sold his previous company, the virtual-reality start-up Oculus, to Facebook for $2 billion, shrugged off the question of whether tech companies should willingly work with the military and intelligence communities.“Most engineers want to engineer. They want to get stuff done,” the outspoken entrepreneur said as artillery fire echoed from a nearby range. “Most people have a pretty practical view.”The military and intelligence communities have a long history with research labs and tech companies in Silicon Valley. ARPANET, the forerunner of the internet, was funded by the Defense Department. David Packard, one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard, served as deputy secretary of defense under President Richard Nixon. Oracle, one of the biggest software companies, got its start writing computer code for the Central Intelligence Agency.But the idea of autonomous weapons has been controversial in Silicon Valley, and in recent years some in the tech industry have developed a new distrust of government work.That distrust swelled in 2013 when the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked documents that revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of large internet companies. In 2018, Google pulled out of a Defense Department effort to develop artificial intelligence technology after sustained protests from company workers.Parts of the Valley firmly draw the line at weaponization of their creations. Mike Volpi, a partner with the venture capital firm Index Ventures, said that Anduril’s drone technology impressed him but that his firm would not invest in any company whose technology could be used with weapons.“There are many ways to make money,” Mr. Volpi said. “If a company has a stated strategy to hurt people, we would not invest.”But a growing array of venture capital firms see things differently. Anduril is backed by several notable ones, including Founders Fund, created by the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel; Andreessen Horowitz; and General Catalyst.“We have the greatest technologists in the world in Silicon Valley,” said Katherine Boyle, a General Catalyst partner. “We really need to have Silicon Valley working with Washington.”With seed funding from the Founders Fund, Anduril was created in 2017. The founders included several former employees of Palantir, the Founders Fund-backed company that helps collect and analyze data for the government, and Mr. Luckey.Anduril chose Irvine, the heart of Orange County, partly because of the proximity to military posts and partly because the founders wanted to avoid the growing distrust for military work in Silicon Valley.“We are 400 miles away from Silicon Valley,” Mr. Luckey said. “Attitudes in Orange County have always been more pro-military.”Mr. Luckey is known for bucking Silicon Valley stereotypes. Just before Anduril was founded, he was pressured to leave Facebook after he donated to an organization built to spread anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. When I visited Anduril’s test site on a recent afternoon, other employees were wearing masks and standing six feet apart. But Mr. Luckey was maskless, and he asked if I would shake hands.In the drone business, however, he is not alone. A host of start-ups are building similar technology for the military. Shield AI, founded by a former member of the Navy SEALs, is in San Diego, not far from Anduril. Teal Drones, whose founder emerged from Mr. Thiel’s internship program, is in Salt Lake City.The Defense Department is hungry for small drones that will track objects and fly into buildings, combat zones and other dangerous areas with little help from remote pilots. Self-piloting drones will become a key part of fighting and other military activities in the years to come, said Mike Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, a Pentagon organization that aims to facilitate cooperation between the military and the tech industry.“We need to make sure we have friendly sources to buy from,” he said.Though some of the start-ups say their drones have already been used by the military, the technology is still in the early stages of deployment. But it raises concerns that artificial intelligence systems, used in tandem with weapons, could erode the role of human decision-making in combat.Asked if their drone technology could be used alongside weapons, some start-ups say it could. This, they argue, will be an essential part of U.S. efforts to maintain military parity with other countries. “Most people understand that this is part of what the military does,” Mr. Luckey said.Shield AI is fashioning autonomous drones for intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance in combat, and it says U.S. Special Operations Command has already used them in the field (which the Defense Department confirmed). A Shield AI co-founder, Ryan Tseng, said this kind of technology, like Anduril’s, could be used with weapons.But Skydio, a drone company in Silicon Valley founded by former Google employees, is more cautious. “We are not putting weapons on the drone,” the chief executive, Adam Bry, said. “Weaponization is the one thing where you want less automation, not more.”Inside its warehouselike headquarters in Irvine, Anduril is building a wide range of technologies, including sensor towers that can be used as a kind of “virtual border wall.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection is already using these towers to monitor parts of the southern border in Texas and California. It is also looking at using Anduril’s Ghost drones for similar purposes, said Chris Brose, the company’s chief strategy officer.A company spokesperson later said Anduril had done only “very early demonstration flights” with Customs and Border Protection. The company will not say how much its drones cost.But Anduril — named for a sword in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy — is also building drones for military use. Standing atop a hill overlooking the site where the company was testing its drones, Mr. Luckey and Brian Schimpf, another Anduril co-founder and the company’s chief executive, said the drones were used by Britain’s Royal Marines and had been tested by U.S. military, but they will not say which branches.The drones will provide surveillance in and around military bases, much as they can along the Mexican border. Mr. Luckey and Mr. Schimpf hope they can also be used for reconnaissance and other purposes.“You just say, ‘Find this thing.’ And that’s what it does,” Mr. Luckey said.Advertisement"
392,"Twitch, owned by Amazon, pulls Amazon’s anti-union ads",Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads,"Filed under:Twitch says the ads from its parent company ‘should never have been allowed to run’Twitch is removing the anti-union ads that its parent company, Amazon, was running on the platform. The ads showed Amazon employees talking about why they want to vote no on unionization and directed viewers to Amazon’s “DoItWithoutDues” website. A Twitch spokesperson said the ads “should never have been allowed to run on [the] service,” as they violate its political advertising policies. Twitch also says that it is “evaluating [its] review processes to ensure that similar content does not run in the future.”The ads were reported by More Perfect Union; their removal was first reported by Rod Breslau. The ads were the latest entry in a long campaign aimed at disrupting organization efforts at an Amazon warehouse outside of Birmingham, Alabama. Those efforts involve pulling employees into mandatory meetings, near-daily texts to employees, relentless anti-union posters in the workplace, and even reportedly changing the timing of traffic lights to disrupt a union drive. Amazon running the ads on a streaming platform it owns, however, was a very public move. It’s unclear if the company was targeting certain streams or viewers.Reached for comment, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) president Stuart Appelbaum denounced the ad. “Amazon feels that it has to go to extremes like this in order to gaslight its workers about the dreadful working conditions at its Bessemer warehouse,” Appelbaum said, “Amazon is leaving no stone unturned - including ads on Twitch - in its efforts to deceive and intimidate their employees into voting against the union.”Amazon was not immediately available for comment. Amazon is running a second ad on Twitch in Alabama urging its workers in Bessemer to vote no on the union. pic.twitter.com/q3wTc0o7ImThe union has also been having its own media push, with actor Danny Glover and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams encouraging workers to vote “yes.” Both talked about their connection with the South and how their upbringings and parents gave them respect for unions.The unionization fight comes after a string of troubling news for Amazon workers: the company allegedly forced its warehouse workers to work 10-hour overnight shifts, made plans to install always-on surveillance cameras in its delivery vehicles, and is being sued by the state of New York for allegedly failing to keep its frontline workers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Alabama unionization vote began on February 8th and is scheduled to conclude on March 29th. Update February 25th, 2:46PM ET: Added response from the RWDSU.A newsletter about computers"
393,Aurora acquires a second lidar company in push to bring self-driving trucks to the road,Business,https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/aurora-acquires-a-second-lidar-company-in-push-to-bring-self-driving-trucks-to-the-road/,"Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that recently closed its acquisition of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary, has snapped up another startup. This time, Aurora is buying OURS Technology, the second lidar startup it has acquired in less than two years. Aurora acquired Blackmore, a Montana-based lidar startup, in May 2019. Aurora declined to disclose the acquisition price or other financial terms of the deal. OURS Technology, which was founded in 2017 by a team of University of California-Berkeley researchers and PhDs, employs 12 people. The entire team is heading to Aurora, according to the company.“We are always on the lookout for how we can make progress as quickly as possible and OURS’s expertise in developing lidar chips adds to the expertise we already have and accelerates our work,” an Aurora spokesperson said.Lidar, or light detection and ranging radar, is considered by most companies developing autonomous driving systems a critical and necessary sensor to safely deploy self-driving vehicles at scale. A future where millions of self-driving vehicles coursing through cities is still years — even decades some argue — away. But that hasn’t prevented dozens of lidar companies from launching, each one aiming to cash in on that eventual demand. Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup BlackmoreThe vast majority of the 70-odd companies that exist in the industry today are developing and trying to sell time-of-flight lidar sensors, which send out pulses of light outside the visible spectrum and then measure how long it takes for each of those pulses to return. As they come back, the direction of, and distance to, whatever those pulses hit are recorded as a point and eventually forms a 3D map. Some lidar companies, including Blackmore and OURS Technology, are pursuing Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar, which emits a low-power and continuous wave, or stream, of light. FMCW lidar developers tout two primary benefits of this technology. It can measure distance with a higher dynamic range and instant velocity, meaning it can gauge the speed of the objects coming to or moving away from them. It also doesn’t struggle with interference from the sun or other other sensors. But FMCW is also complex. FMCW starts as a range finder on a chip. To make it a 3D lidar, many FMCW developers use big mirrors and other components to provide the field of view, which pushes up the size of the sensors. OURS Technology claims to be a lidar-on-a-chip company, which suggests that this four-year-old company has developed a way to combine everything into a solid-state scanning mechanism. This would allow the sensor to shrink in size, solving one of FMCW’s primary issues.Aurora unveiled last summer its so-called FirstLight Lidar, a sensor based on Blackmore’s technology that was developed for its fleet of self-driving vehicles, namely long-haul trucks. Aurora is clearly interested in OURS’s speed of development, noting in its announcement that the startup been able to produce four generations of lidar in just three years and developed a solid-state scanning mechanism compatible with its technology.The company plans to use the startup’s expertise and development know-how to make its sensor scalable. In short: Aurora hopes to use OURS’s team and their blueprint for key elements such as the solid-state scanning mechanism and development process to accelerate development.“Now, as we look to expand our fleet and commercialize our driverless trucks, FirstLight lidar must be increasingly scalable — it needs to be smaller and less expensive, but just as powerful,” the company said.Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora’s valuation to $10B"
394,Security researcher recommends against LastPass after detailing 7 trackers,Security,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302709/lastpass-android-app-trackers-security-research-privacy,"Filed under:1Password has zero trackers, and Bitwarden twoA security researcher is recommending against LastPass password manager after detailing seven trackers found in the Android app, The Register reports. Although there is no suggestion that the trackers, which were analyzed by researcher Mike Kuketz, are transferring a user’s actual passwords or usernames, Kuketz says their presence is bad practice for a security-critical app handling such sensitive information. Responding to the report, a spokesperson from LastPass says the company gathers limited data “about how LastPass is used” to help it “improve and optimize the product.” Importantly, LastPass tells The Register that “no sensitive personally identifiable user data or vault activity could be passed through these trackers.” They added that users can opt out of the analytics. On the LastPass web interface the option is located in the LastPass Privacy settings, accessible via “Account Settings > Show Advanced Settings > Privacy,” the spokesperson said.LastPass’s trackers include four from Google which handle analytics and crash reporting, as well as one from a company called Segment, which reportedly gathers data for marketing teams. Kuketz analyzed the data being transmitted and found it included information about the smartphone’s make and model, as well as information about whether a user has biometric security enabled. Even if the data transmitted isn’t personally identifiable, just integrating this third-party code in the first place introduces the potential for security vulnerabilities, according to Kuketz.“If you actually use LastPass, I recommend changing the password manager,” wrote Kuketz (via machine translation). “There are solutions that do not permanently send data to third parties and record user behavior.”LastPass isn’t the only password manager to include trackers like this, but it appears to have more than many popular competitors. Free alternative Bitwarden has just two according to Exodus Privacy, while RoboForm and Dashlane have four, and 1Password has none.The report comes on the heels of LastPass’s announcement to severely limit functionality in its free tier. While free users are currently able to store an unlimited number of passwords across devices without limitation, soon they’ll have to pick one category of devices to view and manage their passwords on — “Mobile” or “Computer” — unless they want to pay for the service. The changes will come into effect on March 16th.Update March 1st, 5:58AM ET: Updated to clarify that the opt-out is accessible via LastPass’s web interface.A newsletter about computers"

They must also disable within a day any post depicting an individual in a sexual act or conduct, said the rules, a draft copy of which was reported by Reuters on Wednesday.IT minister Prasad also told reporters the rules would oblige the companies to reveal the originator of a message or post when legally ordered.Facebook said it welcomed rules that prescribe ways to address challenges on the web. “The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules,” it said in a statement. Facebook-owned WhatsApp declined to comment.A Twitter spokesman said the company would study the guidelines and looked forward to continued engagement with the Indian government.“We believe that regulation is beneficial when it safeguards citizen’s fundamental rights and reinforces online freedoms,” he said in a statement.Tech firms are coming under tighter scrutiny worldwide. Facebook faced a backlash last week from some publishers and politicians after it blocked news feeds in Australia in a dispute with the government over revenue-sharing.That prompted last-ditch changes by Australia in a law passed on Thursday to ensure Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook pay media companies for content, a step that nations such as Britain and Canada want to follow.India’s rules will also require video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video to classify content into five categories based on users’ age, the government said.Online news media will also be regulated as part of the new rules, with the ministry of information and broadcasting creating an oversight system, the government added.Apar Gupta, the executive director at advocacy Internet Freedom Foundation, said the new rules for digital news media portals and video-streaming platforms posed risks to freedom of speech.“To fix the problems in these sectors the government has adopted an approach which carries the risks of political control and censorship,” he said.Reporting by Sankalp Pharityal and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Elizabeth Culliford in New York; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Lisa ShumakerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

398,"Insultingly, Facebook continues to try to convince users that privacy-violating targeted ads are good",Business,https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/25/insultingly-facebook-continues-to-try-to-convince-users-that-privacy-violating-targeted-ads-are-good,"Copyright © 2021, Quiller Media, Inc. Contact Us | Privacy PolicySomewhere along the line, Facebook moved from being the preposterously insecure social media service, into a corporation whose people seem pretty insecure —  which has been further demonstrated by the company on Thursday trying its latest attempt to convince people how privacy-breaking targeted advertisements are actually good for consumers. On Thursday, we are yet again seeing a Facebook blogging tirade where the company wants to be seen as our lone champion against —  well, anything it can grab on to. If you can't be bothered to read this latest diatribe, the short version is that the company appears to believe that we need our online habits tracked in order to provide us with more ads, and we should be thankful that Facebook gives us that.The even shorter version is that there's no difference from the last tirade —  except that the new blog has an accompanying ad campaign. It doesn't matter - Facebook knows you won't read it anyway. You, specifically you, the reader of this piece, will not do anything more than glance at this nonsense from Facebook and you will not be fooled by what is patently false —  but you're not the audience for these missives.Facebook has written off the audience that understands what it's doing, or which is interested enough to find out. It's probably right to figure out that we're all going to carry on using the service, but just in case, it is aiming very squarely at the audience who does not want to think about it.Hence the previous newspaper ads, read only by people who are involved in regulation. Hence the mutterings about taking Apple to court, believed only by people who hate Apple.Hence, too, Facebook's loud attack which comes over as deeply insecure defense. The fact is that if you know one single thing about privacy, you are not going to be supporting Facebook. Facebook knows it has lost the generally tech-savvy on privacy grounds. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle, there's no convincing you that they are for our good.But there is plenty of room to tell everybody else that this is really a very simple story of good versus evil, and Facebook is somehow maintaining that it is the good guy with a straight face. Facebook will not shut up about how it is the sole champion of all small businesses, even as that is not true, because everybody cares about small business owners. Facebook will not even whisper about the only absolutely true thing in its entire campaign, that it's afraid for its own profits. We all support the idea of people building a business out of nothing but then once they've done it, few worry too much about its bottom line. Facebook just makes it harder than ever to care about its income when it is quite plain that it does not care about us.Right back at the very start, when Mark Zuckerberg started ""The Facebook"" in Harvard, he described all users as being ""dumb f***s."" He's since said he regrets it, but if he ever genuinely changed his mind about us, the new tirades suggest he's changed it right back. In its quest to look like the good guy, Facebook is repeating statistics that have been disproven. But, it doesn't care because if it keeps saying them, enough people will believe.That does not include the tech savvy, but it does include the kind of America that doesn't live in technology, that doesn't follow its every move. That audience is the one most likely to stay with Facebook, so long as Facebook can persuade enough of them that it's a good guy. Facebook has always regarded its users with some level of disdain, but now it's vastly more blatant about it than ever. The tirades against Apple's privacy seem panicked, like a politician knowing he's about to be caught doing something incredibly stupid, and tries diverting attention. The fact that Facebook now so very loudly does not want you thinking about what it does, is making more people think about it. And you cannot think about Facebook's business model for one instant without being uncomfortable about it.So there's Facebook, forever disdaining us, now making us uncomfortable. And there's Facebook, blackmailing Australia and showing the rest of the world that it's ready to put charities in jeopardy unless it gets its way.And then there's Apple. While we admit this is part of Apple's entire marketing schtick, Tim Cook and Apple keeps telling us about privacy and giving us an informed choice of what we do or don't want to accept as it pertains to our habits, our information, and what we do on the internet.Apple is using privacy to sell its devices, and Facebook is using its total absence of privacy to sell us to advertisers. And to line its own pockets. Even Google has a better privacy record than Facebook does.Yet it truly does seem as if companies have personalities. Apple is an adult, and puts that foot forward, whether you agree with what it does or not. Facebook has the temperament of a child, whatever it does —  and most particularly when it gets caught with its hand in the cookie jar.Or perhaps it's a teenager. After all, as huge as it is now, it's acting as fragile and petulant as the student who created it 17 years ago.

Disputable perhaps, but Mark Zuckerberg is, in my laymen's opinion, a sociopath.Mark Zuckerfuck is the poster child for Humanity's Scumbags, in many ways more so than Trump was/is.I personally know people who've had their business DESTROYED because they were suckered / forced into going full-on into Facebook to find clients and perform marketing because EVERYONE is getting suckered into the promise of FREE, and suddenly they booted them off the system WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE of ANY KIND, and didn't even allow a dispute / appeal, thereby killing the business; one such SMB's owner had to declare bankruptcy.So FUCK FACEBOOK, FUCK ZUCKERBURG, and I sincerely hope his ""empire"" burns to the ground and fades into the midsts of history as the greatest failed mind-control experiment of all time!More proof that there is no revenue stream other than through personal information & advertising. People should sell their FB stock, bcoz once this becomes clear to everyone, the stock will free fall. Facebook's and Google’s business models are extremely simple to understand. Gather information about user's habits and sell the data to advertisers. That’s how they make money, period. They have no other revenue streams.I'm guessing he regrets getting caught saying it rather than actually changing his mind about his ""users.""iPhone 11 reunited with owner after spending 6 months in a lakeCoding error locks author with last name 'True' out of iCloudApple to pay more tax in UK following EU profit-shifting law repealOngoing & enormous Microsoft Exchange server hack hits 30,000 US groupsAdult content filters for iPhone and iPad required under Utah billApple discontinues iMac Pro, available 'while supplies last'Deals: Apple Magic Keyboard for 12.9-inch iPad Pro falls to record low $250 ($100 off)How to fix Photoshop's 'could not complete your request because of a program error' problem"

400,The Framework Laptop is the latest attempt at a true modular laptop,Hardware,https://www.techspot.com/news/88751-framework-laptop-latest-attempt-true-modular-laptop.html,"One of the major complaints about laptops introduced in the last few years has been that manufacturers are almost always prioritizing thin and light designs over upgradeability and repairability. Many PC laptops still have replaceable and/or upgradeable components like RAM and SSD storage, but in the case of MacBook owners these are all soldered to the logic board, while other things like the battery and Touch Bar are tricky even for repair professionals to deal with.In the smartphone land, consumers have to deal with a similar phenomenon, but there are some companies like Pine64 and Fairphone that push back against the current with repairable, modular, and even eco-friendly designs. This week, a startup called Framework announced a laptop built on similar principles, with components that are easy for users to replace or upgrade as needed.The new laptop comes with a 13.5-inch, 3:2 ratio display with a resolution of 2256 by 1504 pixels and over 400 nits of brightness. Its components are housed inside an aluminum chassis that is a hair under 16 mm thick, for a total weight of up to 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg). You can configure it with one of three 11th-gen Intel Tiger Lake processors with Xe integrated graphics -- i5-1135G7, i7-1165G7, or i7-1185G7 -- and up to a Wi-Fi 6E module for wireless connectivity.The CPU is the one notable component that can't be replaced as it's designed as a BGA package that's soldered onto the motherboard. However, the Framework team says it will release new motherboards in the future when newer CPUs come out, so theoretically that shouldn't be that big of a problem. And thanks to the lessons learned with the Alienware Area-51m R1, it's ultimately up to Intel to make things easier in that department.You can pair the processor with up to two 32 GB DDR4-3200 RAM modules for a total of 64 GB, and for storage you can configure up to a spacious, 4TB M.2 2280 NVMe SSD. The slot supports four-lane PCIe 4.0 drives, so you can install any of the fastest consumer SSDs out there.For connectivity, the Framework team came up with a nifty solution to the USB-C transition -- the four ports are recessed into the case to allow the installation of whatever ports you need for your use case via removable modules. Since these connect through USB-C, you can probably lend them to a friend or colleague in need of a USB-A, HDMI, microSD slot, DisplayPort, and even a headphone jack. This system also allows you to choose which side those ports are on, which can come in handy more often that you'd imagine.The screen is also replaceable, as is the magnetically-attached bezel that houses the 1080p webcam and microphone with physical privacy switches for both. The keyboard offers a 1.5 mm key travel, and you can choose a localized version if needed. Powering all the components in the Framework laptop is a 55 Wh battery that is also user-replaceable, as it's not glued to the case.The Framework team plans to offer this laptop with Windows 10 or Linux, starting this summer. There's no pricing information yet, but we do know it will also be offered as a ""DIY"" kit for those of you who want to assemble the laptop yourselves. As for the many user-replaceable parts, they'll be available in the Framework marketplace, which will be open to third party sellers of components.TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, GamersTechSpot is a registered trademark.

401,"SolarWinds hack was work of 'at least 1,000 engineers', tech executives tell Senate",Business,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/23/solarwinds-hack-senate-hearing-microsoft,"True scope of the breach, which affected 100 companies and several federal agencies, is still unknownLast modified on Wed 24 Feb 2021 15.58 GMTTech executives revealed that a historic cybersecurity breach that affected about 100 US companies and nine federal agencies was larger and more sophisticated than previously known.The revelations came during a hearing of the US Senate’s select committee on intelligence on Tuesday on last year’s hack of SolarWinds, a Texas-based software company. Using SolarWinds and Microsoft programs, hackers believed to be working for Russia were able to infiltrate the companies and government agencies. Servers run by Amazon were also used in the cyber-attack, but that company declined to send representatives to the hearing.Representatives from the impacted firms, including SolarWinds, Microsoft, and the cybersecurity firms FireEye Inc and CrowdStrike Holdings, told senators that the true scope of the intrusions is still unknown, because most victims are not legally required to disclose attacks unless they involve sensitive information about individuals. But they described an operation of stunning size.Brad Smith, the Microsoft president, said its researchers believed “at least 1,000 very skilled, very capable engineers” worked on the SolarWinds hack. “This is the largest and most sophisticated sort of operation that we have seen,” Smith told senators.Smith said the hacking operation’s success was due to its ability to penetrate systems through routine processes. SolarWinds functions as a network monitoring software, working deep in the infrastructure of information technology systems to identify and patch problems, and provides an essential service for companies around the world. “The world relies on the patching and updating of software for everything,” Smith said. “To disrupt or tamper with that kind of software is to in effect tamper with the digital equivalent of our public health service. It puts the entire world at greater risk.”“It’s a little bit like a burglar who wants to break into a single apartment but manages to turn off the alarm system for every home and every building in the entire city,” he added. “Everybody’s safety is put at risk. That is what we’re grappling with here.”Smith said many techniques used by the hackers have not come to light and that the attacker might have used up to a dozen different means of getting into victim networks during the past year.Microsoft disclosed last week that the hackers had been able to read the company’s closely guarded source code for how its programs authenticate users. At many of the victims, the hackers manipulated those programs to access new areas inside their targets.Smith stressed that such movement was not due to programming errors on Microsoft’s part but on poor configurations and other controls on the customer’s part, including cases “where the keys to the safe and the car were left out in the open”.George Kurtz, the CrowdStrike chief executive, explained that in the case of his company, hackers used a third-party vendor of Microsoft software, which had access to CrowdStrike systems, and tried but failed to get into the company’s email. Kurtz turned the blame on Microsoft for its complicated architecture, which he called “antiquated”.“The threat actor took advantage of systemic weaknesses in the Windows authentication architecture, allowing it to move laterally within the network” and reach the cloud environment while bypassing multifactor authentication, Kurtz said.Where Smith appealed for government help in providing remedial instruction for cloud users, Kurtz said Microsoft should look to its own house and fix problems with its widely used Active Directory and Azure.“Should Microsoft address the authentication architecture limitations around Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, or shift to a different methodology entirely, a considerable threat vector would be completely eliminated from one of the world*s most widely used authentication platforms,” Kurtz said.The executives argued for greater transparency and information-sharing about breaches, with liability protections and a system that does not punish those who come forward, similar to airline disaster investigations.“It’s imperative for the nation that we encourage and sometimes even require better information-sharing about cyber-attacks,” Smith said.Lawmakers spoke with the executives about how threat intelligence can be more easily and confidentially shared among competitors and lawmakers to prevent large hacks like this in the future. They also discussed what kinds of repercussion nation-state sponsored hacks warrant. The Biden administration is rumored to be considering sanctions against Russia over the hack, according to a Washington Post report.“This could have been exponentially worse and we need to recognize the seriousness of that,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. “We can’t default to security fatalism. We’ve got to at least raise the cost for our adversaries.”Lawmakers berated Amazon for not appearing at the hearing, threatening to compel the company to testify at subsequent panels.“I think [Amazon has] an obligation to cooperate with this inquiry, and I hope they will voluntarily do so,” said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican. “If they don’t, I think we should look at next steps.”Reuters contributed to this report."

Approves a $50 Monthly High-Speed Internet Subsidy | The money, aimed at low-income households, is part of an effort to bridge the access gap to broadband connectivity amid the pandemic.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/technology/fcc-broadband-low-income-subsidy.html,"AdvertisementSupported byThe money, aimed at low-income households, is part of an effort to bridge the access gap to broadband connectivity amid the pandemic.By Cecilia KangWASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved an emergency subsidy for low-income households to get high-speed internet, an effort to bridge the digital divide that has cut off many Americans from online communication during the pandemic.The four-member commission unanimously agreed to offer up to $50 a month to low-income households and up to $75 a month to households on Native American land for broadband service. The F.C.C. will also provide a one-time discount of up to $100 on a computer or tablet for eligible homes.The program will use $3.2 billion allocated late last year by Congress as part of its Covid-19 relief bill to bring internet service to American families for distance learning, work and digital health care.The program will be available within 60 days, said Jessica Rosenworcel, the acting chairwoman of the F.C.C. The agency still needs to sign up willing internet service providers and set up a program to approve and track recipients. At least 14.5 million Americans, according to a F.C.C. report, do not have broadband. Over the past year, the digital divide has taken on greater urgency.“This is a program that will help those at risk of digital disconnection,” Ms. Rosenworcel said in a statement. “It will help those sitting in cars in parking lots just to catch a Wi-Fi signal to go online for work. It will help those lingering outside the library with a laptop just to get a wireless signal for remote learning.”Eligible recipients include families with children on free or reduced lunch programs, Pell grant recipients and individuals who have lost jobs or seen their income fall in the past year.The digital divide has been among the most persistent problems for telecommunications policymakers. More than $8 billion in federal funding is allocated each year to the problem. Much of that is allocated to internet service providers to bring service to rural and other underserved areas.There are many challenges. Broadband maps, for instance, notoriously overcount how many households have access. If an internet service provider such as Charter or AT&T reaches just one home in a census block, the entire block appears connected on federal maps, even when all homes aren’t given the option of broadband.Ms. Rosenworcel announced the formation of a task force to study the agency’s tracking of broadband access data.Advertisement"

Hardware that is widely used to control equipment in factories and other industrial settings can be remotely commandeered by exploiting a newly disclosed vulnerability that has a severity score of 10 out of 10.The vulnerability is found in programmable logic controllers from Rockwell Automation that are marketed under the Logix brand. These devices, which range from the size of a small toaster to a large bread box or even bigger, help control equipment and processes on assembly lines and in other manufacturing environments. Engineers program the PLCs using Rockwell software called Studio 5000 Logix Designer.On Thursday, the US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Administration warned of a critical vulnerability that could allow hackers to remotely connect to Logix controllers and from there alter their configuration or application code. The vulnerability requires a low skill level to be exploited, CISA said.The vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2021-22681, is the result of the Studio 5000 Logix Designer software making it possible for hackers to extract a secret encryption key. This key is hard-coded into both Logix controllers and engineering stations and verifies communication between the two devices. A hacker who obtained the key could then mimic an engineering workstation and manipulate PLC code or configurations that directly impact a manufacturing process.“Any affected Rockwell Logix controller that is exposed on the Internet is potentially vulnerable and exploitable,” said Sharon Brizinov, principal vulnerability researcher at Claroty, one of three organizations Rockwell credited with independently discovering the flaw. “To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain the secret key and have the knowledge of the cryptographic algorithm being used in the authentication process.”Brizinov said that Claroty notified Rockwell of the vulnerability in 2019. Rockwell didn’t disclose it until Thursday. Rockwell also credited Kaspersky Lab and Soonchunhyang University researchers Eunseon Jeong, Youngho An, Junyoung Park, Insu Oh, and Kangbin Yim.The vulnerability affects just about every Logix PLC Rockwell sells, including:Rockwell isn’t issuing a patch that directly addresses the problems stemming from the hard-coded key. Instead, the company is recommending that PLC users follow specific risk mitigation steps. The steps involve putting the controller mode switch into run, and if that’s not possible, following other recommendations that are specific to each PLC model.Those steps are laid out in an advisory Rockwell is making available to customers, as well as in the above-linked CISA advisory. Rockwell and CISA also recommend PLC users follow standard security-in-depth security advice. Chief among the recommendations is ensuring that control system devices aren’t accessible from the Internet.If Logix PLC users are segmenting industrial control networks and following other best practices, it’s likely that the risk posed by CVE-2021-22681 is minimal. And if people haven’t implemented these practices, hackers probably have easier ways to hijack the devices. That said, this vulnerability is serious enough that all Logix PLC users should pay attention to the CISA and Rockwell advisories.Claroty has issued its own writeup here.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

        Rosie Frost
        Share this articleScientists are building a highly accurate digital simulation of planet Earth to provide reliable information about extreme weather and climate change.This “digital twin” will be a virtual representation of as many processes on the planet’s surface as possible including human impact on water, food and energy systems.In the past, climate and weather predictions have either focused on local regions or larger global systems. The new project, known as Destination Earth, will bring all of this information together alongside human actions to “depict the complex processes of the entire Earth system”.With our weather becoming more severe, there is a growing need to estimate the impacts of the climate crisis. Almost half a million people have died in natural disasters linked to extreme weather in the last two decades, according to Germanwatch. A UN report recently found that the number of climate-related incidents has dramatically increased since the 1980s.The project hopes to provide a method of testing scenarios that would help policymakers and scientists to prepare for the future. Hypothetical scenarios such as building wind farms across Europe and information on where to plant crops as our climate changes could be provided by the model.“If you are planning a two-​metre high dike in The Netherlands, for example, I can run through the data in my digital twin and check whether the dike will in all likelihood still protect against expected extreme events in 2050,” says Peter Bauer, co-initiator of Project Destination Earth.Destination Earth is a joint project between the number of European scientific organisations and experts in computing at ETH Zurich, a public research university in Switzerland.The European Union is making a big investment in green technology as part of the bloc’s plan to become the first climate neutral continent by 2050. The EU hopes this project will enable more sustainable development and support environmental policies in the coming years.In a recent study, researchers estimated that they would need a supercomputer with 20,000 graphics processors consuming around 20MW of power to create the highly complex model.“For both economic and ecological reasons, such a computer should be operated at a location where CO2-​neutral generated electricity is available in sufficient quantities,” says a press release from ETH Zurich.By 2025, the team aims to have up to five digital twins up and running. The data from these simulations will then be combined to create “a full digital twin of Earth”.Every weekday at 15.30 CET, Euronews Living brings you a cutting edge, environmental story from somewhere around the world.

    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at his company's annual F8 developer conference in 2017.Facebook is discussing building facial recognition into its upcoming smart glasses product and has been weighing the legal implications of the controversial technology, executives said at an internal meeting Thursday.During a scheduled companywide meeting, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that the company is currently assessing whether or not it has the legal capacity to offer facial recognition on devices that are reportedly set to launch later this year. Nothing had been decided, he said, and he noted that current state laws may make it impossible for Facebook to offer people the ability to search for others based on pictures of their face.“Face recognition ... might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things,” Bosworth said in response to an employee question about whether people would be able to “mark their faces as unsearchable” when smart glasses become a prevalent technology. The unnamed worker specifically highlighted fears about the potential for “real-world harm,” including “stalkers.”Following publication of this story, Bosworth wrote on Twitter that ""we’ve been open about our efforts to build [augmented reality] glasses and are still in the early stages.""""Face recognition is a hugely controversial topic and for good reason and I was speaking about was how we are going to have to have a very public discussion about the pros and cons,"" he said.Facebook has been touting a smart glasses product since last year, saying that it will arrive “sooner than later” in 2021. Built in partnership with Ray-Ban and its parent company, Luxottica Group, the wearable devices are expected to rival products from competitors Snapchat and Amazon, providing an augmented reality experience that will overlay digital features on people’s real-world perspectives.Bosworth’s comments about a Facebook facial recognition device come at a time of heated debate and scrutiny of the technology, which has been deployed by federal agencies, police departments, and even private companies — often in the name of safety and security. Critics and academics have decried the lack of federal regulation over the technology, which they say could undermine individual privacy. Some cities, including San Francisco and Boston, have already banned it from government use.Facebook, which has one of the largest repositories of user-uploaded photos, has taken a cautious approach to facial recognition. In 2015, it deployed a system called DeepFace that it’s since used to power features, such as photo tag suggestions, to identify people in pictures. Unlike Amazon, which sells its facial recognition tool to other companies and public entities, Facebook has not marketed DeepFace or any of its other facial recognition technologies for use beyond its own social network.In his remarks Thursday, Bosworth said he has been discussing facial recognition with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and he was overseeing a privacy review for the smart glasses product later in the day. Late last year, the vice president also noted in an internal memo, first reported by the Big Technology newsletter, that the company should “differentiate our products on the basis of privacy.”“We should become the undisputed leaders in providing privacy aware software,” Bosworth wrote in December.Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's vice president of augmented and virtual reality.While Bosworth said he understood privacy concerns over facial recognition on Thursday, he criticized current legislation, including Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which prevents private companies from collecting and storing biometric data like face scans without people’s consent. He noted the law was passed in 2008 and questioned how such out-of-date legislation could apply to the technologies of today.Last year, Facebook was ordered to pay $650 million to Illinois citizens for violating BIPA with its photo-tagging feature.“The real question is whether we will be able to recognize any faces at all, and we don’t know. Legally, the answer might be no, if you’re familiar with BIPA in Illinois ... people are making face recognition illegal,” Bosworth told employees Thursday. “That’s ok. We can do that as a society and this product will survive and thrive without it. I do think there are some lost opportunities, though.”In explaining possible use cases of facial recognition, Bosworth said that Facebook’s smart glasses may help someone recognize someone at a dinner party if they can’t remember their name or if they have face blindness.During the conversation, Facebook Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams noted that Facebook may need to develop its own principles on facial recognition that would take precedence in places where there are currently no laws governing the technology. “Just because you can [build something,] doesn’t mean you will,” she added, noting that the company would have to consider the product’s potential for harm and discrimination.As Facebook explores the possibility of adding facial recognition to future products, it’s been sparring with a company that scraped its photos and data to build its own facial recognition tool. Clearview AI, which has provided its software to hundreds of police departments, federal agencies, and private companies, trained its facial recognition tool, in part, on photos taken from Facebook and Instagram.While Facebook said previously that it’s sent cease and desist letters to Clearview for violating its terms of service, the company has yet to take legal action against the New York City–based startup.

409,The U.S. Air Force Just Admitted The F-35 Stealth Fighter Has Failed,ADBLOCK WARNING,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/02/23/the-us-air-force-just-admitted-the-f-35-stealth-fighter-has-failed/,"An F-35 assigned to the 356th Fighter Squadron takes off to participate in an agile combat ... [+] employment scenario at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, during exercise Cope North 21.The U.S. Air Force’s top officer wants the service to develop an affordable, lightweight fighter to replace hundreds of Cold War-vintage F-16s and complement a small fleet of sophisticated—but costly and unreliable—stealth fighters.The result would be a high-low mix of expensive “fifth-generation” F-22s and F-35s and inexpensive “fifth-generation-minus” jets, explained Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Brown Jr.If that plan sounds familiar, it’s because the Air Force a generation ago launched development of an affordable, lightweight fighter to replace hundreds of Cold War-vintage F-16s and complement a small future fleet of sophisticated—but costly and unreliable—stealth fighters.But over 20 years of R&D, that lightweight replacement fighter got heavier and more expensive as the Air Force and lead contractor Lockheed Martin

 packed it with more and more new technology. Yes, we’re talking about the F-35. The 25-ton stealth warplane has become the very problem it was supposed to solve. And now America needs a new fighter to solve that F-35 problem, officials said.With a sticker price of around $100 million per plane, including the engine, the F-35 is expensive. While stealthy and brimming with high-tech sensors, it’s also maintenance-intensive, buggy and unreliable. “The F-35 is not a low-cost, lightweight fighter,” said Dan Ward, a former Air Force program manager and the author of popular business books including The Simplicity Cycle.The F-35 is a Ferrari, Brown told reporters last Wednesday. “You don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays. This is our ‘high end’ [fighter], we want to make sure we don’t use it all for the low-end fight.”“I want to moderate how much we’re using those aircraft,” Brown said. Hence the need for a new low-end fighter to pick up the slack in day-to-day operations. Today, the Air Force’s roughly 1,000 F-16s meet that need. But the flying branch hasn’t bought a new F-16 from Lockheed since 2001. The F-16s are old.In his last interview before leaving his post in January, Will Roper, the Air Force’s top acquisition official, floated the idea of new F-16 orders. But Brown shot down the idea, saying he doesn’t want more of the classic planes. The 17-ton, non-stealthy F-16 is too difficult to upgrade with the latest software, Brown explained. Instead of ordering fresh F-16s, he said, the Air Force should initiate a “clean-sheet design” for a new low-end fighter.Brown’s comments are a tacit admission that the F-35 has failed. As conceived in the 1990s, the program was supposed to produce thousands of fighters to displace almost all of the existing tactical warplanes in the inventories of the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Air Force alone wanted nearly 1,800 F-35s to replace aging F-16s and A-10s and constitute the low end of a low-high fighter mix, with 180 twin-engine F-22s making up the high end. But the Air Force and Lockheed baked failure into the F-35’s very concept. “They tried to make the F-35 do too much,” said Dan Grazier, an analyst with the Project on Government Oversight in Washington, D.C. There’s a small-wing version for land-based operations, a big-wing version for the Navy’s catapult-equipped aircraft carriers and, for the small-deck assault ships the Marines ride in, a vertical-landing model with a downward-blasting lift engine.The complexity added cost. Rising costs imposed delays. Delays gave developers more time to add yet more complexity to the design. Those additions added more cost. Those costs resulted in more delays. So on and so forth.Fifteen years after the F-35’s first flight, the Air Force has just 250 of the jets. Now the service is signaling possible cuts to the program. It’s not for no reason that Brown has begun characterizing the F-35 as a boutique, high-end fighter in the class of the F-22. The Air Force ended F-22 production after completing just 195 copies.“The F-35 is approaching a crossroads,” Grazier said. Pentagon leaders have hinted that, as part of the U.S. military’s shift in focus toward peer threats—that is, Russia and China—the Navy and Air Force might get bigger shares of the U.S. military’s roughly $700-billion annual budget. All at the Army’s expense. “If we’re going to pull the trigger on a new fighter, now’s probably the time,” Grazier said. The Air Force could end F-35 production after just a few hundred examples and redirect tens of billions of dollars to a new fighter program.But it’s an open question whether the Air Force will ever succeed in developing a light, cheap fighter. The new low-end jet could suffer the same fate as the last low-end jet—the F-35—and steadily gain weight, complexity and cost until it becomes, well, a high-end jet. If that happens, as it’s happened before, then some future Air Force chief of staff might tell reporters—in, say, the year 2041—that the new F-36 is a Ferrari and you don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day. To finally replace its 60-year-old F-16s, this future general might say, the Air Force should develop an affordable, lightweight fighter.I'm a journalist, author and filmmaker based in Columbia, South Carolina."
410,The US Air Force Quietly Admits the F-35 Is a Failure,Hardware,https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/320295-the-us-air-force-quietly-admits-the-f-35-is-a-failure,"The Air Force has announced a new study into the tactical aviation requirements of future aircraft, dubbed TacAir. In the process of doing so, Air Force chief of staff General Charles Q. Brown finally admitted what’s been obvious for years: The F-35 program has failed to achieve its goals. There is, at this point, little reason to believe it will ever succeed.According to Brown, the USAF doesn’t just need the NGAD (Next Generation Air Dominance) fighter, a sixth-generation aircraft — it also needs a new, “5th-generation minus / 4.5th-generation aircraft.” Brown acknowledged some recent issues with the F-35 and suggested one potential solution was to fly the plane less often.“I want to moderate how much we’re using those aircraft,” the general said. “You don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays. This is our high end, we want to make sure we don’t use it all for the low-end fight… We don’t want to burn up capability now and wish we had it later.”These statements may not seem provocative, but they represent a huge shift in the Air Force’s stance regarding the F-35. The F-35 originated from what was originally known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, a multi-national development effort between the United States, the UK, and multiple other partner nations. The explicit purpose of the JSF program was to create a single aircraft that could replace a wide range of air, ground, and strike fighter capabilities. Today, the F-35 exists in three variants. The F-35A provides conventional takeoff/landing and is operated by the USAF, the F-35B provides short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STVOL) capabilities for the US Marines, and the F-35C is designed for carrier operations and is operated by the US Navy.The DoD and Lockheed-Martin have spent years painting the F-35 as a flexible, multi-role aircraft capable of outperforming a range of older planes. The rhetoric worked. The F-22 Raptor, F/A-18 Hornet, and several jets in the Harrier family were retired because the F-35 was supposed to replace them. The Air Force fought to replace the beloved A-10 Warthog with the F-35 on the grounds that the latter was, somehow, a superior replacement.This jet flew home. The F-35 has not proven itself to be equivalently robust. Credit: USAFThe F-16 was supposed to be replaced by the F-35. Back in 2010, Lockheed expected the F-35 to replace the F-15C/D variants as well as the F-15E Strike Eagle. That’s six different aircraft covering all three roles (air-to-air, strike, and ground). The F-35 was explicitly developed and designed to be a flexible, effective, and relatively affordable aircraft with sophisticated logistics management systems that would reduce downtime and boost reliability.This aircraft wasn’t supposed to be a Ferrari. It was billed, explicitly, loudly, and repeatedly, as the single platform that could fill any mission requirement and satisfy virtually any mission profile outside of something a B-52 might handle. Instead, the Air Force, Marines, and Navy have all adjusted plans at various times to keep older aircraft in service due to delays and problems with the F-35.To say the F-35 has failed to deliver on its goals would be an understatement. Its mission capable rate is 69 percent, below the 80 percent benchmark set by the military. 36 percent of the F-35 fleet is available for any required mission, well below the required 50 percent standard. Current and ongoing problems include faster than expected engine wear, transparency delamination of the cockpit, and unspecified problems with the F-35’s power module. The General Accountability Office (GAO) has blamed some of this on spare parts shortages, writing:[T]he F-35 supply chain does not have enough spare parts available to keep aircraft flying enough of the time necessary to meet warfighter requirements. “Several factors contributed to these parts shortages, including F-35 parts breaking more often than expected, and DOD’s limited capability to repair parts when they break.There have been so many problems with the F-35, it’s difficult even to summarize them. Pilot blackouts, premature part failures, software development disasters, and more have all figured in various documents over the years. Firing the main gun can crack the plane. The Air Force has already moved to buy new F-15EX aircraft. Multiple partner nations that once promised F-35 buys have shifted orders to other planes. The USAF continues to insist it will purchase 1,763 aircraft, but the odds of it doing so are increasingly dubious. The F-15EX costs an estimated $20,000 per hour to fly. The F-35 runs $44,000. Lockheed-Martin has promised to bring that cost down to $25,000, but it’s been promising that for years. Former Air Force pilots have not been kind in their recent evaluations of the aircraft’s performance and capabilities.Brown indicated he’s not interested in buying more F-16s, because not even the most advanced variants have the full scope of features the USAF hopes to acquire. This would presumably also disqualify the “F-21” Lockheed-Martin recently announced for the Indian market. Instead, Brown wants to develop a new fighter with fresh ideas on implementing proven technologies.Congress will have a voice in this discussion, so it’s far from a done deal, but after over a decade mired in failure, someone at the DoD is willing, however quietly, to acknowledge that the F-35 will never perform the role it was supposed to play. As for how much it’ll actually cost to build that 4.5th-generation fighter, all I’ll say is this: The F-35 was pitched to Congress and the world as a way of saving money. Today, the lifetime cost of the aircraft program, including R&D, is estimated to be over $1.5 trillion. The price of a supposedly cheaper 4.5-generation plane could easily match or exceed the F-35’s flyaway cost by the time all is said and done, though hopefully any future aircraft would still manage to offer a much lower cost per hour.Feature Image by Staff Sgt Joely Santiago, USAF. Now Read:Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

Fight For the Future, a digital rights group, says that beyond fueling the expansion of the police surveillance state, these cameras mean that even if you don't use Amazon you — and your kids — are going to be in Amazon’s system, being monitored and targeted.

Link copiedIn what one leading digital rights advocate is calling “the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history,” Amazon has begun installing artificial intelligence-equipped cameras in some of its partners’ delivery vehicles to monitor drivers while they work, a move that is raising broader concerns about privacy and corporate power.CNBC reported Wednesday that Amazon’s AI-powered, four-lens cameras — called Driveri — are being tested in a handful of contracted delivery vehicles. The cameras are manufactured by Netradyne, a San Diego-based startup, and record 100% of the time while vans are operating. They watch and record not only the drivers, but also the road and what’s happening around the vehicles.Driveri cameras feature AI software that detects up to 16 different safety issues, tracking everything from drivers’ eye movements to speed and braking. Certain violations will trigger automatic audio alerts.“Safety is our top priority at Amazon and it’s our hope that this new system will give drivers and DSPs [delivery service partners] peace of mind while out delivering smiles to our customers,” Karolina Haraldsdottir, a senior Amazon manager for last-mile safety, says in an instructional video sent to DSPs.Had to split it into 3 parts. Here’s part 2. These cameras will not only monitor Amazon drivers but also constantly record video to the front and both sides of the vehicle, and analyze it with AI. Amazon says openly they plan to use it to “investigate” things like “package theft” pic.twitter.com/bX1Jn5YeZJ— Evan Greer (@evan_greer) February 4, 2021However, many drivers — who must agree to have the cameras installed — labor unions, and privacy advocates expressed alarm over the intrusive technology.In an online petition, the digital rights group Fight For the Future warns that “Amazon will have roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and intersection in our communities.” The petition continues:[Amazon] will be watching everyone including your kids. Along with the millions of Ring doorbell cams, floodlight cams, and mailbox cams, Amazon will have the perfect panopticon in place to sweep up unprecedented amounts of data en masse. They already have 2,000+ partnerships with law enforcement and it seems super likely that they’ll start sharing footage from their vehicles the same way they share from Ring cameras — giving them access to license plates, biometric data, and enabling them to use facial recognition to track anyone’s movements across neighborhoods and cities.“Beyond fueling the expansion of the police surveillance state, this means even if you don’t use Amazon you’re going to be in their system, being monitored, and targeted,” the petition states.Anti-Black Amazon launches largest corporate surveillance program in US history. No doubt, they’ll use it to exploit Black workers, help ICE deport black immigrants + partner with cops to criminalize Black communities#StopAmazon ➡️https://t.co/dPF3k5v3EC pic.twitter.com/lMJgFvq7Pi— Fight for the Future (@fightfortheftr) February 4, 2021In a statement, Fight for the Future deputy director Evan Greer said that “this amounts to the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history.”Greer says the Amazon cameras will “violate everyone’s basic rights by constantly collecting and analyzing footage of our neighborhoods, our homes and our children,” data she says “can and will” be shared with law enforcement, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“There are essentially no laws in place to limit what commercial purposes Amazon can use this enormous trove of video footage for,” said Greer, who added that Fight for the Future is “demanding that Amazon immediately stop the roll out of this unsafe program” and urging Congress “to launch a full investigation into Amazon’s surveillance empire.”That “empire” includes Rekognition, a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) facial recognition technology sold to police and government agencies including ICE. Last June, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition over concerns about algorithmic bias.The move came at a time of increased public scrutiny of tech companies’ relationships with law enforcement in the wake of police killings of unarmed Black people including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.“When you layer a surveillance technology on top of a system that’s already discriminatory, it sort of automates, amplifies, exacerbates that discrimination, without rules in place to protect workers,” Greer told CNBC.The Driveri controversy comes the same week that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos — who has become the world’s first multicentibillionaire from selling products and services including surveillance technology — announced he is stepping down from the position to serve as executive chairman. His successor, longtime Amazon Web Services chief Andy Jassy, has been a staunch defender of the company’s surveillance products.Originally published by Common Dreams.Suggest a Correction

    By         Matthew Sparkes
Montezuma’s Revenge is one of the most challenging Atari gamesArcadeImages/AlamyAn artificial intelligence that can remember its previous successes and use them to create new strategies has achieved record high scores on some of the hardest video games on classic Atari consoles.Many AI systems use reinforcement learning, in which an algorithm is given positive or negative feedback on its progress towards a particular goal after each step it takes, encouraging it towards a particular solution. This technique was used by AI firm DeepMind to train AlphaGo, which beat a world champion Go player in 2016.
                    
Adrien Ecoffet at Uber AI Labs and OpenAI in California and his colleagues hypothesised that such algorithms often stumble upon encouraging avenues but then jump to another area in the hunt for something more promising, leaving better solutions overlooked.“What do you do when you don’t know anything about your task?” says Ecoffet. “If you just wave your arms around, it’s unlikely that you’re ever going to make a coffee.”To solve this problem, the team created an algorithm that remembers all the different approaches it has tried and keeps returning to moments in which it had a high score as a starting point from which to explore further.The software stores screen grabs from a game as it plays to remember what it has tried, grouping together similar-looking images to identify points in the game it should return to as a jumping-off point. The algorithm’s aim is to maximise its score and it updates its record of a starting point when it is used to reach a new high score with a new screen grab from that part of the game.Atari games don’t normally allow players to revisit any point in time, but the researchers used an emulator – software that mimicked the Atari system – with the added ability to save stats and reload them at any time. This meant the algorithm could begin from any point without having to play the game from the start.The team set the algorithm to playing a collection of 55 Atari games that has become a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms. It beat state-of-the-art algorithms in those games 85.5 per cent of the time.In one particularly complex game, Montezuma’s Revenge, the algorithm scored higher than the previous record for reinforcement learning software and also beat the human world record.Once the algorithm had reached a sufficiently high score, the researchers used the solution it came up with to train a neural network to replicate the strategy and play the game the same way, doing away with the need for reloading save states with an emulator. This alternative approach turned out to be more computationally intensive, as the neural network version of the algorithm created billions of screen grabs while solving each game.Peter Bentley at University College London says the team’s approach of combining reinforcement learning with an archive of memories could be used to tackle more complex problems. “This is a nice new combination of techniques that seem to provide a real enhancement.”Journal reference: Nature, DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-03157-9More on these topics:

Facebook is pushing back on new Apple privacy rules for its mobile devices, this time saying the social media giant is standing up for small businesses in television and radio advertisements and full page newspaper ads.Two titans of Silicon Valley, Facebook and Apple, are in a bitter fight that centers on the iPhone data of millions of people and whether companies should be able to track that data as easily as they do now.Facebook believes the answer is yes. On Wednesday, it even unveiled a video voiced by Grace Jones aimed at currying the public's favor.Apple says not so fast. CEO Tim Cook tweeted last month about the need for greater control over data privacy ""from safeguarding your health & financial data to guarding against algorithms that perpetuate rampant misinformation. We need transparency and reform.""What will happen?In the coming weeks, Apple will update its iOS software for iPhones to require apps to get explicit consent to track what people are doing on their phones for the purposes of sharing it with third parties.This type of tracking — which includes which apps are being used and for how long, which websites are visited, and data about a user's location — is tapped by advertisers to create hypertargeted, personalized advertisements.According to Apple, the average app has at least six trackers that are discreetly harvesting user data.Some apps, like Facebook, allow for some data tracking to be manually disabled. But by default, it is turned on. That gives the company reams of personal data on who we are and what we are doing, which it then vacuums up, packages and uses to sell ads.Starting sometime early this spring, Apple will require apps to send a push alert where people can either choose to ""ask app not to track"" or ""allow.""We believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it’s used. Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before, App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 will just require that they ask for your permission first. pic.twitter.com/UnnAONZ61IWhy does Facebook oppose Apple's update? While Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the move is about giving people more control over data collection practices he sees as intrusive, Facebook officials argue Apple is acting out of self-interest.Facebook says Apple is attempting to push free apps, which often sweep data up and feed it to advertisers, to move to subscription models. Apple, through its App Store, collects a 30% cut of in-app purchases, which critics dub ""the Apple tax."" In an interview with NPR, Facebook's director of privacy and public policy Steve Satterfield said Apple's forthcoming alert is an attempt to undercut the business model used by Facebook and other ad-supported free apps.""This discouragement, this is going to have a real impact on the Internet as we know it, which is increasingly going to move to a paid experience, which again, benefits Apple's bottom line,"" Satterfield said.Facebook has also launched a website and taken out full-page advertisements in newspapers, in addition to a recent TV and radio ad push, to put a spotlight on how many small business owners depend on targeted ads.The tech giant points to people like Monique Wilsondebriano. She launched the Charleston Gourmet Burger company in South Carolina. When she first started, she could not afford TV or radio ads. But she was able to drum up interest on Facebook. ""Ninety percent of our customers are finding us because of Facebook, because of those personalized ads, so if something was to disrupt that, it's going to be a problem,"" she told NPR.This perspective was so important to Facebook that officials invited Wilsondebriano and other small business owners to speak at a recent company press briefing. Yet privacy advocates and other prominent Facebook critics have raised doubts about whether the change will indeed significantly impact small business as much as profits at Facebook, which generates some 98% of its revenue from advertising. A recent study from the group TapResearch found that 55% of people surveyed said they would not let Facebook track them across apps if they were prompted. Some analysts predict Apple's update could result in a 7% hit to Facebook's revenue.It is personal between Cook and Zuckerberg In remarks delivered in late January at a technology and privacy conference in Brussels, Cook underscored Apple's emphasis on data privacy. ""It seems no piece of information is too private or personal to be surveilled, monetized and aggregated into a 360-degree view of your life,"" Cook said. Cook never mentioned Facebook by name, but in discussing a tech company's business model run amok, his target was clear. ""At a moment of rampant disinformation, and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement,"" said Cook, speaking just weeks after the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol. Back in 2018, Zuckerberg condemned Cook's comments criticizing Facebook turning users into the product as ""extremely glib"" and ""not at all aligned with the truth."" According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg at the time said this privately to his team about Cook's jabs against Facebook: ""We need to inflict pain."" Facebook and Apple: Opposite ways of making moneyBoth Silicon Valley giants, the companies' ways of making money and views of Internet are directly in conflict.Zuckerberg has long said the only way to build a social network that connects billions of people is for the platform to be free to use and supported by advertising. It is often said that when a tech service is ""free,"" users pay mightily with their data. And that is the case with Facebook, which compiles its own portrait of its users through granular behavior tracking and also has a lucrative business of selling data to third-parties, like data brokers and advertisers. Cook, meanwhile, is mostly in the hardware business. Apple makes most of its cash by selling iPhones, iPads and laptops. While Apple has apps that do a fair share of data mining, Apple claims it does not share that data with third parties. No doubt Apple's upcoming software update helps its image as a privacy protector. It is not lost on Cook that the message has proven especially resonant at a time when lawmakers and prosecutors seem ready to rein in the power of Big Tech, while other critics of Silicon Valley gain bipartisan support for rallying against the excesses of the industry.""We have an application like Facebook that's really driven by collecting data, and harnessing the value of that data,"" said Jordan Fischer, a law professor at Drexel University who follows privacy issues. ""And then we have Apple which is almost becoming this gatekeeper function for applications and saying we're going to mandate a certain minimum level of privacy, and they're clashing because they don't necessary work in the same world."" Analyst Dan Ives said this Facebook-Apple row is setting the stage for a larger fight over how technology companies will balance privacy with data collection in the digital economy.""I think Facebook is worrying about, 'This is just a first step for Apple. What could be in the next one to two years if they further put the clamps down around data privacy as well as advertising?' "" he said. ""Apple knows in this regulatory environment, not being flexible on privacy is ultimately going to be come down on their side.""Editor's note: Apple and Facebook are among NPR's financial supporters.

But the app led him up one of the steepest hills in Pittsburgh, a 4-mile one-way trip that clocked in at an hour. Then he noticed that  Uber had only paid him for 1 mile—the distance between his origin and destination as the crow flies, but not as the man bikes.“I’d only done 20 deliveries, and this already happened to me,” Samii says. “For people who do this full-time, are they going to look this deeply into this statement? Are they ever going to find this issue?”Samii is a software engineer. So he created a Google Chrome extension, UberCheats, that helps workers spot pay discrepancies. The extension automatically extracts the start and end points of each trip and calculates the shortest travel distance between the two. If that distance doesn’t match up with what Uber paid for, the extension marks it for closer examination.So far, only a few hundred workers have installed UberCheats on their browsers. Samii doesn’t have access to how couriers are using the extension, but he says some have told him they’ve used it to find pay inconsistencies. Google briefly removed the extension last week when Uber flagged it as a trademark violation, but reversed its decision after Samii appealed.The digital tool joins others popping up to help freelancers wrest back control over work directed by opaque algorithms, with pay structures that might change at any time. The need has only grown during the pandemic, which has seen companies like DoorDash, Amazon, and Instacart hire more contractors to support spikes in demand for deliveries. The expansion of the gig economy might be here to stay: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the “courier and messenger” sector could grow 13 to 30 percent more by 2029 than it would have without a pandemic. Globally, up to 55 million people work as gig workers, according to the research and advocacy group Fairwork.“Things are changed and hidden behind an algorithm, which makes it harder to figure out what you’re earning and spending and whether you’re getting screwed.” Katie Wells, research fellow, GeorgetownThe projects stem from practical need. In the US, many gig workers keep track of their miles and expenses for tax purposes. But the projects also grow out of workers’ growing mistrust of the companies that pay their wages. “I knew about gig companies’ business decisions that meant they weren’t paying well,” says Samii. But he says he hadn’t thought the apps might “pay for less work than you actually did.”The tools are particularly helpful to gig workers because of their low wages, and because it can be hard for isolated workers to share or find information about how the job pays, says Katie Wells, a research fellow at Georgetown University who studies labor. “Things are changed and hidden behind an algorithm, which makes it harder to figure out what you’re earning and spending and whether you’re getting screwed,” Wells says.Gig workers tend to have their own ways of tracking business expenses. Some delight in spreadsheets; others keep pens and notepaper in their glove box, so they can log miles and gas spending. Still others use apps built specifically to track mileage for tax purposes, like Stride and QuickBooks Self-Employed, which drivers can set up to run in the background of their phones as they pick up passengers and deliveries.Driver's Seat Cooperative helps gig workers track their hours across apps—and what they're really making.But some workers have been drawn to homegrown tools built by other gig workers—and the idea that they might themselves profit off the information that companies collect about them. Driver’s Seat Cooperative launched in 2019 to help workers collect and analyze their own data from ride-hail and delivery apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart. More than 600 gig workers in 40 cities have pooled their information through the cooperative, which helps them decide when and where to sign on to each app to make the most money, and how much they are making, after expenses. In turn, the company hopes to sell the data to transportation agencies interested in learning more about gig work, and pass on the profits to cooperative members. Only one city agency, in San Francisco, has paid for the data thus far, for a local mobility study that sent $45,700 to Driver’s Seat.Owen Christofferson has been driving for Uber and Lyft in Portland for six years and signed up to use Driver’s Seat when it launched. He hopes these sort of projects help all drivers keep better track of what they’re spending to earn. “It’s actually really, really complicated to figure out what you, as a gig worker using your own vehicle, are putting into this,” he says. “It's a kind of active disempowerment on the part of the companies, because many drivers might lack the resources or skills to understand their true hourly wage.”In a statement, Uber spokesperson Matthew Wing said that the company has built its own online tools to help drivers estimate their wages, including tips but not expenses. “If other tools accurately give drivers additional information and confidence in their experience, that's generally a good thing,” he said.Some workers have taken their push for data to court. A group of British Uber drivers has sued the ride-hail company in Amsterdam under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which gives EU citizens more control over their personal data. The drivers say their profiles, obtained through a request to Uber, have gaps, including scant detail on how the company evaluates their performance. Uber told TechCrunch that it had responded to the drivers’ data requests in 2019, and that the company’s “privacy team works hard to provide any requested personal data that individuals are entitled to.”An open source project called WeClock, launched by the UNI Global Union, seeks to help workers collect and then visualize data on their wages and working conditions, tapping into smartphone sensors to determine how often they’re sitting, standing, or traveling, and how they feel when they’re on the job. Once it’s collected, workers control their own information and how it's used, says Christina Colclough, who helped build the app and now runs an organizing consultancy called the Why Not Lab. “We don’t want to further the surveillance that workers are already subjected to,” she says. “We don’t want to be Big Tech with a conscience.”Colclough hopes that, eventually, workers might use WeClock to show they’re working longer hours than agreed. For now, the app is being used by 15 freelance UK TV production workers, who say that production companies don’t always pay fair wages for all the work they do. The participants in the pilot use Apple Watches to track their movements while on set.“I love my job,” says one production sound crew worker, who is using WeClock. (The worker asked not be named, for fear of retaliation in a close-knit industry.) “But I hope this can help expose a little bit of the ridiculous hours we work.”Updated, 2-25-20, 8pm ET: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Uber's tool to help drivers estimate their wages accounted for expenses.WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

The newest pledges by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions are falling far short of what’s needed to limit global warming to what the Paris climate accord seeks, a new United Nations report finds.So the U.N.’s climate chief is telling nations to go back and try harder.Most countries — especially top carbon polluters China, United States and India — missed the Dec. 31 deadline for submitting official emission-cutting targets for November’s climate negotiations in Scotland. Friday’s report provides an incomplete snapshot of the world’s efforts: The world’s pledges so far are only enough to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to less than 1% below 2010 levels by 2030.READ MORE: U.S. needs to brace for more deadly storms, experts sayThe world has to cut carbon pollution 45% below 2010 levels to achieve the more stringent official Paris goal of limiting future warming to another half a degree (0.3 degrees Celsius) from now, U.N. officials said.“We are very, very far from where we need to be,” U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. “What we need to put on the table is much more radical and much more transformative than we have been doing until now.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report “a red alert for our planet.”U.N. officials applauded the more than 120 nations, including the U.S. and China, that have made longer-term goals of net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century. But those same nations must translate long-term talk into the immediate action “that people and the planet so desperately need,” Guterres said.Instead of limiting the world to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the more stringent of two Paris accord goals — the data shows that world “is headed to close to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and a global catastrophe if this is not curtailed quickly,” said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a private group that tracks countries’ emissions targets.READ MORE: European court says governments must prove climate change effortThe 2015 Paris climate agreement had nations submit voluntary targets for how much heat-trapping gases they would spew by 2025 and update them every five years.With the big pandemic-delayed climate negotiations in Glasgow set for later this year, nations are supposed to submit updated and tougher goals for 2030. The U.S., the second biggest carbon polluter behind China, promises its goal will be announced before a special Earth Day summit in April.Fewer than half of the world’s countries, accounting for 30% of the world’s carbon emissions, submitted targets by the deadline. Only seven of the top 15 carbon polluting nations had done so.At least 10 countries that submitted goals last year did not provide tougher goals, Hare said. And because of changes to emissions in its base year calculations, Brazil essentially weakened its target from its 2015 version, said Taryn Fransen, a senior fellow at the think tank World Resources Institute.Espinosa said even countries that already gave targets need to go back and do better because “we are simply out of time.”Her predecessor and prime engineer of the Paris agreement, Christiana Figueres, said she thinks the U.S., China and Japan can change the picture when they announce their goals: “I have high hopes they will deliver.”China and the United States, with 35% of the world’s carbon emissions, can make a huge difference with their targets, Fransen said, noting that the U.S. can pledge to cut emissions in half from 2005 baseline levels by 2030 and can achieve that with concerted action.The goal the Obama Administration submitted in 2015 was to cut emissions 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. When he was president, Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement, but President Joe Biden put the country back in.WATCH: Power largely restored in Texas, but millions remain without drinking waterAfter dramatic decreases in carbon pollution in early 2020 because of the pandemic lockdown, initial data shows that near end-of-the-year emissions were back up to 2019 levels, pushed by China’s industrial production, said Corinne LeQuere, who tracks emissions at the University of East Anglia.The world adopted the more stringent 1.5 degree Celsius temperature goal in 2015 at the urging of small island nations, which fear being swamped by climate-related sea rise if temperatures pass that mark.“We are flirting dangerously” with the warming limit, said Ambassador Aubrey Webson of Antigua and Barbuda, chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States. “It is small island developing states like ours that will pay the ultimate price if we do not.”

417,Quantum Computing Breakthrough: Scientists Sent the First 'Landline' Message,Hardware,https://interestingengineering.com/quantum-computing-breakthrough-first-qubit-states-sent,"We're one step closer to a future enhanced with quantum computing.In a substantial breakthrough for quantum computing, researchers at the University of Chicago just sent entangled qubit states through a communication cable linking one quantum network node to another, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature.The initial results of this study bring us closer to making quantum computing a reality — laying the critical groundwork for future quantum communication networks.Qubits — also called quantum bits — are the fundamental units of quantum information. And, using their quantum properties like superposition — in addition to their capacity for entanglement — scientists and engineers are building the next-gen quantum computers capable of solving quantitative problems dwarfing the abilities of modern-day computers.The researchers — working from the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) at the University of Chicago (UChicago) — also successfully amplified an entangled state using a single cable to entangle two qubits in each of the two nodes, and then further entangled these qubits with other qubits in the nodes, according to a blog post shared on UChicago's website.""Developing methods that allow us to transfer entangled states will be essential to scaling quantum computing,"" said the lead scientist of the new research, Professor Andrew Cleland.The scientists of Cleland Lab used superconducting qubits — which are tiny cryogenic circuits capable of electrical manipulation — to complete their research.To transmit entangled states via communication cable — which was a 3.28-ft (1-m) long superconducting cable — the researchers constructed an experimental procedure where each of the two nodes had three superconducting qubits. The scientists connected one qubit in either node to the cable, and then transmitted quantum states in the form of microwave photons — and witnessed a minimal loss of information.Since quantum states are extremely fragile, the scientists faced a daunting challenge.A former postdoctoral fellow of Cleland named Youpeng Zhong built a system where the entire transfer process — going from one node through the cable to the other node — took only a few tens of nanoseconds, or one billionth of a second.To put this speed in perspective, a human lifespan doesn't even last one billion minutes. This extremely short burst of time allowed the research team to send entangled quantum states without losing too much information.The researchers' system also enabled them to ""amplify"" qubit entanglement. In other words, they entangled the qubits in either node together by basically sending one half-proton through the cable. Then they extended this entanglement to the other qubits in either node, and when the process was finished, all six qubits in the two nodes were entangled into a single, ""globally"" entangled state.In the future, scientists (and probably commercial entities) will likely build quantum computers out of modules — where ""families"" of entangled qubits carry out an extremely complex computation. These future computers may eventually consist of many such networked modules — like how modern-day supercomputers conduct parallel computing via many interconnected central processing units.""These modules will need to send complex quantum states to each other, and this is a big step toward that,"" said Cleland in the blog post. ""We want to show that superconducting qubits have a vital role going forward.""With the coming dawn of quantum computers, theoretical solutions for unconscionably complex math problems — with substantial relevance for theoretical physics — will finally have the computing power they demand. Encryption will transform how we communicate, and help transform telecommunications infrastructure and roads in ways even smart city initiatives have yet to imagine.This was a breaking story and was regularly updated as new information became available.By subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

419,Taiwan's chip industry under threat as drought turns critical,Business,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Taiwan-s-chip-industry-under-threat-as-drought-turns-critical2,"TSMC and UMC activate water-supply plans as reservoirs face depletion in 60 daysTAIPEI -- Taiwan's tech manufacturers fear their output is under threat from the island's worst drought in decades, risking more turmoil for global supply chains already strained by shortages of semiconductors and other key components.Taiwan's government will on Thursday further tighten water use in several cities that are home to a cluster of important manufacturers. Plants in Taoyuan, Taichung, Hsinchu and Miaoli will have to cut consumption by up to 11%, on top of a 7% cut requested last month.Manufacturers in the cities of Chiayi and Tainan -- where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, builds iPhone processors -- will be asked to reduce water use by 7% from Thursday.Taiwan is one of the world's most important sources of the advanced chips that power everything from cars and phones to servers and game consoles. Chip production requires massive amounts of water, but reservoirs in Taiwan are critically low and authorities have already cut supplies to agriculture to support industrial and residential use.The water concerns come as the chip sector battles worldwide shortages. Taiwan has promised to help countries like the U.S., Germany and Japan by speeding up the manufacture of automotive chips to ease a global crunch that has already hit car production.""All the industries are concerned whether the situation will be alleviated soon. ... No one wants to see the worst-case scenario of anyone being forced to dial back production capacity due to water issues,"" a executive at Winbond, a leading memory chipmaker, told Nikkei Asia.Large industrial users will be checked weekly to ensure the targets are met, a top government official told Nikkei Asia.The water needs of the island's manufacturers are growing despite efforts to conserve supplies.TSMC needs 156,000 tons of water a day, according to the company -- roughly one-third of all water used in Taiwan's key science parks. The company has initiated contingency plans to mobilize trucks from this week to supply water to production bases across the island.Water quality ""is extremely critical to chip production lines and the processes. ... It could affect product performance, so that needs to be handled very carefully,"" a person with knowledge of the plan said. ""So far the situation is manageable, but if it does not rain properly and continues like this till the end of May, that would be a real big problem.""TSMC has long-term contracts with water truck companies, which provide groundwater and well water that the chipmaker uses to supplement water from reservoirs in times of shortages, the person familiar with the plan said.Nina Kao, a spokesperson for TSMC, said of the plan to truck water: ""Deployments are still limited and the main purpose is to get the involved staff prepared for possible future needs.""TSMC reused 86.7% of its water, or 133.6 million tons, and saved an additional 7.93 million tons in 2019, according to its most recent social responsibility report.Taiwan's No. 2 contract chipmaker United Microelectronics said it will start to ask trucks to supply water to support its production from Thursday, company CFO and spokesperson Liu Chi-tung told Nikkei.""As the water-saving rate needs to increase to 11%, we need the support of additional water trucks,"" said Liu. ""Currently we only need a small percentage of additional water, but the company will adjust accordingly based on the dynamics.""Winbond, whose production is mostly in the central city of Taichung, has also planned tests of additional water trucks, the company executive said. The memory chipmaker has forged a business continuity plan to operate normally if the situation deteriorates and the water-saving rate must reach as high as 25%, the person said.AU Optronics, an Apple and Tesla display supplier, has prepared a series of measures to save water if the situation worsens, including reducing use in manufacturing, employee restaurants and restrooms, to keep its operations running.Unimicron, the world's biggest maker of ajinomoto-build-film board -- the key substrate for high-end automotive computing chips and chips used in 5G base stations -- said the water shortage is a concern, especially around Hsinchu, the heart of the chip industry.""We've been reserving water and we will use rental water trucks to support our use if necessary,"" company CFO Michael Shen said in an earnings call on Wednesday. ""If we keep having no rain ... it will be difficult for us to address the issue.""Water storage rates at Baoshan and Baoshan Second reservoirs -- which supply Hsinchu's Science Park -- stood at just 25.6% and 14.7% at noon on Wednesday.For the two reservoirs supplying Taichung Science Park, the storage rates were 16.6% and 13.9%, respectively, while the reservoir for Tainan Science Park was at only 15%.Taiwanstats, an open data site, cited data from the island's Water Resources Agency showing that these reservoirs will only be able to supply water for between 30 and 60 days unless there is sufficient rainfall in time to replenish them.Taiwan's chip sector, the second-largest after the U.S., is the crown jewel of the island's economy. However Taiwan's limited supplies of water, electricity and labor pose uncertainties for longer-term economic growth.Taiwan usually averages at least three typhoons each year, bringing much-needed rain, but none hit the island in 2020. The average water level of the nation's reservoirs is 1,000 millimeters lower than a year ago, according to the Water Resources Agency.""The situation is indeed more 'special' than we faced in 2015. Given there was no typhoon at all, we sensed the urgency and started responsive measures and discussions to brace for the water shortage as early as July last year -- months before the traditional dry season began,"" Lai Chien-hsin, Director-General of the agency, told Nikkei Asia.Su Chen-kang, director-general of Southern Taiwan Science Park, told Nikkei Asia that the tech and manufacturing sectors were on high alert, with messaging communication groups ""to make sure all the companies have the correct messages about water supply so that they could come up with better strategies and plans to battle the shortage"".To keep the tech manufacturing sector running, the Tsai Ing-wen administration on Feb. 1 started using a new water pipeline to draw water from Taoyuan to support Hsinchu. The government in late 2020 also approved an emergency plan to build a desalination plant in less than 70 days to supply more water to Hsinchu. The plant came online on Tuesday.""Climate change is dynamic and we have to always think ahead for the worst-case scenario. The government has been preparing for this and trying to increase supply since last year but we also need not just the suppliers but everyone in the nation to help conserve water, as the resources are limited and precious,"" Lai said.Sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.Discover the all new Nikkei Asia appDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia appStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia; the most dynamic market in the world.Stay ahead with our exclusives on AsiaGet trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.Get trusted insights from experts within Asia itself.

        Ryan Mac

    Posted on February 25, 2021, at 5:31 p.m. ET
    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at his company's annual F8 developer conference in 2017.Facebook is discussing building facial recognition into its upcoming smart glasses product and has been weighing the legal implications of the controversial technology, executives said at an internal meeting Thursday.During a scheduled companywide meeting, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that the company is currently assessing whether or not it has the legal capacity to offer facial recognition on devices that are reportedly set to launch later this year. Nothing had been decided, he said, and he noted that current state laws may make it impossible for Facebook to offer people the ability to search for others based on pictures of their face.“Face recognition ... might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things,” Bosworth said in response to an employee question about whether people would be able to “mark their faces as unsearchable” when smart glasses become a prevalent technology. The unnamed worker specifically highlighted fears about the potential for “real-world harm,” including “stalkers.”Following publication of this story, Bosworth wrote on Twitter that ""we’ve been open about our efforts to build [augmented reality] glasses and are still in the early stages.""""Face recognition is a hugely controversial topic and for good reason and I was speaking about was how we are going to have to have a very public discussion about the pros and cons,"" he said.Facebook has been touting a smart glasses product since last year, saying that it will arrive “sooner than later” in 2021. Built in partnership with Ray-Ban and its parent company, Luxottica Group, the wearable devices are expected to rival products from competitors Snapchat and Amazon, providing an augmented reality experience that will overlay digital features on people’s real-world perspectives.Bosworth’s comments about a Facebook facial recognition device come at a time of heated debate and scrutiny of the technology, which has been deployed by federal agencies, police departments, and even private companies — often in the name of safety and security. Critics and academics have decried the lack of federal regulation over the technology, which they say could undermine individual privacy. Some cities, including San Francisco and Boston, have already banned it from government use.Facebook, which has one of the largest repositories of user-uploaded photos, has taken a cautious approach to facial recognition. In 2015, it deployed a system called DeepFace that it’s since used to power features, such as photo tag suggestions, to identify people in pictures. Unlike Amazon, which sells its facial recognition tool to other companies and public entities, Facebook has not marketed DeepFace or any of its other facial recognition technologies for use beyond its own social network.In his remarks Thursday, Bosworth said he has been discussing facial recognition with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and he was overseeing a privacy review for the smart glasses product later in the day. Late last year, the vice president also noted in an internal memo, first reported by the Big Technology newsletter, that the company should “differentiate our products on the basis of privacy.”“We should become the undisputed leaders in providing privacy aware software,” Bosworth wrote in December.Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's vice president of augmented and virtual reality.While Bosworth said he understood privacy concerns over facial recognition on Thursday, he criticized current legislation, including Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which prevents private companies from collecting and storing biometric data like face scans without people’s consent. He noted the law was passed in 2008 and questioned how such out-of-date legislation could apply to the technologies of today.Last year, Facebook was ordered to pay $650 million to Illinois citizens for violating BIPA with its photo-tagging feature.“The real question is whether we will be able to recognize any faces at all, and we don’t know. Legally, the answer might be no, if you’re familiar with BIPA in Illinois ... people are making face recognition illegal,” Bosworth told employees Thursday. “That’s ok. We can do that as a society and this product will survive and thrive without it. I do think there are some lost opportunities, though.”In explaining possible use cases of facial recognition, Bosworth said that Facebook’s smart glasses may help someone recognize someone at a dinner party if they can’t remember their name or if they have face blindness.During the conversation, Facebook Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams noted that Facebook may need to develop its own principles on facial recognition that would take precedence in places where there are currently no laws governing the technology. “Just because you can [build something,] doesn’t mean you will,” she added, noting that the company would have to consider the product’s potential for harm and discrimination.As Facebook explores the possibility of adding facial recognition to future products, it’s been sparring with a company that scraped its photos and data to build its own facial recognition tool. Clearview AI, which has provided its software to hundreds of police departments, federal agencies, and private companies, trained its facial recognition tool, in part, on photos taken from Facebook and Instagram.While Facebook said previously that it’s sent cease and desist letters to Clearview for violating its terms of service, the company has yet to take legal action against the New York City–based startup.

422,TikTok agrees to pay $92 million to settle data breach lawsuits,Business,https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/26/tiktok-agrees-to-pay-92-million-to-settle-data-breach-lawsuits,"Copyright © 2021, Quiller Media, Inc. Contact Us | Privacy PolicyThe popular video-sharing app sees the agreement as a way to show the community that it respects users' privacy.The proposed settlement has been called one of the largest privacy-related payouts in history. It applies to over 89 million users —  some as young as six years old —  who claimed that the company engaged in ""The theft of private and personally identifiable TikTok user data."" The data was tracked and sold to advertisers in violation of stated and federal law.While TikTok has agreed to pay out the settlement, the company has gone on record saying that it does not agree with the assertions of the lawsuit. However, it believes that settling the case is the best path forward.""Rather than go through lengthy litigation, we'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,"" the spokesperson said.The legal battle has continued over a year, as the company faced allegations from both the public and the Trump administration that it had been stealing user data. The latter even argued that TikTok was a threat to national security, and had attempted to instate a country-wide ban. The company's lawyers see the settlement to show that TikTok is willing to protect its users in the future. ""First, it provides compensation for TikTok users, but equally as important, it ensures TikTok will respect its users' privacy going forward,"" Katrina Carroll, one of the lawyers for TikTok users, told NPR. ""Social media seems so innocuous, but troubling data collection, storage, and disclosure can happen behind the scenes.""The Biden administration has taken a different stance than President Trump's. Rather than going forward with the ban, President Biden and his team have decided to personally review the app's status as a threat to national security.Trump had attempted to get TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations arm to a U.S.-based company, with big names like Walmart, Microsoft, and Oracle tapped as prospective buyers.

Follow the money. Nothing! is free. All of these social media apps and platforms offer free access and often free services. So how do they pay the bills? A two year old could figure this out. They collect and sell your data to advertisers. All of them do this and you are the product they sell.Which is fine if they have your permission to do so. And there’s the rub. They are not asking your permission to sell your data, they are simply taking it because of some legalese in the small print of their terms of usage (which no one ver reads). Selling your data is the price you pay for using their services. It’s just like streaming services that charge you extra for ad-free streams. If you are okay with that, fine. Many are not but how else to generate revenue if the customer says no to selling their data? By charging fees for access to the platform and its services, that’s how. Are you willing to pay Facebook, TikTok, Google, etc. a subscription to be on their platform if your data is not collected and sold?
""...can happen""Yeah. Funny how the prevailing monetization strategy for the entire ""social media"" industry is something that ""can happen."" Although not in public view, of course - perhaps some of these companies have people who still possess a sense of shame.I have zero faith that this sort of result will ""[ensure]... respect [of] user's privacy going forward.""iPhone 11 reunited with owner after spending 6 months in a lakeCoding error locks author with last name 'True' out of iCloudApple to pay more tax in UK following EU profit-shifting law repealOngoing & enormous Microsoft Exchange server hack hits 30,000 US groupsAdult content filters for iPhone and iPad required under Utah billApple discontinues iMac Pro, available 'while supplies last'Deals: Apple Magic Keyboard for 12.9-inch iPad Pro falls to record low $250 ($100 off)How to fix Photoshop's 'could not complete your request because of a program error' problem"
423,Social media chatter skyrockets among Australian ‘anti-vax’ groups,Social Media,https://www.theage.com.au/national/social-media-chatter-skyrockets-among-australian-anti-vax-groups-20210227-p576cz.html,"Social media chatter among Australian anti-vaccination groups skyrocketed in the past week as the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine were delivered amid false claims that the jab would be mandatory.A protester at Health Minister Greg Hunt’s Mornington Peninsula electorate office holds a sign claiming the COVID vaccine is a poison that will alter people’s DNA. Credit:Luis Enrique AscuiAn independent project monitoring online vaccine sentiment for the federal government has reported that comments and other interactions surged from about 200 a day to almost 6000, within 20 key Australian anti-vaccination Facebook groups open to the public.It is only the second time since the pandemic began that such a notable jump has been observed, and the first time in almost a year.But researchers from the University of Western Australia leading the Coronavax project say the number of people in Australia’s anti-vaccination community, while growing, was still relatively small. There are around 300,000 followers in the public Facebook groups.They are also hopeful that when the local vaccine rollout begins to gather pace, social media will help normalise vaccination rather than stoking fear, as people begin to share their experience having the jab.“If enough of us do it, then it will become like the Ice Bucket Challenge,” said Dr Katie Attwell, chief investigator for the Coronavax project, referring to a viral social media challenge raising awareness for motor neurone disease.Thousands of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which is estimated to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing severe disease from COVID-19, were rolled out to frontline health and border workers and aged care residents in the past week.The first person in Australia to receive the first Pfizer dose was aged care resident and World War II survivor Jane Malysiak. Prime Minister Scott Morrison also received the vaccine.Credit:Edwina PicklesThe Coronavax project has been tracking vaccine sentiment since November, following Google trends and activity on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. What they learn about people’s concerns about the vaccine is then fed back to the Australian and Western Australian governments.Dr Tauel Harper from the University of Western Australia said the information was given to governments “not so they can bury that or hide it under the table, but so they can confront any potential issues”.For example, one of the issues he identified centres on a myth that the mRNA vaccines approved such as the Pfizer jab will change people’s DNA. A similar claim was made at a protest at Health Minister Greg Hunt’s electoral office on Saturday.But as University of Queensland virologist associate professor Ian Mackay explained, this is not how they work: “These vaccines don’t introduce their payload into the nucleus, where the chromosomes are and our DNA is,” he said.“What happens is the RNA gets delivered into the cytoplasm, which is the outside soupy part of the cell … and the cell machinery finds it and reproduces because of the way it’s been designed to be reproduced, and then it breaks down and goes away.”An anti-vaccination protest at Health Minister Greg Hunt’s office on Saturday.Credit:Luis Enrique Ascui Dr Harper’s work has seen him wade into the wild world of conspiracy theories, including those from QAnon, and he said this is at the heart of the largest and most fervently followed Facebook groups.But he said the posts that tended to spill over into the feeds of more Australians weren’t such radical conspiracies, rather those that play into the idea that the government has been overly repressive in its response to coronavirus in Australia (where they have been 909 COVID deaths, compared to more than half a million in the US).Dr Harper said the post that had received the greatest number of shares compared governments’ response to hunger with responses to coronavirus.Another thing he said received more widespread attention was false assertions the vaccinations would be made mandatory.The Australian government has insisted the coronavirus vaccine won’t be made mandatory. Although it is likely the vaccine will be required as a condition of international travel. Institutions could also introduce their own rules for participation, like a student college in Melbourne which flagged this week that a COVID vaccine would be mandatory for people living there.On Saturday, a Health Department spokeswoman said: “While the government supports immunisation, it is not mandatory and individuals maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate.”She said that the Australian government was actively considering the factors that may contribute to vaccine hesitancy, and the Health Department was in regular discussion with social media platforms to combat the spread of misinformation.“All departmental pages are regularly monitored and misinformation posts are reported as false information using the report button provided by each platform. The post is then hidden from public view. Issues that are escalated to the platform providers via email are responded to within a 24-hour time period,” she said.Dr Attwell said the focus on mandatory vaccines appeared to have been imported from America, borrowing the language of women’s rights proponents by framing it as an issue of personal choice.“That part is interesting, because no state or federal government in Australia has said that [the vaccine] is going to be mandatory and indeed they haven’t in America either,” she said.“And yet in both places we’re seeing a constituency preparing themselves for what they must believe is the likelihood that’s going to happen.”Dr Attwell, an expert in vaccine uptake, said that this could lead to misinformation circulating about what the government policy actually was on this issue.Victims of the coronavirus pandemic are buried in Brazil. Credit:Andre CoelhoA small survey by the University of Melbourne released this week suggested almost a quarter of Australians could be hesitant or resistant to getting the coronavirus vaccine.Epidemiologist with Victoria’s La Trobe University, associate professor Hassan Vally, said governments needed to be prepared to openly and honestly respond to every query people have about the vaccine, a view shared by Dr Harper who called for a website where the public could have their questions exhaustively answered.Professor Vally said many of those with doubts about receiving the jab would still be receptive to public health advice, and estimates only tiny fringe groups were anti-vaccination.“They are the ones spreading and fuelling all the conspiracy theories about the virus,” he said.“So there’s a big difference between intention and behaviour. We’re going to find out the extent to which people are hesitant by the way in which they embrace the vaccine in the coming weeks when it’s their turn to be vaccinated.”Our Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

425,What Happens When Cryptocurrencies Earn Interest?,Crypto,https://hbr.org/2021/02/how-blockchain-could-make-banks-obsolete?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+harvardbusiness+%28HBR.org%29,"Of all of the disruptive possible uses of blockchain, decentralized finance (or DeFi) might be the one most likely to bring this technology to a wide audience — and challenge the established finance industry in the process. By using self-executing contracts on newly formed marketplaces, DeFi allows users to stand in place of large institutions to loan and borrow money to each other, and to earn interest and fees by doing so. DeFi offers new opportunities to make money, such as “yield farming,” which often resemble traditional finance strategies. But it also offers a large-scale update to the basic plumbing of financial markets such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, offering more efficiency, transparency, and trust. There is significant risk inherent these crypto markets, but DeFi offers a less volatile and more accessible point of entry than other markets — and may just have enough appeal to bring blockchain into the mainstream.Cryptocurrencies have long been heralded as the future of finance, but it wasn’t until 2020 that it finally caught on to an old idea: making money with money. In the crypto world, decentralized finance (or DeFi) encompasses a wide array of blockchain-based applications intended to enhance cryptocurrency holders’ returns without relying on intermediaries — to earn the kind of passive returns an investor might get from a savings account, a Treasury bill, or an Apple Inc. bond.The idea seems to be catching fire: Deposits in DeFi applications grew from about $1 billion in June to just under $40 billion by late January 2021, suggesting that DeFi could be a major element of crypto from here on out. In the tradition of disruptive innovations — as Clayton Christensen envisioned them — DeFi can be the evolution of blockchain technology that might launch it into mainstream.The premise of DeFi is simple: Fix the longstanding inefficiency in crypto finance of capital being kept idle at a nonzero opportunity cost. Now, most investors buy crypto with the hope that the value of the currency itself will rise, as Bitcoin has. In general, that strategy has worked just fine. The value of cryptocurrencies has appreciated so rapidly that there just wasn’t much incentive to worry about gains of a few percent here and there.But the recent rise of stablecoins, which are designed keep their value constant, has changed that calculation. The combined market cap of stablecoins such as Terra and USDC has more than quadrupled in 2020. Now, vast passive income opportunities are being awakened by DeFi.The appeal of a lower-risk approach to crypto is obvious and has the potential to expand the pool of investors. For the first time, it’s possible to be compensated for owning cryptos (even in the absence of price appreciation), which brings real, tangible utilities to digital currencies and changes the narrative of an asset class whose sole purpose used to be about being sold at a higher price. Therefore, many of the DeFi protocols today might have the potential to become big and bold enough to rival their centralized counterparts, while staying true to their decentralized roots. Furthermore, with volatility out of the picture and the promise of more stable returns, institutional investors are now considering crypto as part of their investments in alternatives. The search for passive returns on crypto assets, called “yield farming,” is already taking shape on a number of new lending platforms. Compound Labs has launched one of the biggest DeFi lending platforms, where users can now borrow and lend any cryptocurrency on a short-term basis at algorithmically determined rates. A prototypical yield farmer moves assets around pools on Compound, constantly chasing the pool offering the highest annual percentage yield (APY). Practically, it echoes a strategy in traditional finance — a foreign currency carry trade — where a trader seeks to borrow the currency charging a lower interest rate and lend the one offering a higher return.Crypto yield farming, however, offers more incentives. For instance, by depositing stablecoins into a digital account, investors would be rewarded in at least two ways. First, they receive the APY on their deposits. Second, and more importantly, certain protocols offer an additional subsidy, in the form of a new token, on top of the yield that it charges the borrower and pays to the lender.Compound, for instance, has been rewarding users with a token that confers governance rights — the COMP token, which more or less represents a seat on the protocol’s board of directors — simply for using its service. While it costs Compound hardly anything to mint the coin, COMP is actively traded on the market and can be easily sold for cash should the owner so wish. As a consequence, those “bonus” tokens have been supercharging yields for both borrowers and lenders, often paying borrowers more than they have to repay lenders as COMP soars in price.As peculiar as it sounds, the subsidy does make economic sense. Getting more people to use the Compound protocol increases the value of the native token, which in turn attracts more users to “farm,” creating a positive growth loop. Furthermore, distributing governance tokens to users also achieves the objective of decentralizing ownership and gives the most active users voting rights that, when exercised, will determine the direction of future development of the protocol.While Compound has jumpstarted the crypto-lending trend and is growing in popularity, yield farming still requires expertise beyond the capability of an average investor. Succeeding in the game requires frequent trading, active monitoring, and meticulous risk management, not to mention contending with yields far more volatile than those in traditional finance.There are more retail-friendly DeFi projects, however. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is launching a new service called “Earn” that lets clients deposit their holdings in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into interest-bearing accounts with no minimum balance required. Similarly, BlockFi, a crypto lender backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, offers rates of up to 8.6% APY on deposits, while bank savings accounts offer a meager 0.05%. Anchor, a savings protocol on Terra’s blockchain, provide more stable yields to depositors in an attempt to bridge the DeFi experience to that offered by traditional finance.This might just be the beginning. The head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs recently stated that he envisions a future in which all of the world’s financial assets reside on electronic ledgers, and activities that today require squadrons of bankers and lawyers like initial public offerings and debt issuances could be largely automated.Electronic exchanges like the ones used by the NYSE or NASDAQ are a prime candidate to be at the forefront of this disintermediation. Markets function properly because there are mechanisms to set prices. While the NYSE and NASDAQ use order books (electronic lists of buy and sell orders) to do so, automated market makers (AMMs) — one of DeFi’s core building blocks — rely on algorithms to determine prices based on real-time supply and demand of each crypto asset in the market.AMMs have a number of desirable properties. The first is simplicity: AMMs only support market orders — orders to buy or sell immediately at the current price — not limit orders, which are set to execute at a specific price. Users, whether buying or selling, supply assets at quantities of their choosing and the AMM calculates the price. Second is transparency: The pricing mechanism, as well as all transactions, are available on a public ledger for anyone to inspect, so traders have confidence that the system is fair. Third, AMM pricing is continuous and is able to accommodate all order sizes without the “gaps” — orders that can’t be filled — often found in order books. Small orders barely move the price, while large orders become prohibitively expensive, making it impossible to deplete the pools. In other words, AMMs achieve a near-infinite market depth with finite liquidity. Finally, there are no counterparties in the traditional sense, because trades happen between users and contracts, which self-execute.Despite their advantages, AMMs have an important downside: There are a lot of hidden risks. Specifically, liquidity providers lose money when the value of a currency changes, where the bigger the change, whether up or down, the bigger the loss. To make the deal worth it, liquidity providers collect transaction fees, giving them a steady stream of income in exchange for the liquidity they supply — and hopefully offset any loses.The rapidly changing environment for AMM is exemplified by the Uniswap protocol, which has quickly become the most popular and attracted about 10% of all assets invested in DeFi. Built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, Uniswap recorded $58 billion in transaction volume over the course of the year. But for all of its success, a new competitor, SushiSwap, piggybacking on the open-source nature of the Uniswap codebase, was able to quickly pull users — and liquidity — onto their platform by offering users a SUSHI governance token. This is just an example of the risks of developing free software in a bitterly competitive new market space.As AMM platforms try to gain a foothold, the key question is: Can projects find the right mix of incentives to make their users loyal and their liquidity sticky, or are they forever at risk of disruption by competitors?In the wake of the near-zero interest rates across almost every major economy, DeFi has made cryptos an appealing choice for profit-seeking capital. Even institutions that have limited risk tolerance and prioritize passive income over capital appreciation, e.g. university endowments and institutional investors, are starting to dip their toes in. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citi are considering entering the crypto custody market following the OCC ruling on the topic. Visa is working with a digital asset bank, Anchorage, to allow customers of banks to purchase bitcoin. Also, traditionally risk-averse institutions such as the insurance company MassMutual and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) are looking to get exposure to crypto.This growing interest might meet further demand for democratizing finance by retail investors. For instance, the aftermath of the Gamestop debacle — with Robinhood halting trading in the Reddit-promoted stocks — has suggested that there might be demand for investment platforms that allow retail investors to trade directly while being shielded from the fury and censure of corporations and regulators. DeFi has already seized this opportunity in the form of Mirror Finance and Synthetix, decentralized applications that allow investors to trade synthetic or “mirrored” assets, such as stocks, free of interruption or censorship. The ripple effects of the Gamestop saga may take a long time to fully materialize, and it appears that DeFi is in prime position to benefit from it.Nonetheless, the fundamental law of the risk-return tradeoff might shed some light on why the interest rates are so tantalizing: At the end of the day, DeFi is still a far more dangerous spot to park your money with risks not well-understood by the average investor. All DeFi protocols run the risk of software bugs and/or copycats that can, in the worst case, drain liquidity completely. In addition, there is obviously no FDIC insurance protecting the deposits: Lending protocols like Compound or savings accounts like BlockFi can be subject to runs, while AMMs such as Uniswap require an entirely different risk tolerance for providing liquidity.In sum, not all DeFi products are for savings, and those that are surely are not for retirement savings. Not yet at least. But as its audience expands and institutions that are used to navigating the perils of a highly regulated industry join in, we expect DeFi to herald the long-awaited era where every household has cryptocurrencies working for it. After all, if money never sleeps, why should the cryptos?"
426,Report finds a rise in DevOps and cross-platform database use - TechRepublic,Software,https://www.techrepublic.com/article/report-finds-a-rise-in-devops-and-cross-platform-database-use/,"
        Latest Redgate DevOps report finds a major shift in how IT teams will be productive in the future.
    Nearly three quarters of organizations have now adopted DevOps in some form and they have also increased use of cross-platform databases, Redgate Software's 2021 State of Database DevOps Report shows. Some 74% of respondents are now taking a DevOps approach to development, compared to just 47% when the report was first published five years ago, according to the report. Further, almost half of respondents said they use three or more databases, compared with the 30% who are only using one database platform.Adoption of DevOps is at its highest ever, with 26% of respondents saying they are using DevOps across all projects compared to 18% in 2017, according to the report.Large enterprises are more likely to have adopted DevOps than smaller ones, and so are industries such as high-tech and financial services, the report said.Another marked development is the increase in the move to the cloud, which reverses a small decrease seen in last year's report, Redgate said. Fifty-eight percent said they now use the cloud either wholly or in combination with on-premises, compared to 46% in 2020, and 51% in 2019. Additionally, only one in five respondents said they are still hosting databases only on-premises.SEE: Top 5 programming languages for systems admins to learn (free PDF) (TechRepublic)The report notes that IT teams have remained remarkably productive despite working remotely. Eighty percent of respondents said remote work will remain in the long term, with 63% saying it has increased their productivity. Only 13% reported a negative impact, the report said.Forty-three percent of respondents said their organizations have grown above or in line with expectations, 13% have seen neither growth nor a decline, and just 9% have seen a fall, according to the report.This indicates that IT thinking has moved further, faster and perhaps more permanently than any previous year, Redgate said. ""Last year catalyzed digital transformation initiatives across the globe,'' noted Jakub Lamik, chief product officer, at Redgate, in a statement. ""While challenging, this enabling of IT teams to collaborate disparately and remotely has fundamentally changed the way we now consider how we work. It helped to accelerate our understanding of the ways IT teams can cooperate and continue to develop applications and databases when taking a remote-first approach.""That, in turn, has accelerated further the uptick in DevOps, the use of multiple database platforms for different use cases and the move to the cloud, Lamik added. Equally important, a clear correlation between DevOps adoption and software delivery performance has emerged, with high performers able to release both application and database changes faster, more frequently, and with fewer errors, Redgate said. The majority of respondents (84%), also expect the budget for database management and tooling to stay at least the same or increase in the next 12 months, indicating the importance of it within the overall IT strategy, the report said.  ""The rise of DevOps for both application and database development helped mitigate many of the challenges organizations faced as part of their digital transformation journeys,'' Lamik said. ""It enabled IT teams to remain productive even when working remotely, and encouraged them to explore new database platforms, both on-premises and in the cloud.""He said Redgate anticipates the biggest challenges for 2021 will be to manage the diversity of systems across different teams, while building on the past successes and greater level of maturity. Redgate said the 2021 State of Database DevOps Report, now in its fifth year, was based on a survey of more than 3,000 developers, database specialists and IT professionals from North and South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

The AI-based Recorder app was released with the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL in 2019, making its way to older Pixel smartphone models by December the same year. Now, Pixel users will be able to see transcriptions for their recordings on the Web app as well. The Web app allows you to “Share, play, and search your audio” and the URL for this is different from the recorder.withgoogle.com webpage.The Recorder Web app is now live at recorder.google.com and it allows you to share, play, and search through your recorded audio files. It shows recordings that have been backed up from the Recorder app on Google Pixel phones. The Recorder app is available for Pixel 2 and beyond and uses AI to show real-time transcriptions of audio recordings. With the Pixel 5, the app was updated to allow editing and sharing on social media platforms. However, as of now, it is unclear if these additional features will be available on the Web app.The interface for the Recorder Web app has a seek bar at the bottom along with play/ pause button, rewind and jump forward buttons, volume control, and what seems to be an option to change the layout of the recording.According to a report by 9to5Google, Recorder for Web requires Pixel users to update the app on their phones to be able to start uploading content to the cloud, that can then be accessed from the Web app. The report also points out that the Web app will not let users record audio but will only transcribe the audio recorded and uploaded from a Pixel phone.The idea of a desktop interface is to allow users to more conveniently sort through long recordings that may not be ideal on a phone's display. It would also make seeking (or scrolling) through the recording much easier.PS5 vs Xbox Series X: Which is the best ""next-gen"" console in India?

As part of its anti-union campaign, Amazon ran anti-union ads on Twitch, the games streaming giant that it owns. Now Twitch has broken with its parent company and told Motherboard it has removed the ads, and that they should never have run in the first place.""Twitch does not allow political advertising, and these ads should never have been allowed to run on our service,” a Twitch spokesperson told Motherboard in an email. “We have removed these ads and are evaluating our review processes to ensure that similar content does not run in the future. We are grateful to our community for bringing this to our attention.""The ads, which were first reported by More Perfect Union, feature an Amazon warehouse employee explaining why they don't need a union: “We at the Birmingham team have great leadership. We really don’t need anyone coming in and telling us what they want to give us,” the worker says. “We have everything we need here. Always wanted to work for Amazon.”“I will vote no for the union,” a chorus of voices says as the ad closes. “It’s not needed. Vote no, we can do it without the dues.”The ad echoes talking points that Amazon has plastered around its Bessemer warehouse to convince workers to defeat a campaign to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). As Motherboard reported Wednesday, this has included a glossy mailer instructing employees how to ""Vote NO,"" anti-union messaging in bathrooms, on websites, and in warehouses.“Amazon is leaving no stone unturned —including ads on Twitch—in its efforts to deceive and intimidate their employees into voting against the union,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of RWDSU. Political ads aren’t allowed according to Twitch’s terms of service. Sharing political opinions is allowed, but “you agree not to solicit the use of or use any Twitch monetization tool (e.g., Bits or subscriptions) for the purpose of making or delivering a contribution to a candidate, candidate’s committee, political action committee, ballot committee, or any other campaign committee, or otherwise for the purpose of influencing any election,” the TOS said. “Candidates for political office are not eligible to use any Twitch monetization tool on their channels.”"
429,Exclusive: Senators revive bill to combat Chinese censorship of U.S. companies,Politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-censorship-exclusive-idINKBN2AN2JZ,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Michael Martina4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators will revive legislation as soon as Wednesday to counter Chinese censorship in the United States, a new effort by Congress to hold Beijing accountable for its growing efforts to stifle criticism beyond its borders, Senator Jeff Merkley told Reuters.U.S. officials have complained that the Chinese government has increasingly sought to suppress opposition to its ruling Communist Party by coercing U.S. companies – from hotel chains and airlines to Hollywood film producers – to take pro-Beijing stances.“We must monitor and address the impacts of China’s censorship and intimidation of Americans and our companies, so we can create a strategy to safeguard this bedrock freedom and hold those accountable who suppress and destroy it,” Merkley, a Democrat leading the effort who will soon be chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in emailed comments.The bill is co-sponsored by Republicans Marco Rubio and John Cornyn, as well as Democrat Elizabeth Warren. A similar bill was introduced in 2019, but stalled.The new censorship bill would direct the president to set up an interagency task force under the National Security Council to monitor and address China’s censorship or intimidation of Americans and U.S. companies.It would mandate a report with recommendations for “industries in which freedom of expression issues are particularly acute, including the media and film industries,” according to a copy of the proposed legislation seen by Reuters.The censorship bill is among a barrage of legislation to confront China, as deeply divided Democrats and Republicans in Congress find common ground opposing Beijing. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday he had directed lawmakers to craft a package of measures to counter China’s rise.Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr said last year that Hollywood companies routinely caved to pressure and censored their films to “appease” China, which last year overtook the United States as the world’s largest film market. Entertainment companies did not respond to Barr’s allegations at the time.National Basketball Association games were taken off the air in China for a year in 2019 following a tweet from a Houston Rockets manager backing Hong Kong democracy protests.In 2018, the Chinese government compelled global airlines and hotel chains to change their online references to Taiwan to imply the self-ruled democratic island is part of China.A Democratic Senate aide involved with the bill said drafters recognized it was a sensitive issue for companies, and did not want to make bad guys out of “victims of economic coercion.”“We want to help provide focus in the U.S. government to address this problem,” the aide said. “In a certain sense, we are trying to help insulate companies from pressure rather than raise the temperature further.”Some in Congress argue that a task-force approach is not sufficient and call for a stronger response, such as making it easier for U.S. employees to sue if fired based on pressure from China, or requiring U.S. universities to disclose financial ties to Confucius Institutes, which are Chinese government-backed cultural centers.American allies have also warned of Chinese censorship playing out at home. Germany said on Tuesday that China had tried to intimidate Hong Kong residents living in the country since pro-democracy protests broke out in the city two years ago.President Joe Biden, who has voiced concern about China’s “coercive and unfair” trade practices, and endorsed a Trump administration determination that China has committed genocide in its Xinjiang region, has signaled his administration will maintain pressure on Beijing.Reporting by Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Mary Milliken and Peter CooneyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Andrew Torba admits the site is aware it had a vulnerability to an SQL injection attack and patched the flaw last week, followed by a security audit that is still ongoing.Where this all leads is hard to tell, but a reporter linked to DDoSecrets tweeted ""Yes, we have the data"" and promised more information ""soon enough.""Please enter a valid email address"
431,John Deere Fails to Uphold Right to Repair Agreement Signed in 2018,Business,https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/320183-john-deere-fails-to-uphold-right-to-repair-agreement-signed-in-2018,"In September 2018, the Equipment Dealers Association signed an agreement with John Deere in which the company would begin voluntarily making repair tools, software guides, and diagnostic equipment available for ordinary farmers to purpose beginning January 1, 2021. We’re now well over two months into 2021 and, as a new report details, John Deere isn’t keeping up its end of the bargain.The purpose of the agreement between John Deere and the EDA was to deal with the increasingly onerous software lockouts John Deere baked into its tractors. Farmers have been increasingly forced to visit a John Deere dealership for even trivial repairs because once-simple replacements now require dealer-authorized equipment to authenticate the hardware. The deal with the EDA took the pressure off of states to pass right-to-repair legislation. At the time, ExtremeTech characterized it as “throwing farmers under the bus” because of numerous structural deficiencies.But those deficiencies, like a failure to define the need for fair and reasonable pricing on spare parts (or the need for purchasable spare parts at all), are less important here. The problem isn’t that John Deere has balked at implementing part of the agreement. It’s that John Deere apparently hasn’t lifted a finger to implement it. Both Vice and the US Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) recently followed-up on how the rollout of this new information has gone.The blown-up version of the “Statement of Principles.” Photo by the Farwest Equipment Dealers Association.Kevin O’Reilly of US PIRG called 12 John Deere dealerships across six states. He reports: “Of those, 11 told me that they don’t sell diagnostic software and the last one gave me an email of someone to ask for the tools. I sent an email two days ago and haven’t heard anything back.” Vice then performed its own survey, calling 9 different dealerships in 7 different states outside of California and three inside of it. One California dealership offered to try and help with the problem, the other two immediately stated no such information or manuals were available. None of the other 9 had access to offer or product to sell, nor information regarding when either would be made available.According to John Deere and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, a major industry lobbying group, there’s absolutely nothing wrong. The AEM claims “comprehensive repair and diagnostic information is now available for the vast majority of the tractor and combine market through authorized dealers.” When US PIRG asked AEM to provide even one example of a company actually making this information available, the trade group failed to respond.At a right-to-repair meeting with the Florida Farm Bureau, John Deere customer support manager Aaron Vance made the following public comments: “Many of these manufactures, ourselves included, we provide diagnostic tools, repair manuals, parts. Diagnostic and repair information for you, the producer has always been around, you’ve always had parts, you’ve always been able to get manuals, paper and such,” he said. “You have the right to repair your own equipment.”There is very little evidence to support this claim, particularly the “always had parts” and “always been able to get manuals” portions. Vice located one farmer in Montana, Walter Sweitzer, whose dealership agreed to provide him with software, equipment, and training to upkeep his own tractor, for $8,000. His story appears to be virtually unique.There are up to 125 sensors in a John Deere tractor, and an error code on any of them can put a device into Limp mode, where it can be driven, but not otherwise operated. It can take up to a month for a piece of equipment to get a simple error code cleared, and it can cost a great deal of money. According to Missouri farmer Jared Wilson, he lost tens of thousands of dollars in income one season because it took 32 days for the dealer to repair a mechanical valve that failed on his fertilizer spreader. Had he been able to access the parts and diagnostic tools he needed, he believes he would have been able to perform the work himself. Wilson reached out to ET directly and told us he now has the option to license a “neutered version” of John Deere’s Service Advisor software, but at $4000 / year, it’s beyond what his farm (or business, if you prefer) can afford.No one wants access to John Deere’s software so they can steal source code or muck with emissions sensors. The farmers that have gone looking for hacked software available online aren’t trying to monetize John Deere’s intellectual property; they’re trying to clear error codes and regain the ability to fix simple problems.Right-to-repair is an issue that affects almost everyone. And while manufacturers from Apple to John Deere have tried to make it an issue of security and IP protection, this is actually about holding on to the income stream that a repair monopoly represents. It’s rent-seeking behavior, not an actual benefit to farmers or their customers, otherwise known as “people who eat.” Farmers and farming communities do not presently appear to have access to the diagnostic software and manuals that John Deere previously promised to make available, and the deficiency is not limited to a single state or regional area.Back in 2018, John Deere boasted that this agreement meant right-to-repair legislation wasn’t necessary. Three years later, the company is demonstrating just how necessary it is by failing to abide by its own voluntary commitments.Update (2/24/2020): An earlier version of this story misstated Jared Wilson’s location (Missouri, not Kansas) and the circumstances of the breakdown. Wilson didn’t need an older model spreader. He needed the software and diagnostics that would have told him how to fix the problem.

432,Clubhouse's Security and Privacy Lag Behind Its Explosive Growth,Social Media,https://www.wired.com/story/clubhouse-privacy-security-growth/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Lily Hay NewmanTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.In recent months, the audio-based social media app  Clubhouse has emerged as Silicon Valley's latest disruptive darling. The format feels familiar: part Twitter, part Facebook Live, part talking on the phone. But as Clubhouse continues to expand, its security and privacy failings have come under increased scrutiny—and left the company scrambling to correct problems and manage expectations.Clubhouse, still in beta and available only on iOS, offers its users “rooms” that are essentially group audio chats. They can also be set as public addresses or panel discussions where some users are “speakers” and the rest are audience members. The platform reportedly has over 10 million users and is valued at $1 billion. Since last year it has been an invite-only haven for Silicon Valley elite and celebrities, including an Elon Musk appearance earlier this month. But the company has struggled both with concrete security issues and more ephemeral questions around how much privacy its users should expect. “With smaller, newer social media platforms, we should be on our guard about our data, especially when they go through huge growth it tests a lot of the controls,” says security researcher Robert Potter. “Things you might have gotten away with with only 100,000 people on the platform—you increase those numbers tenfold and the level of exposure goes up, the threat goes up, the number of people probing your platform goes up.”Recent security concerns about Clubhouse run the gamut from vulnerabilities to questions about the app's underlying infrastructure. A little over a week ago, researchers from the Stanford Internet Observatory put a spotlight on the platform when they found that the app was transmitting users' Clubhouse identifiers and chatroom identity numbers unencrypted, meaning that a third party could have potentially tracked your actions in the app. The researchers further pointed out that some of Clubhouse's infrastructure is run by a Shanghai-based firm and it seemed that the app's data was traveling through China at least some of the time—potentially exposing users to targeted or even widespread Chinese government surveillance. Then, on Sunday, Bloomberg confirmed that a third-party website was scraping and compiling audio from Clubhouse discussions. Early Monday, further revelations followed that Clubhouse discussions were being scraped for an unaffiliated Android app, allowing users on that operating system to listen along in real-time. Arielle PardesC. Brandon OgbunuArielle PardesPotter, one of the researchers who investigated the different Clubhouse data scraping projects, explains that these apps and websites didn't seem malicious; they just wanted to make Clubhouse content available to more people. But the developers were only able to do so because Clubhouse didn't have anti-scraping mechanisms that could have stopped that. Clubhouse didn't limit how many rooms a single account could stream from at once, for example, so anyone could create an application programming interface to stream every public channel at the same time.More mature social networks like Facebook have more developed mechanisms for locking their data down, both to prevent user privacy violations and to defend the data they hold as an asset. But even they can still have potential exposures from creative scraping techniques.Clubhouse has also come under scrutiny for its aggressive collection of users' contact lists. The app strongly encourages all users to share their address book data so Clubhouse can help you make connections with people you know who are already on the platform. It also requires you to share your contact list in order to invite other people to the platform, since Clubhouse is still invite-only, which contributes to a sense of exclusivity and privacy. Numerous users have pointed out, though, that when you go to invite others, the app also makes suggestions based on what phone numbers in your contacts are also in the contacts of the largest number of Clubhouse users. In other words, if you and your local friends all use the same florist, doctor, or drug dealer, they very well could show up on your list of suggested people to invite.Clubhouse did not respond to a request from WIRED for comment by press time about its recent security stumbles. In a statement to the Stanford Internet Observatory researchers, Clubhouse detailed specific changes it planned to make to strengthen its security, including cutting off pings to servers in China and strengthening its encryption. The company also said it would work with a third-party data security firm to help see the changes through. In response to the unauthorized website that was re-streaming Clubhouse discussions, the company told media outlets that it had permanently banned the user behind it and would add additional “safeguards"" to prevent the situation from occurring again.Though Clubhouse seems to be taking researcher feedback seriously, the company hasn't been specific about all of the security improvements it has implemented or plans to add. Additionally, given that the app doesn't appear to offer end-to-end encryption to its users, researchers say there is still a sense that Clubhouse hasn't given adequate thought to its security posture. And that's even before you grapple with some of the fundamental privacy questions the app raises.When you start a new Clubhouse room, you can choose from three settings: An “open” room is accessible by any user on the platform, a “social” room only admits people you follow, and a “closed” room restricts access to invitees. Each comes with its own implicit level of privacy, which Clubhouse could make more explicit.    “I think for public rooms, Clubhouse should give users the expectation that public means public to all users, since anyone can join and record, take notes, etc.” says David Thiel, chief technology officer of the Stanford Internet Observatory. ""For private rooms, they can convey that as with anycommunication mechanism, an authorized member can record contents and identities, so make sure you both establish expectations and trust the participants.""Like any prominent social network, Clubhouse has also struggled to deal with abuse on the platform. The app's terms of service ban hate speech, racism, and harassment as of November, and the platform offers some moderation features, like the ability to block users or flag a room as potentially abusive. But one of Clubhouse's biggest features is also a problem for anti-abuse: People can use the platform without the liability that their contributions will be automatically saved as posts. This can embolden some users to make abusive or derogatory remarks, thinking they won't be recorded and won't face consequences.Stanford's Thiel says that Clubhouse currently stores recordings of discussions temporarily to review in case of abuse claims. If the company were to implement end-to-end encryption for security, though, it would have an even more difficult time staying on top of abuse, because it wouldn't be able to make those recordings so easily. Every social media platform faces some version of this tension, but security experts agree that, when relevant, the benefits of adding end-to-end encryption are worth the added challenge of developing more nuanced and creative anti-abuse solutions. Even end-to-end encryption doesn't eliminate the additional possibility that any Clubhouse user could be externally recording the conversation they're in. That's not something Clubhouse can easily solve. But it can at least set expectations accordingly, no matter how friendly and off the record the conversation feels. ""Clubhouse should just be clear about what it’s going to contribute to your privacy,"" says Potter, ""so you can set what you’re going to talk about accordingly.”WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

433,Chinese Hackers Had Access to a U.S. Hacking Tool Years Before It Was Leaked Online,Security,https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/chinese-hackers-had-access-to-us.html,"On August 13, 2016, a hacking unit calling itself ""The Shadow Brokers"" announced that it had stolen malware tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, a sophisticated threat actor believed to be affiliated to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).Although the group has since signed off following the unprecedented disclosures, new ""conclusive"" evidence unearthed by Check Point Research shows that this was not an isolated incident, and that other threat actors may have had access to some of the same tools before they were published.The previously undocumented cyber-theft took place more than two years prior to the Shadow Brokers episode, the American-Israeli cybersecurity company said in an exhaustive report published today, resulting in U.S.-developed cyber tools reaching the hands of a Chinese advanced persistent threat which then repurposed them in order to strike American targets.""The caught-in-the-wild exploit of CVE-2017-0005, a zero-day attributed by Microsoft to the Chinese APT31 (aka Zirconium), is in fact a replica of an Equation Group exploit codenamed 'EpMe,'"" Check Point researchers Eyal Itkin and Itay Cohen said. ""APT31 had access to EpMe's files, both their 32-bits and 64-bits versions, more than two years before the Shadow Brokers leak.""The Equation Group, so-called by researchers from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky in February 2015, has been linked to a string of attacks affecting ""tens of thousands of victims"" as early as 2001, with some of the registered command-and-control servers dating back to 1996. Kaspersky called the group the ""crown creator of cyberespionage.""First revealed in March 2017, CVE-2017-0005 is a security vulnerability in the Windows Win32k component that could potentially allow elevation of privileges (EoP) in systems running Windows XP and up to Windows 8. The flaw was reported to Microsoft by Lockheed Martin's Computer Incident Response Team.Check Point has named the cloned variant ""Jian"" after a double-edged straight sword used in China during the last 2,500 years, referencing its origins as an attack tool developed by the Equation Group that was then weaponized to serve as a ""double-edged sword"" to attack U.S. entities.Jian is said to have been replicated in 2014 and put in operation since at least 2015 until the underlying flaw was patched by Microsoft in 2017.APT31, a state-sponsored hacking collective, is alleged to conduct reconnaissance operations at the behest of the Chinese Government, specializing in intellectual property theft and credential harvesting, with recent campaigns targeting U.S. election staff with spear-phishing emails containing links that would download a Python-based implant hosted on GitHub, allowing an attacker to upload and download files as well as execute arbitrary commands.Stating that the DanderSpritz post-exploitation framework contained four different Windows EoP modules, two of which were zero-days at the time of its development in 2013, Check Point said one of the zero-days — dubbed ""EpMo"" — was silently patched by Microsoft ""with no apparent CVE-ID"" in May 2017 in response to the Shadow Brokers leak. EpMe was the other zero-day.DanderSpritz was among the several exploit tools leaked by the Shadow Breakers on April 14, 2017, under a dispatch titled ""Lost in Translation."" The leak is best known for publishing the EternalBlue exploit that would later power the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware infections that caused tens of billions of dollars' worth of damage in over 65 countries.This is the first time a new Equation Group exploit has come to light despite EpMo's source code being publicly accessible on GitHub since the leak almost four years ago.For its part, EpMo was deployed in machines running Windows 2000 to Windows Server 2008 R2 by exploiting a NULL-Deref vulnerability in Graphics Device Interface's (GDI) User Mode Print Driver (UMPD) component.""On top of our analysis of both the Equation Group and APT31 exploits, the EpMe exploit aligns perfectly with the details reported in Microsoft's blog on CVE-2017-0005,"" the researchers noted. ""And if that wasn't enough, the exploit indeed stopped working after Microsoft's March 2017 patch, the patch that addressed the said vulnerability.""Apart from this overlap, both EpMe and Jian have been found to share an identical memory layout and the same hard-coded constants, lending credence to the fact that one of the exploits was most probably copied from the other, or that both parties were inspired by an unknown third-party.But so far, there are no clues alluding to the latter, the researchers said.Interestingly, while EpMe didn't support Windows 2000, Check Point's analysis uncovered Jian to have ""special cases"" for the platform, raising the possibility that APT31 copied the exploit from the Equation Group at some point in 2014, before tweaking it to suit their needs and ultimately deploying the new version against targets, including possibly Lockheed Martin.Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said ""our cybersecurity team routinely evaluates third-party software and technologies to identify vulnerabilities and responsibly report them to developers and other interested parties.""Additionally, a source familiar with Lockheed Martin's cyber research and reporting told The Hacker News that the Windows vulnerability was found on an unnamed third-party's network — and not on its own or its supply chain — as part of threat monitoring services it provides to other entities.Check Point's findings are not the first time Chinese hackers have purportedly hijacked NSA's arsenal of exploits. In May 2019, Broadcom's Symantec reported that a Chinese hacking group called APT3 (or Buckeye) also had repurposed an NSA-linked backdoor to infiltrate telecom, media, and manufacturing sectors.But unlike APT31, Symantec's analysis pointed out that the threat actor may have engineered its own version of the tools from artifacts found in captured network communications, potentially as a result of observing an Equation Group attack in action.That Jian, a zero-day exploit previously attributed to APT31, is actually a cyber offensive tool created by the Equation Group for the same vulnerability signifies the importance of attribution for both strategic and tactical decision making.""Even though 'Jian' was caught and analyzed by Microsoft at the beginning of 2017, and even though the Shadow Brokers leak exposed Equation Group's tools almost four years ago, there is still a lot one can learn from analyzing these past events,"" Cohen said.""The mere fact that an entire exploitation module, containing four different exploits, was just lying around unnoticed for four years on GitHub, teaches us about the enormity of the leak around Equation Group tools.""Sign up for cybersecurity newsletter and get latest news updates delivered straight to your inbox daily."
434,The SAFE Tech Act Wouldn't Make the Internet Safer for Users,Politics,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/safe-tech-act-wouldnt-make-internet-safer-users,"Section 230, a key law protecting free speech online since its passage in 1996, has been the subject of numerous legislative assaults over the past few years. The attacks have come from all sides. One of the latest, the SAFE Tech Act, seeks to address real problems Internet users experience, but its implementation would harm everyone on the Internet. The SAFE Tech Act is a shotgun approach to Section 230 reform put forth by Sens. Mark Warner, Mazie Hirono and Amy Klobuchar earlier this month. It would amend Section 230 through the ever-popular method of removing platform immunity from liability arising from various types of user speech. This would lead to more censorship as social media companies seek to minimize their own legal risk. The bill compounds the problems it causes by making it more difficult to use the remaining immunity against claims arising from other kinds of user content. Addressing Big Tech’s surveillance-based business models can’t, and shouldn’t, be done through amendments to Section 230—but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done at all. The act would not protect users’ rights in a way that is substantially better than current law. And it would, in some cases, harm marginalized users, small companies, and the Internet ecosystem as a whole. Our three biggest concerns with the SAFE Tech Act are: 1) its failure to capture the reality of paid content online, 2) the danger that an affirmative defense requirement creates and 3) the lack of guardrails around injunctive relief that would open the door for a host of new suits that simply remove certain speech.Before considering what this bill would change, it’s useful to take a look at the benefits that Section 230 provides for all internet users. The Internet today allows people everywhere to connect and share ideas—whether that’s for free on social media platforms and educational or cultural platforms like Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, or on paid hosting services like Squarespace or Patreon. Section 230’s legal protections benefit Internet users in two ways. Section 230 Protects Intermediaries That Host Speech: Section 230 enables services to host the content of other speakers—from writing, to videos, to pictures, to code that others write or upload—without those services generally having to screen or review that content before being published. Without this partial immunity, all of the intermediaries who help the speech of millions and billions of users reach their audiences would face unworkable content moderation requirements that inevitably lead to large scale censorship. The immunity has some important exceptions, including for violations of federal criminal law and intellectual property claims. But the legal immunity’s protections extend to services far beyond social media platforms. Thus everyone who sends an email, makes a Kickstarter, posts on Medium, shares code on Github, protects their site from DDOS attacks with Cloudflare, makes friends on Meetup, or posts on Reddit, benefits from Section 230’s immunity for all intermediaries. Section 230 Protects Users Who Create Content: Section 230 directly protects Internet users who themselves act as online intermediaries from being held liable for the content created by others. So when people publish a blog and allow reader comments, for example, Section 230 protects them. This enables Internet users to create their own platforms for others’ speech, such as when an Internet user created the Shitty Media Men list that allowed others to share their own experiences involving harassment and sexual assault. In what appears to be an attempt to limit deceptive advertising, the SAFE Tech Act would amend Section 230 to remove the service’s immunity for user-generated content when that content is paid speech. According to the senators, the goal of this change is to stop Section 230 from applying to ads, “ensuring that platforms cannot continue to profit as their services are used to target vulnerable consumers with ads enabling frauds and scams.” With this change, even if the defendant ultimately prevails against a plaintiff’s claims, they will have to defend themselves in court for longer, driving up their costs.But the language in the bill is much broader than just ads. The bill says Section 230’s platform immunity for user-generated content does not apply if, “the provider or user has accepted payment to make the speech available or, in whole or in part, created or funded the creation of the speech.” Much, much more of the Internet is likely included behind this definition than advertising, and it is unclear how much paid or sponsored content this language would sweep up. This change would undoubtedly force a massive, and dangerous, overhaul to Internet services at every level. Although much of the legislative conversation around Section 230 reform focuses on the dominant social media services that are generally free to users, most of the intermediaries people rely on involve some form of payment or monetization: from more obvious content that sits behind a paywall on sites like Patreon, to websites that pay for hosting from providers like GoDaddy, to the comment section of a newspaper only available to subscribers. If all companies that host speech online and whose businesses depend on user payments lose Section 230 protections, the relationship between users and many intermediaries will change significantly, in several unintended ways:Harm to Data Privacy: Services that previously accepted payments from users may decide to change to a different business model based on collecting and selling users’ personal information. So in seeking to regulate advertising, the SAFE TECH Act may perversely expand the private surveillance business model to other parts of the Internet, just so those services can continue to maintain Section 230’s protections. Increased Censorship: Those businesses that continue to accept payments will have to make new decisions about what speech they can risk hosting and how they vet users and screen their content. They would be forced to monitor and filter all content that appears whenever money has exchanged hands—a dangerous and unworkable solution that would find much important speech disappeared, and would turn everyone from web hosts to online newspapers into censors. The only other alternative—not hosting user speech—would also not be a step forward. As we’ve said many times, censorship has been shown to amplify existing imbalances in society. History shows us that when faced with the prospect of having to defend lawsuits, online services (like offline intermediaries before them) will opt to remove and reject user speech rather than try to defend it, even when it is strongly defensible. These decisions, as history has shown us, are applied disproportionately against the speech of marginalized speakers. Immunity, like that provided by Section 230, alleviates that prospect of having to defend such lawsuits. Unintended Burdens on a Complex Ecosystem: While minimizing dangerous or deceptive advertising may be a worthy goal, and even if the SAFE Tech Act were narrowed to target ads in particular, it would not only burden sites like Facebook that function as massive online advertising ecosystems; it would also burden the numerous companies that comprise the complex online advertising ecosystem. There are numerous intermediaries between the user seeing an ad on a website and the ad going up. It is unclear which companies would lose Section 230 immunity under the SAFE TECH Act; arguably it would be all of them. The bill doesn’t reflect or account for the complex ways that publishers, advertisers, and scores of middlemen actually exchange money in today’s online ad ecosystem, which happens often in a split second through Real-Time Bidding protocols. It also doesn’t account for more nuanced advertising regimes. For example, how would an Instagram influencer—someone who is paid by a company to share information about a product—be affected by this loss of immunity? No money has exchanged hands with Instagram, and therefore one can imagine influencers and other more covert forms of advertising becoming the norm to protect advertisers and platforms from liability. For a change in Section 230 to work as intended and not spiral into a mass of unintended consequences, legislators need to have a greater understanding of the Internet ecosystem of paid and content, and the language needs to be more specifically and narrowly tailored.The SAFE Tech Act also would alter the legal procedure around when Section 230’s immunity for user-generated content would apply in a way that would have massive practical consequences for users’ speech. Many people upset about user-generated content online bring cases against platforms, hosts, and other online intermediaries. Congressman Devin Nunes’ repeated lawsuits against Twitter for its users’ speech are a prime example of this phenomenon. The increased legal costs of even meritless lawsuits will have serious consequences for users’ speech. Under current law, Section 230 operates as a procedural fast-lane for online services—and users who publish another user’s content—to get rid of frivolous lawsuits. Platforms and users subjected to these lawsuits can move to dismiss the cases before having to even respond to the legal complaint or going through the often expensive fact-gathering portion of a case, known as discovery. Right now, if it’s clear from the face of a legal complaint that the underlying allegations are based on a third party’s content, the statute’s immunity requires that the case against the platform or user who hosted the complained-of content be dismissed. Of course, this has not stopped plaintiffs from bringing (often unmeritorious) lawsuits in the first place. But in those cases, Section 230 minimizes the work the court must go through to grant a motion to dismiss the case, and minimizes costs for the defendant. This protects not only platforms but users; it is the desire to avoid litigation costs that leads intermediaries to default to censoring user speech.The SAFE Tech Act would subject both provider and user defendants to much more protracted and expensive litigation before a case could be dismissed. By downgrading Section 230’s immunity to an “affirmative defense … that an interactive computer service provider has a burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence,” defendants could no longer use Section 230 to dismiss cases at the beginning of a suit and would be required to prove—with evidence—that Section 230 applies. Right now, Section 230 saves companies and users significant legal costs when they are subjected to frivolous lawsuits. With this change, even if the defendant ultimately prevails against a plaintiff’s claims, they will have to defend themselves in court for longer, driving up their costs.The increased legal costs of even meritless lawsuits will have serious consequences for users’ speech. An online service that cannot quickly get out of frivolous litigation based on user-generated content is likely going to take steps to prevent such content from becoming a target of litigation in the first place, including screening user’s speech or prohibiting certain types of speech entirely. And in the event that someone upset by a user’s speech sends a legal threat to an intermediary, the service is likely to be much more willing to remove the speech—even when it knows the speech cannot be subject to legal liability—just to avoid the new, larger expense and time to defend against the lawsuit.As a result, the SAFE Tech Act would open the door for a host of new suits that by design are not filed to vindicate a legal wrong but simply to remove certain speech from the Internet—also called SLAPP lawsuits. These would remove a much greater volume of speech that does not, in fact, violate the law. Large services may find ways to absorb these new costs. But for small intermediaries and growing platforms that may be competing with those large companies, a single costly lawsuit, even if the defendant small company eventually prevails, may be the difference between success and failure. This is not to mention the many small businesses who use social media to market their company or service to respond to (and moderate) comments on their pages or sites, and who would likely be in danger of losing immunity from liability under this change. The SAFE Tech Act also modifies Section 230’s immunity in another significant way, by permitting aggrieved individuals to seek non-monetary relief from platforms whose content has harmed them. Under the bill, Section 230 would not apply when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to require an online service to remove or restrict user-generated content that is “likely to cause irreparable harm.” The SAFE Tech Act’s injunctive relief carveout fails to account for how the provision will be misused to suppress lawful speech.This extremely broad change may be designed to address a legitimate concern about Section 230. Some people who are harmed online simply want the speech taken down instead of seeking monetary compensation. While giving certain Internet users an effective remedy that they currently lack under 230, the SAFE Tech Act’s injunctive relief carveout fails to account for how the provision will be misused to suppress lawful speech.The SAFE Tech Act’s language appears to permit enforcement of all types of injunctive relief at any stage in a case. Litigants often seek emergency and temporary injunctive relief at an extremely early stage of the case, and judges frequently grant it without giving the speaker or platform an opportunity to respond. Courts already issue these kinds of takedown orders against online platforms, and they are prior restraints in violation of the First Amendment. If Section 230 does not bar these types of preliminary takedown orders, plaintiffs are likely to misuse the legal system to force down legal content without a final adjudication about the actual legality of the user-generated content.Also, the injunctive relief carveout could be abused in another type of case, known as a default judgment, to remove speech without any judicial determination that the content is illegal. Default judgments are when the defendant does not fight the case, allowing the plaintiff to win without any examination of the underlying merits. In many cases, defendants avoid litigation simply because they don’t have the time or money for it. Because of its one-sided nature, default judgments are subject to great fraud and abuse. Others have documented the growing phenomenon of fraudulent default judgments, typically involving defamation claims, in which a meritless lawsuit is crafted for the specific purpose of getting a default judgment and to avoid a consideration of its merits. If the SAFE Tech Act were to become law, fraudulent lawsuits like these would be incentivized and become more common, because Section 230 would no longer provide a barrier against their use to legally compel intermediaries to remove lawful speech.A recent Section 230 case called Hassel v. Bird illustrates how a broad injunctive relief carveout to the law that would apply to default judgments would incentivize censorship of protected user speech. In Hassel, a lawyer sued a user of Yelp (Bird) who gave her law office a bad review, claiming defamation. The court never ruled on whether the speech was defamatory, but because the reviewer did not defend the lawsuit, the trial judge entered a default judgment against the reviewer, ordering the removal of the post.  Section 230 prevented a court from ordering Yelp to remove the post. Despite the potential for litigants to abuse the SAFE Tech Act’s injunctive relief carveout, the bill contains no guardrails for online intermediaries hosting legitimate speech targeted for removal. As it stands, the injunctive relief exception to Section 230 poses a real danger to legitimate speech. This only scratches the surface of the SAFE Tech Act. But the bill’s shotgun approach to amending Section 230, and the broadness of its language, make it impossible to support as it stands. If legislators take issue with deceptive advertisers, they should use existing laws to protect users from them. Instead of making sweeping changes to Section 230, they should update antitrust law to stop the flood of mergers and acquisitions that have made competition in Big Tech an illusion, creating much of the problems we see in the first place. If they want to make Big Tech more responsive to the concerns of consumers, they should pass a strong consumer data privacy law with a robust private right of action.If they disagree with the way that large companies like Facebook benefit from Section 230, they should carefully consider that changes to Section 230 will mostly burden smaller platforms and entrench the large companies that can absorb or adapt to the new legal landscape (large companies continue to support amendments to Section 230, even as those companies simultaneously push back against substantive changes that actually seek to protect users, and therefore harm their bottom line). Addressing Big Tech’s surveillance-based business models can’t, and shouldn’t, be done through amendments to Section 230—but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done at all. It’s absolutely a problem that just a few tech companies wield such immense control over what speakers and messages are allowed online. And it’s a problem that those same companies fail to enforce their own policies consistently or offer users meaningful opportunities to appeal bad moderation decisions. But this bill would not create a fairer system.

The Starlink beta is already covering several US counties up in the northwestStarlink is a fledgling satellite-based internet service, headed by Tesla founder Elon Musk. It plans to shirk the rather poor reputation of satellite internet and provide meaningful service.While it doesn't stand to make too much of a difference for urban and suburban areas, Starlink could be a huge boon for rural communities. It's currently in beta with no data cap. And now we have an indication of where coverage is during this initial rollout.PCMag received exclusive speed test data from Ookla, detailing where exactly Starlink users are at the moment. The company located US counties with at least 30 Starlink users in them, counting from December. It then compared Starlink speeds to the other more traditional ISPs in those areas.With satellite internet, there's a fixed amount of satellites and therefore a set number of people who can access them. Although rural communities stand to gain the most from the service, Ookla found a surprising amount of Starlink beta testers in Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis (where there are faster ISPs available).""I'm not surprised to see a massive demand for Starlink Internet,"" said Shrihari Pandit, president and CEO of Stealth Communications, a New York City-based fiber gigabit internet services company, in an email interview with Tom's Guide. ""Users experience with telco/cable company's speeds and reliability leave something to be desired, even in NYC!""Elon Musk said that Starklink will target the more northern parts of the country along the Canada border. Washington state has the most users according to Ookla, but there are quite a few in the Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California (where the SpaceX and Tesla headquarters are). A smaller number of users reside in Canyon County, Idaho, Cook County, Illinois, and Berrien County, Michigan.“Based on Starlink's current satellite and ground-station deployment,  their highest link-availability (uptime) is limited to the Northern portion of the United States in this initial phase,"" said Pandit. ""As additional satellites and orbital planes come online, we will see southern locations open up to beta later this year. It will result in improved performance, link availability, and most importantly, the ability for Starlink to handle larger amount of  concurrent users for a geographical area.""Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Thank you for signing up to Tom's Guide.

Twitter's new Super Followers feature to give users a chance to a make profit,Social Media,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/02/25/twitter-super-follows-let-users-charge-premium-posts/6824514002/,"Twitter is hatching plans for a new pay-to-follow model where users could get exclusive content from some of the platform's most influential accounts for a fee.The social media company said Thursday it is working on a new feature called ""Super Followers,"" which will allow users to subscribe to their favorite Twitter accounts for content going beyond the usual tweets. This potentially could be anything from newsletters to videos from high-profile users.Think of pop star Justin Bieber, who has 114 million followers on Twitter (second only to former president Barack Obama's nearly 130 million followers), performing a private concert or releasing new music for a fee. A subscription fee could be as much as $4.99 per month, according to screenshots provided by Twitter. However, the company may allow users to customize their own subscription costs. Twitter's head of consumer product Kayvon Beykpour said the Super Followers feature will be available later this year.Dantley Davis, Twitter's chief design officer said that ""an audience-funded model where subscribers can directly fund the content that they value most is a durable incentive model that aligns the interests of creators and consumers.""The feature echoes creator payment platforms like Patreon similar features made by Facebook and YouTube. Twitter's head of consumer product Kayvon Beykpour later said the Super Followers feature will be available later this year.The announcement came during Twitter's first virtual Analyst Day event, where analysts and investors press Twitter executives about their forecast for the upcoming year. The company also said Thursday that it projects to double its annual revenue from 3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion in 2023 as well as boosting daily user growth from its current 192 million to 315 million in the next two years.More:Trump allies banned from Twitter still spreading QAnon, election fraud conspiracies thereFacebook says it cracked down on climate change lies:Then came false power outage claim during Texas winter stormAdditionally, Twitter also announced another soon-to-be released feature called Communities where users can create and join groups around specific topics and interests that could be a competitor with Facebook's popular Groups feature. ""We're focused on public conversation as a use case, and that use case is going to have multiple formats associated with it,"" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said.  While the new features are intended to create revenue and growth, the company continues to face scrutiny with the persistent harassment and hateful rhetoric on the platform. The company said Thursday that it is using more ""machine learning-based"" automated technology to enforce its rules.Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's chief legal officer, told the analysts and investors that as human communication continues to evolve in many forms, ""so too will technology."" ""This technology isn't perfect and never will be,"" Gadde said.

438,Deplatforming Works: Alex Jones says getting banned by YouTube and Facebook will only make him stronger. The research says that's not true.,Social Media,https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjbp9d/do-social-media-bans-work,"The dust is still settling after Alex Jones’s InfoWars was more-or-less simultaneously banned by YouTube, Spotify, Apple, and Facebook. The move has spawned thousands of takes about whether deplatforming Jones was the right move or a slippery slope toward more censorship. But just as important to consider: Will it work?This is called ""deplatforming"" or ""no platform,""—social media companies (sans Twitter, which says he hasn’t broken its rules) have decided to stop being complicit in spreading Jones’s conspiracy theories and hate. And we’ve seen no indication Jones will stop. But will his business remain viable and will his influence wane?The knee-jerk reaction, among Jones and some parts of the conservative movement, is that banning Jones will only make him stronger. InfoWars noted (correctly) that “Google searches for ‘InfoWars’ skyrocket after tech purge,” and added that Silicon Valley’s “censorship campaign backfires as interest in InfoWars goes through the roof.” The Ringer, meanwhile, noted that “the paradox of Alex Jones, Infowars, the alt-right, and this whole unfortunate orbit of web-taught, forum-dwelling eugenicists: They are nothing without YouTube, and yet they’re nothing without getting banned, dramatically, from YouTube (or wherever else).”It’s true that Silicon Valley’s lethargy on the far-right, aided by endless press coverage, helped amplify their message and turned the far right into a real, powerful political force in the United States. And the “Streisand Effect” is definitely a real thing: Trying to censor something—even if that censorship is warranted—is only going to drive interest in it.But the belief among people who have studied deplatforming is that, in the long term, it does work, though it may have some unintended consequences that have not been fully understood yet.“We’ve been running a research project over last year, and when someone relatively famous gets no platformed by Facebook or Twitter or YouTube, there's an initial flashpoint, where some of their audience will move with them” Joan Donovan, Data and Society’s platform accountability research lead, told me on the phone, “but generally the falloff is pretty significant and they don’t gain the same amplification power they had prior to the moment they were taken off these bigger platforms.”There’s not a ton of research on this, but the work that has been done so far is promising. A study published by researchers at Georgia Tech last year found that banning the platform's most toxic subreddits resulted in less hate speech elsewhere on the site, and especially from the people who were active on those subreddits.Early results from Data and Society sent to an academic listserv in 2017 noted that it’s “unclear what the unintended effects of no platforming will be in the near and distant future. Right now, this can be construed as an incredibly positive step that platforms are making in responding to public complaints that their services are being used to spread hate speech and further radicalize individuals. However, there could be other unintended consequences. There has already been pushback on the right about the capacity and ethics of technology companies making these decisions. We’ve also seen an exodus towards sites like Gab.ai and away from the more mainstream social media networks. ”There are lots of examples of people who have been deplatformed and have seen their power wane. After he lost his Fox News show, Glenn Beck couldn’t sustain his influence—The Blaze reaches only a fraction of the people he used to. Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart personality, was permanently banned from Twitter for inciting targeted harassment campaigns against actress Leslie Jones, and he resigned from Breitbart over comments he made about pedophilia on a podcast. His general prominence in public discourse has waned ever since.“I think the anecdotes are what makes a difference here—each individual, when you add them up, you get a net effect. You don’t need much data behind it to point out that with Milo, he lost Twitter, and the result was he lost a lot,” Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, which monitors conservative media and is studying deplatforming, told me on the phone. “He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence.”Deepfakes, the AI-assisted technology used to create fake celebrity porn, grew in popularity after Motherboard reported on it. When Reddit, Pornhub, Gfycat, and others banned it, there were brief cries of “censorship,” and a brief spike in interest. But today, deepfakes are only being made and shared on the margins, in private forums and smaller, 4chan-like image boards.""Yes, we must take away the kinds of coordinative power they’re able to gain on platforms""One of the most important things to keep in mind when predicting what may happen to InfoWars is to consider how most people consume media these days. These platforms are so powerful for a reason: the vast majority of Americans use them every single day, and many people use social media as their only source of news. Social media is designed to be habit forming and many thousands of hours of research have been put into making sure these platforms are a daily habit; the question is whether Alex Jones and InfoWars is going to remain a daily habit after the initial Streisand Effect spike.“A lot of Jones’s programming is impromptu, where he’s doing emergency broadcasts drunk in his house at 1 AM,” Carusone said. “Without YouTube’s push notifications or algorithms, there’s no way anyone would be watching that.”Of course, getting banned from his major platforms won’t make Jones disappear, just like it hasn’t made Milo or Beck completely disappear. As platforms have begun to ban certain types of content, alternative platforms like Gab.ai and Voat have popped up, where more-or-less anything goes. These platforms, too, were hyped as potentially powerful alternatives to the big social media players, but are largely struggling and arguably no more relevant than standard message boards that have been used by the far-right to organize for decades.Nonetheless, the concern among academics is that, as hate moves to the darker corners of the internet, that some of their old followers may move with them and become further radicalized.“The good that comes with deplatforming is, their main goal was to redpill or get people within mainstream communities more in line with their beliefs, so we need to get them off those platforms,” Robyn Caplan, a PhD student at Rutgers University and Data and Society affiliate, told me on the phone. “But now we’ve put them down into their holes where they were before, and they could strengthen their beliefs and become more extreme.”The question is whether it’s more harmful to society to have many millions of people exposed to kinda hateful content or to have a much smaller number of ultra-radicalized true believers.Donovan believes that, ultimately, it’s important to deplatform people when their rhetoric is resulting in negative, real-world consequences: “The way Jones activates his audiences has implications for people who have already been victimized,” she said. “We have always had groups of white supremacists, misogynists, and violent insurrectionists joining message boards. But social media has made these tools much more powerful. So yes, we must take away the kinds of coordinative power they’re able to gain on platforms.”""Alex Jones is not the only person being deplatformed or who has been deranked""There are a couple other things worth mentioning. First, Jones has been deplatformed before, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when he lost his radio shows. Jones was able to build something of a dedicated, organic audience long before YouTube in part by executive producing and distributing the 9/11 conspiracy theory documentary Loose Change. InfoWars was streaming video on its own website before it was streaming on YouTube. He is nothing if not persistent.Second, the people who will stay on YouTube but won’t follow Jones are not suddenly going to be earnestly consuming the New York Times. Jones became popular on social media because he was vitriolic, and because social media algorithms favor vitriolic, high-velocity content.“Not only did Jones threaten and pantomime shooting Robert Mueller, the reason he did is because he said Mueller’s a ‘demon,’” Carusone said. “If you’re already plugged into the ‘demon’ algorithm on YouTube, there’s plenty of other people spewing demon stuff for you there.”Most importantly, we need to remember that Jones’s banning, and to a lesser extent Milo’s, only became major national news because it fits into a false narrative that Silicon Valley censors only conservatives, which has been posited by Ted Cruz, Congressman Jim Jordan, and, recently, Donald Trump.Deplatforming works “best” when the people being deplatformed don’t have any power to begin with. Nor are we talking about people from marginalized communities who have self-censored or left social media because of far right harassment and hate campaigns (and could, in theory, come back with more proactive moderation by large platforms.)“Alex Jones is not the only person being deplatformed or who has been deranked,” Caplan said. “We need to puncture this myth that it’s only affecting far-right people. Trans rights activists, Black Lives Matter organizers, LGBTQI people have been demonetized or deranked. The reason we’re talking about far-right people is that they have coverage on Fox News and representatives in Congress holding hearings. They already have political power.”"
439,"Despite Nvidia's Anti-Mining Lock, RTX 3060 Can Still Earn Up To $7 a Day Mining - ""it will still happily mine other coins""",Hardware,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-3060-still-profitable-mining,"
By

19 February 2021
Is it all just a complicated PR stunt?Yesterday, Nvidia announced that the RTX 3060 would limit hashing power when it detected Ethereum mining, but Nvidia was oddly specific about Ethereum. That made us wonder: What about other coins? After all, Ethereum isn't the only crypto coin out there, and new coins and algorithms come out on a regular basis.As it turns out, we were right to wonder about this. The RTX 3060 implements vBIOS and driver protections to detect when it is mining Ethereum. But as found by YouTuber CryptoLeo, it will still happily mine other coins, as if it has no idea that it's still mining coins at full power... because... well... it doesn't know better.Leo tested a Pre-NDA RTX 3060 GPU with coins such as Octopus, Cortex, and a handful more, and found that with the first two the GPU is still able to generate about $6.5 in profits per day... which is enough to still make it attractive to miners, and not what gamers were hoping for.Of course, these coins aren't as popular as Ethereum due to overall lower profitability, so it makes sense that Nvidia targeted Ethereum coin mining with the hashing limiter. But it makes you wonder: Was it all just a complicated PR stunt to regain some popularity with gamers?Of course, we're all asking ourselves the same question, but the solution isn't quite that simple. Creating a general limiting algorithm for when crypto-mining behavior is detected is harder than one would think for one simple reason: How do you make it distinguish between coin mining and other non-gaming GPU workloads that can look like mining, such as machine learning, cryptography, or graphical work with Adobe products? Maybe that last one is easier, but GPUs are fully programmable for a reason.As a result, if the Ethereum protocol were to change even slightly, for example, the update to Ethereum 2.0 with the new Proof-of-Stake mining model, the entire mining limiter would likely cease to be useful. But that's still quite a ways away, so the main issue, for now, remains other profitable coins and the risk of someone finding a workaround for the in-vBIOS detection.We're scratching our heads about how well the measure will be useful to limiting the RTX 3060's appeal to miners. I suppose we'll have to wait and see to find out. The RTX 3060 is slated to launch on the 25th of February for $329 — but we all know it's going to cost a lot more than that, especially if miners do set their sights on it. The Ampere GPUs were already selling out faster than Nvidia could make them before the recent surge in mining profitability, and the underlying problem (not enough supply) isn't going away any time soon.Get instant access to breaking news, in-depth reviews and helpful tips.Thank you for signing up to Tom's Hardware.

440,Technology Is Just A Tool: Why People Are The Heart Of Everything We Do In Business,ADBLOCK WARNING,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/26/technology-is-just-a-tool-why-people-are-the-heart-of-everything-we-do-in-business/?sh=22f0784d4821,"Steve Durbin is Chief Executive of Information Security Forum. He is a frequent speaker on the Board's role in cybersecurity and technology.gettyThe idea that technology can solve all our problems is seductive. It seems like every product vendor claims to have a silver bullet for whatever ails your organization, and we’re all looking for a quick fix. However, I believe the danger is that we can become overly fixated on software and artificial intelligence to solve our problems. I've found this belief in technology to be particularly strong in cybersecurity, but most industries have embraced digital transformation. While technology undoubtedly has a role to play, it must go hand in hand with people.Every product and service we create is ultimately built to serve people. Technology can empower us in many ways, and it can be an incredibly useful multifaceted tool, but it is just a tool; it needs a person to wield it effectively. Deep insights, creative sparks and relevant perspectives come from people. We need to take a moment to step back and remember that everything we do is not technology-related but people-related because people are at the heart of it.Taking A New Approach To The Skills ShortageThe skills shortage has long been a hot topic in security. Experience is at a premium, but there’s a shortage of experienced people with the right technical skill sets. This experience problem is a bit like the chicken and the egg. Perhaps we’re looking in the wrong place. We’re focused on the shortage of experienced individuals who've been through the security processes, who understand how to respond to a breach, who can do all the network configurations and security modeling that's required. But is that what we need?From my perspective, we might benefit more by bringing people who already possess other skills that are in short supply within security through the different levels. The challenge that security faces is how to remain relevant and add value to the business. Why not take people who understand how a business functions, such as people from sales and marketing, and support them in acquiring some of the security skills we seek?The truth is that it’s very difficult to train somebody in the softer, emotionally intelligent skills that security professionals need to be effective in their roles. Why not do it the other way around?We also need to embrace diversity because through inclusion, we get a fresh set of insights and perspectives on every problem. The most effective teams include a mix of genders and cultural backgrounds. Organizations are operating in a global environment, and they need a workforce that reflects that.Enabling People To Do Their BestInvesting in people will always pay dividends. Technology is there to help people do a better job. Where possible, it shoulders some of the heavy lifting on monotonous tasks so people are freed up to collaborate, be creative and innovate. Good management will always look for ways to facilitate the workforce, energize them and remove obstacles to their success.The pandemic has completely broken this old-fashioned notion that for a corporation to be effective, everybody has to be under the same roof. We’re no longer asking people to spend three hours a day commuting to and from work. I predict that few organizations will go back to five days a week in the office (and many workers might even be less stressed as a result). It could open up opportunities for people who have been unable to travel or relocate. The potential recruitment pool just got much wider.While there are challenges in securing this new landscape, there’s also a lot of opportunities. A key part of this is making it count when people do get together. It’s madness to ask someone to come into an office and then have them sit and do something they could have done at home, but face-to-face collaboration is crucial for success.Collaborating: Where The Real Magic Happens Technology is useful, but when people come together to decide how they're going to use the tools for improvement, differentiation or transformation, that’s where things get really exciting. By reimagining traditional offices as collaboration centers, we can get more value from the limited time people spend together. They may come to the office once a week or once a month; the important thing is to make space for people to come to feed off one another — in a comfortable environment where they can share ideas.I believe the interactions you would get in these environments could be so much richer and better because people would be there for the right reason. They're not just there because they have to be. Free of this arbitrary requirement, the daily drudgery of the commute and the grueling office workweek, people can bring enthusiasm and excitement to the table and collaborate to generate fresh, innovative thinking that can drive your organization forward.Of course, technology will always have an important role to play, but it’s there to serve and facilitate the real heart of every organization: its people.Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

441,Virginia's Weak Privacy Bill Is Just What Big Tech Wants,Politics,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/virginias-weak-privacy-bill-just-what-big-tech-wants,"Virginia’s legislature has passed a bill meant to protect consumer privacy—but the bill, called the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, really protects the interests of business far more than the interests of everyday consumers.Take ActionVirginia: Speak Up for Real PrivacyThe bill, which both Microsoft and Amazon supported, is now headed to the desk of Governor Ralph Northam. This week, EFF joined with the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Consumer Federation of America, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, U.S. PIRG to ask for a veto on this bill, or for the governor to add a reenactment clause—a move that would send the bill back to the legislature to try again.If you’re in Virginia and care about true privacy protections, let the governor know that the VCDA doesn’t give consumers the protections they need. In fact, it stacks the deck against them, by offering an “opt-out” framework that doesn’t protect privacy by default, allowing companies to force consumers that exercise their privacy rights to pay higher prices or accept a lower quality of service, and offering no meaningful enforcement—making it very unlikely that consumers will be able to hold companies to account if any of the few rights this bill grants them are violated. As passed by the legislature, the bill is set to go into effect in 2023 and will establish a working group to make improvements between now and then. That offers some chance for improvements—but it likely won’t be enough to get real consumer protections. As we noted in a joint press release, “These groups appreciate that Governor Northam’s office has engaged with the concerns of consumer groups and committed to a robust stakeholder process to improve this bill. Yet the fundamental problems with the CDPA are too big to be fixed after the fact.”Consumer privacy rights must be the foundation of any real privacy bill. The CDPA was written without meaningful input from consumer advocates; in fact, as Protocol reported, it was handed to the bill’s sponsor by an Amazon lobbyist. Some have suggested the Virginia bill could be a model for other states or for federal legislation. That’s bad for Virginia and bad for all of us.Virginians, it’s time to take a stand. Tell Governor Northam that this bill is not good enough, and urge him to veto it or send it back for another try.  TAKE ACTIONVIRGINIA: SPEAK UP FOR REAL PRIVACYThe third-party cookie is dying, and Google is trying to create its replacement.

TikTok on Wednesday agreed to pay $92 million to settle claims stemming from a class-action lawsuit alleging the app illegally tracked and shared the personal data of users without their consent.TikTok has agreed to pay $92 million to settle dozens of lawsuits alleging that the popular video-sharing app harvested personal data from users, including information using facial recognition technology, without consent and shared the data with third-parties, some of which were based in China.The proposed settlement, which lawyers in the case have called among the largest privacy-related payouts in history, applies to 89 million TikTok users in the U.S. whose personal data was allegedly tracked and sold to advertisers in violation of state and federal law. ""First, it provides compensation for TikTok users, but equally as important, it ensures TikTok will respect its users' privacy going forward,"" Katrina Carroll, one of the lawyers for TikTok users, said. ""Social media seems so innocuous, but troubling data collection, storage, and disclosure can happen behind the scenes.""The settlement is the result of 21 federal lawsuits filed mostly on behalf of  minors — some as young as 6 years old — that claimed the company engaged in the ""theft of private and personally identifiable TikTok user data."" A TikTok spokesperson said while the company disagrees with the assertions in the lawsuit, the company decided settling the case was in its best interest. ""Rather than go through lengthy litigation, we'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,"" the spokesperson said. The legal battle has raged for more than a year. The suits were merged into one multi-district action in the Northern District of Illinois that cited violations of privacy laws in Illinois and California. The laws require technology companies to receive written consent before collecting data about a person's identity. The suit also claimed TikTok broke federal laws, including privacy and computer fraud and abuse statutes.According to lawyers representing TikTok users, the app ""clandestinely vacuumed up"" vast quantities of private and personally identifiable data that could be used to identify and surveil users without permission. Even information from draft videos that were never shared publicly on the app were mined by TikTok for data, the lawyers for the users alleged. As millions in the U.S. turned to the app for videos of dance challenges, cooking tips and silly skits, TikTok was allegedly sending their information to servers in China, or in other countries where China-based employees could access the data.  Tiktok also shared information about users, without their consent, with Facebook, Google and other companies, the suit claims.  ""The TikTok app's lighthearted fun comes at a heavy cost,"" plaintiffs' lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Investigators hired by the plaintiffs' lawyers found that TikTok went to great lengths to hide the data collection and sharing practices.""Plaintiffs' investigation has revealed that [TikTok did so] by obfuscating the source code that would reveal their misconduct,"" according to the suit. The tentative settlement awaits final approval by U.S. District Judge John Lee of the Northern District of Illinois. Under the proposed terms of the settlement, TikTok will no longer record a user's biometric information, including facial characteristics, nor track a user's location using GPS data. TikTok also committed to stop sending U.S. users data overseas and the app said it would no longer collect data on draft videos before the content is published. Former President Donald Trump clamped down on TikTok over its ties to China. The app is owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance. TikTok has long maintained that authorities in China cannot access U.S. user data, which is controlled by an American-led team. The Biden administration has pulled back from its predecessor's crackdown on TikTok, instead launching a broader review of Americans' use of Chinese technology.That said, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group led by the Treasury Department that probes companies with overseas connections, is in the midst of a national security review of TikTok that may force changes to the company's corporate structure. The proposed TikTok settlement announced on Wednesday follows a similar deal struck last year in which Facebook paid $650 million to resolve legal claims over collecting and storing biometric data of millions of users. Federal regulators have scrutinized TikTok's data collection practices of minors. In February 2019, TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission over allegations the app illegally collected personal information from children.

443,Fry’s Electronics is officially going out of business after 36 years,Business,https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/24/frys-electronics-out-of-business/,"February 24

								@ChanceHMillerIt’s the end of an era for technology fans: After nearly 36 years, Fry’s Electronics has officially confirmed that it is going out of business and closing all of its stores nationwide. The company has also completely shut down its online store and replaced it with a goodbye message.
In the announcement message, Fry’s explains that it has made the decision to shutter its operations as a result of “changes in the retail industry and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.” The company is planning a “wind-down process” that it believes best serves its various stakeholders.While some locations had already closed, the company will close its remaining 31 stores, which span nine different states. The news was first reported by San Francisco outlet KRON4.After nearly 36 years in business as the one-stop-shop and online resource for high-tech professionals across nine states and 31 stores, Fry’s Electronics, Inc. (“Fry’s” or “Company”), has made the difficult decision to shut down its operations and close its business permanently as a result of changes in the retail industry and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company will implement the shut down through an orderly wind down process that it believes will be in the best interests of the Company, its creditors and other stakeholders.As a family-owned business, Fry’s was once an institutional part of the retail space, offering massive stores filled with any piece of technology you might need. But, as anyone who has visited a Fry’s in the last few years knows, the writing has been on the wall. The company has struggled to adapt to the changing retail industry with pressure from the likes of Amazon and even Best Buy.Fry’s had attempted to pivot by offering aggressive price-matching campaigns and expanding beyond technology and electronics, but those efforts ultimately proved fruitless. A variety of tweets and videos over the last year further showcased the barren shelves at many Fry’s locations.The Verge has some additional details on what the retailers has been up to, noting that the company had switched to a consignment model:It turned out the company had been forced to switch to a consignment model, only able to attract suppliers willing to get paid for their goods after Fry’s managed to sell them. Many suppliers weren’t. A former employee tells the Verge that Samsung stopped doing business due to unpaid bills, and that Fry’s had eliminated most full-time roles even before the pandemic hit, in order to save money.As anyone who was a Fry’s shopper years ago will tell you, visiting the store was always an experience for technology fans.

444,The Terrible T-Mobile/Sprint Merger Must Be Undone,Business,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-terrible-t-mobilesprint-merger-must-be-undone/,"To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Hal SingerTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Donald Trump’s Antitrust Division was not particularly skilled at market design. In February 2020, it convinced a judge to wave through the  T-Mobile/Sprint merger, under the belief—a prayer really—that the merged firm could be forced to breathe life into a nascent rival, Dish, and that the rival would invest billions in its own network. This was like trading a first-round pick in the draft for an aging journeyman with an incurable knee injury.Never mind that this experiment of using a reseller as “fixer” for a wireless merger that reduced four competitors to three had stumbled in Germany, revealing the critical role of a fourth facilities-based provider in preserving competitive outcomes. Disregard that the merged firm would have a strong incentive to undermine the behavioral remedy. And ignore the long history of failed behavioral remedies in horizontal mergers documented by an antitrust luminary. Basically forget all accumulated relevant antitrust experience.Hal Singer is managing director at Econ One and an adjunct professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business.What seemed merely dangerous in foresight has been revealed to be outright dumb in hindsight: The behavioral remedy conceived by the Department of Justice to offset the loss in competition from the T-Mobile/Sprint merger is proving to be a failure. And wireless prices—perhaps coincidentally—are on the rise for the first time in over a decade (save for a minor uptick in 2016). If this trade were engineered by a general manager of a basketball team, they would be fired.In July 2019, the DOJ filed a complaint that spelled out the merger-related harms. It acknowledged that US wireless consumers “have benefited from the competition T-Mobile and Sprint have brought to the mobile wireless industry,” including the introduction of unlimited data plans to retail customers in 2016, and it concluded that “if the merger were allowed to proceed, this competition would be lost.”To remedy these clear harms, the parties agreed to structural and behavioral changes. Dish paid $1.4 billion for Boost and other Sprint prepaid assets. The behavioral remedy contemplated that T-Mobile would lease network access to Dish for seven years, while Dish built its own network. The settlement also required T-Mobile and Sprint to provide certain “transition services” to Dish for up to three years, including billing, customer care, and SIM card procurement. If Dish’s own network does not serve 70 percent of the country by 2023, it will face penalties of up to $2.2 billion.On an investor call this week, Dish’s chairman, Charlie Ergen, acknowledged that T-Mobile was not playing nice. T-Mobile is shutting down its older wireless network that supports Dish’s Boost customers. The majority of Dish’s customers use T-Mobile’s 3G CDMA service, which means that Dish will lose those customers unless, among other things, they get a new device or a new SIM card. Dish revealed that this change would cause a significant disruption to its service and increase its churn rate. Ergen described T-Mobile’s decision to shut down the CDMA network as “anticompetitive.”To where might these departing Dish customers churn? By turning off this lifeline to Dish, T-Mobile can drive Boost customers back to T-Mobile, which should place upward pressure on the price that T-Mobile charges for prepaid plans. Dish already lost 363,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2020 (and another 212,000 the previous quarter), suggesting that the remedy was failing in more subtle ways prior to T-Mobile’s overtly “anticompetitive” act.DOJ’s remedy also naively assumed Dish itself would play nice. The idea was that Dish would grow and expand Boost, not just retrench and harvest cash flow as subscribers defected back to the three facilities-based carriers. Yet Moffett Nathanson analysts noted, “Dish looks focused on generating cash short-term by cutting costs and pulling back on subscriber acquisition while taking hits to its subscriber base—the same approach for its pay TV business.” During the trial, Ergen testified that he would grow Boost and that he didn’t need T-Mobile’s older 3G network. Relying on this and other testimony from business managers, the trial judge basically threw out the presumption of competitive harm.Dish’s opportunistic behavior was also predictable. As I explained in October 2019 alongside several economists, Dish’s maximum financial penalty for failing to build a national facilities-based network ($2.2 billion) is small compared to Dish’s estimated $10 billion in build-out costs. Indeed, the penalty is also small relative to what some think its spectrum holdings (FCC-assigned property rights, typically to winning bidders, to offer wireless service) could fetch if sold outright. To wit, the FCC’s recent spectrum auction fetched a whopping $81 billion, four times what was predicted. Accordingly, Dish has a strong incentive to avail itself of the resale crutch, making the minimum investment necessary, until it finds a savior to take the spectrum off its hands.Fortunately, antitrust agencies can revisit mergers that they approved, particularly when those mergers have revealed themselves to be anticompetitive. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission sued to unwind Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram, after initially blessing those mergers a decade ago. Under new leadership, the Antitrust Division could go back to court and acknowledge that its remedy was ill conceived. Antitrust lawyer Shaoul Sussman told me that there’s long-established legal precedent for such a move: The DOJ could simply seek to dissolve the previously approved decree.The Antitrust Division needs to unwind this trade. Wireless consumers, especially vulnerable customers in the prepaid segment, deserve better.WIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

So they didn't,Networking/Telecom,https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/states-couldnt-afford-to-wait-for-the-fccs-broadband-maps-to-improve-so-they-didnt/,"We and our partners use cookies to understand how you use our site, improve your experience and serve you personalized content and advertising. Read about how we use cookies and your choices here. By continuing to use this site, you accept these cookies.Georgia, Maine, Pennsylvania and others took mapping into their own hands, building their own granular data to pinpoint gaps in internet coverage and apply for federal funding.Three years ago, Georgia state officials knew they had a problem. The state needed federal funding to bring broadband to unserved parts, but no one knew where those gaps actually were. The US Federal Communications Commission maps weren't precise enough, and Georgia didn't have any of its own. So those officials decided to build their own maps.The state legislature formed the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative and passed a law that made it easier for service providers to share private, detailed information without tipping off competitors. Within two years, Georgia had built a map considered to be one of the most granular in the nation. And it didn't have to wait for the flawed national broadband map to catch up. By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.""We took the approach of getting [data] more at an address- or a location-level approach to get a better understanding,"" said Deana Perry, executive director of the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative. ""The publication of the map has been very beneficial,"" she added, in supporting efforts to get students connected during the novel coronavirus pandemic, to help expand access to low-income housing and to get people access to doctors through telemedicine -- all areas that are vital as the pandemic continues to ravage the country. The effort by Georgia officials -- taking it upon themselves to solve a problem that's plagued the federal government for decades -- underscores how some are starting to move with more urgency to solve the broadband gap. It's a problem that affects millions of Americans, and is particularly urgent in light of a pandemic that has forced most interactions, from classes to weddings, to go online.While the federal government works to allocate $20 billion on top of billions of dollars in funding already earmarked for unserved communities, there remains a lack of understanding of where the problems lie. The FCC's broadband map isn't detailed enough to pinpoint unserved areas, and that's left millions of Americans behind. Unless the data improves, service is unlikely to improve. The latest FCC data from January, which includes data provided through the end of 2019, determined that fewer than 14.5 million Americans -- or 4.4% of the population -- lack access to fixed broadband, which is defined as download speeds of 25 Mbps and upload speeds of 3 Mbps. But Microsoft, which looks at how quickly people across the US download its software and security updates, in December said 157.3 million people in the US, or 48% of the population, don't use the internet at broadband speeds. And broadband data tracker BroadbandNow a year ago estimated that at least 42 million, or 13% of the population, didn't have broadband at all, double the FCC's declaration at the time.   The flawed maps present a big problem as the government tries to distribute broadband funding. If a census block is considered covered by the FCC map, it's not eligible for federal assistance. It's proved to be an issue as the US allocates billions through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, or RDOF, which the FCC has called its ""largest investment ever to close [the] digital divide.""Thanks to $65 million in funding from Congress in December, the FCC now will require internet service providers to share more detailed data, giving a better picture of what areas are unserved by broadband. It will also have to open the map to public feedback, letting people flag when something is wrong and providing more data points on gaps. Last week, acting FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel launched a new task force to fix the data, saying ""it's no secret that the FCC's existing broadband maps leave a lot to be desired.""But some experts say the new mapping parameters still aren't granular enough, and the new maps almost certainly will arrive too late to help people during the pandemic. States aren't waiting around for the FCC. That includes Georgia, Maine and Pennsylvania, which are building their own maps, as well as many other states around the nation. They're drawing on speed test data, specific information from ISPs about what homes they serve, and other resources to find out where their gaps are. ""The states are the ones who are innovating on this,"" says Peggy Schaffer, director of the ConnectMaine Authority, the state's effort to bridge its digital divide. ""We know we can't wait for the feds to fix it. We waited, we're done, so we're moving.""Those FCC maps are often too vague to be helpful. The agency collects what's called Form 477 data from internet service providers, which contain information about where ISPs say they can provide service within 10 business days. It's measured at the census block level -- the smallest geographic area used by the US Census Bureau -- and if only one home in a census block can get service, the whole block is considered served and isn't eligible for public funds. ISPs have long resisted sharing address-level data with the FCC, and still won't under the new plan. Instead, carriers will report on access based on regions called ""shapefiles."" The polygon shapefiles will be overlaid on census blocks to depict the areas where broadband-capable networks exist. Until the FCC publishes its new maps -- next year at the earliest -- it won't be clear whether those shapefiles are detailed enough to help. ""We saw so many folks just talk about shapefiles breathlessly, as if it was this magic technology that was going to solve everything,"" said Josh Stager, senior counsel at the Open Technology Institute, the tech arm of the New American Foundation think tank that pushes for policy and regulatory reforms. ""What matters is what's in the shapefile. What's the underlying data? How granular is it?""Georgia has built its own broadband maps using service provider data and address information from a real estate data company. The dark orange areas have broadband internet, the beige are unserved and gray areas are where there are no locations. Along with the full state view, Georgia offers a county broadband map. Even if a service provider actually shares address-level data, like in Georgia, there's still a gap in knowing what areas are uncovered. The Enhanced 911 database is typically used for mapping, but it contains information like addresses for barns or various other locations that aren't the top priority for connectivity. Few places have been able to put together a picture of what are addresses that actually need coverage, at least not on a large scale. Georgia is one of them. ""The Georgia broadband map is the most granular in the nation,"" Gigi Sohn, an FCC staffer from 2013 to 2016 under Chairman Tom Wheeler and current distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy, said in a speech in late January. Georgia officials realized they needed to find a way to know what addresses actually were homes, not post office boxes or structures where people don't live or work. During its first pilot, the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative program aimed to develop a statewide master address file by working with local governments. But officials quickly found ""that would take a very long time to develop,"" said Perry, the program's director. Instead, it turned to LightBox, a commercial real estate data provider that has data on all addresses in the United States. ISPs provided Georgia with information on the addresses they served, and the state then matched that with LightBox's data to identify locations that didn't have broadband. Georgia ""has what nobody else has, which is a map of exactly what [does have broadband], and equally important, how many structures do not have connectivity,"" LightBox CEO Eric Frank said.Those maps wouldn't have been possible without the participation of Georgia's ISPs. Service providers have long said they couldn't provide granular data because it would hurt them competitively and financially. But Georgia's Achieving Connectivity Everywhere Act, passed in 2018, requires that ISP data be kept confidential and not shared beyond its use in creating broadband maps. Competitors can't see a service provider's footprint, but consumers can see if their area is covered. The law ""gave them a level of comfort to want to participate"" in building Georgia's granular maps, Perry said. Ultimately, granular maps would help both parties. The state would know where gaps were and where to direct its funding. And the ISPs would get that funding to improve their networks. While Georgia has address-level data, what the public sees when it visits its map is an aggregated level of information that only goes as deep as the census block. But the state tweaked the FCC's definition of what an unserved census block would be. While the FCC's maps up to now require only one address to have access to service for a census block to be considered served, Georgia says a census block is only considered served if at least 80% of the addresses have access to broadband.  What Georgia ultimately found was 507,000 locations, or 10% of the state's homes and businesses, lack access to broadband. In rural areas, it's even worse with about 30% of locations unserved. The FCC, in its January report, said only 6.2% of Georgia locations didn't have broadband. More than a quarter million locations identified by Georgia were not considered by the FCC to be unserved, Perry said. ""Those locations would not be eligible for any FCC funding,"" she said. So now the state is exploring what resources are available to get those areas connected. Not all ISPs are comfortable sharing granular data with state and local governments, even if they're presented in an aggregated manner like in Georgia. In those places, governments are turning to another method of mapping to identify coverage gaps: speed tests. For states that don't have complete data from ISPs, one of the best options for mapping is crowdsourcing. Consumers can share what sort of coverage and speeds they have, typically through speed tests. Maine, Pennsylvania and others have worked with Measurement Lab (M-Lab) for its open, free tests. When someone Googles ""speed test,"" the box that appears at the top of the results is powered by M-Lab technology. The aim when setting up M-Lab over a decade ago was to show the FCC a prototype of how it could quickly and inexpensively use standard scientific research methodologies to derive a national broadband map, said Sascha Meinrath, a broadband data expert who serves as director of X-Lab, a future-focused technology policy and innovation think tank, and holds the endowed Palmer Chair in Telecommunications at Penn State University. Along with his role at the university, Meinrath co-founded M-Lab with Vint Cerf -- considered one of the founders of the internet -- and other researchers. While FCC maps in 2017 showed Pennsylvania was blanketed with broadband, more than 11 million speed tests conducted by Meinrath and his team in 2018 found no county where at least half of the population had access to broadband. And it's not just a Pennsylvania problem. Pennsylvania built detailed maps to help service providers apply for federal funding.""Our data is showing that 50% of the populace doesn't have access to broadband connectivity,"" not just in Pennsylvania but in the entire country, Meinrath said. ""Right now we're in this bizarre situation where even though we know -- we know -- that there's something dreadfully awry with our broadband [data collection], as a matter of national policy dating back 15 years, we simply refuse to collect the information that would explicate that,"" he added.Pennsylvania ended up putting together a statewide map to help providers apply for RDOF funding last year. Some ISPs shared confidential data with the map builders at Penn State, which they didn't publish on the broader map, and the commonwealth also relied on building data and download speed tests. It kept thd speed tests off its official map because of pushback from the service providers, said Harry Crissy, a Penn State University Extension agent for economic resource development who has worked on the commonwealth's broadband mapping efforts since December 2019. Pennsylvania published its map in April, and 13 service providers received $368.7 million in RDOF funds in December. ""We [released] it knowing there were flaws … but we did it specifically for providers because we wanted them to bid in that [RDOF] auction,"" Crissy said. Aside from getting funding, the maps are helping other groups identify gaps in connectivity. In August, the Pennsylvania Department of Education turned to Crissy's team for help identifying homes that didn't have internet service. It needed to find ways to get unserved students and teachers connected for remote classes. ""We turned that around in like four days for them,"" Crissy said. Crissy and Penn State have proposed creating a consortium of land grant and research universities for not only collecting data on broadband speed and providers but also tracking what it would cost to connect all unserved addresses in a census block. Clicking a block on a map would say something like, out of 85 households, 23 are served, and it would cost $60,000 to bring service to everyone else. ""What we've demonstrated in Pennsylvania is that. collaboration can really work,"" Crissy said. ""This is evolving really fast. Look at us in about 60 days, and you'll see what I mean.""Maine started looking at mapping in 2018, with state officials holding ""broadband boot camps"" to learn about the population's needs and to figure out the best way to put together maps that were better than those from the FCC. Eventually, it settled on pulling speed test data to find gaps in coverage. The state ran a pilot test in Oxford County in October to see how the process would work and went statewide with its plan on Thanksgiving week. Since then, nearly 17,000 people have taken its speed tests from over 13,000 unique locations. ""The speed tests do two things,"" Schaffer said. ""One is they give us better data, but two is it gives the community something to do."" The system automatically puts the speed tests on Maine's map, letting consumers immediately see some sort of result. ""Before we instituted this … they were just like screaming into the universe,"" she said. ""Now they can do something about it.""Maine is using speed test data to figure out where gaps exist in its broadband coverage. Since the week of Thanksgiving, residents of the state -- population 1.3 million -- have run nearly 17,000 tests.Speed tests aren't always that useful for address-specific data, but paint a picture of what an area looks like. ""It's not as important that it's accurate per household as it is you have a bunch of them in a period of time in an area that gives you a much better picture of what that area looks like,"" Schaffer said. By combining Maine's data and information from the FCC, the state estimates about 11% of the population, or about 85,000 homes, don't have broadband, or nearly triple the size of the FCC's tally. Maine plans to connect 95% of its population by 2025. Maine this month is opening its first grants for unserved areas based on its new mapping effort. One of the four possible ways to determine if an area can get funding is if speed tests show it doesn't have broadband. Georgia, meanwhile, benefited from its data's granularity even before its map went public. The information it possessed let officials respond quickly when the pandemic caused the state to shut down schools in March. Knowledge of what addresses didn't have home broadband allowed Georgia to figure out plans for deploying hotspots for students or finding other ways to get them connected. And it allowed schools to give their limited supplies of computers and other devices to students who would actually be able to use them. ""Within a week, we were able to bring seven different agencies together and were able to quickly share data … to see where students lack connectivity and understand what was the best way to deploy the solutions,"" Perry said. It's a model other states may want to follow as the nation waits for the FCC's broadband maps to improve."
446,How often should I rotate my ssh keys?,Security,https://tailscale.com/blog/rotate-ssh-keys/,"If you’re like most people, your answer to this is… “What? Why?”When ssh was introduced back in the 1990s, its appeal was simple. Passwords are too short, too guessable, too phishable, too often stored incorrectly, too MITM-able, too brute-forceable. Also its primary competition was rsh’s classic “no authentication,” but we don’t talk about that.Compared to that, ssh public-key authentication was a dream. Generate a keypair, don’t ever share the private key with anyone, and if an attacker ever steals your authorized_keys file, the joke’s on them, because all they can do with your public key is authorize you to break into their server. Suckers!It’s pretty great. And that greatness might lead you to wonder: why, then, 25 years after we learned this important lesson, are all the most secure websites on the Internet still using password authentication? Well, some good reasons, some not-so-good reasons. TLS client-side certs in web browsers have been tried many times and failed many times. That’s a story for another day.My story for today is about ssh and how even public keys, while much better than simple passwords, are still not a perfect solution.The danger is credential theft, which is a fancy way of saying “someone stole your private keys.” Back in the 1990s, that problem was pretty far from our minds; Windows 98 didn’t even have the concept of a separate administrator account, never mind the idea of app sandboxing or the inkling that someone might intentionally want to load malware onto your computer and encrypt all your files for ransomware. Those were the days when some people thought ActiveX controls (essentially loading .exe files from web sites) might be a good idea. Actually, maybe even a great idea as long as there was an “are you sure?” dialog box first.Come to think of it, how did anything ever work? What a time to be alive.Anyway, public key authentication was an amazingly advanced level of protection at the time. Normal people who used ssh keys didn’t have to worry much about attacks, because there were much easier targets: the run faster than the bear solution.Time has passed, though, and attackers are getting more advanced all the time, and some of the limits are starting to show.Here’s a story someone told me last year: one company had an employee they fired for bad behaviour. A few months later all their production servers got wiped out. They didn’t have enough forensics to identify how it happened, so they hired a consultant to help them reassemble it with a bit more logging for next time. A month later, it happened again! Everything gone.But this time they had logs. And what the logs showed is that one of their employees had ssh’d into all the servers and smashed everything. The employee, however, had logged in from some other country where the employee demonstrably wasn’t. And it didn’t seem like an employee who couldn’t be bothered to hide their login would have bothered to use a fake IP. What happened?What happened was that the rogue employee, months before they were fired, had waited until everyone went to lunch, walked around from one PC to the next, and collected the ssh private keys from any of them that weren’t locked. (Note in case you’re thinking of fixing this with a screen-locking policy: that’s not a bad start, but it’s not quite enough defense. Make sure to at least enable full-disk encryption on all your computers too, and you’re getting closer.) Then, a while after getting fired, he used a co-worker’s ssh key to login and destroy everything.When they rebuilt the server cluster after the first breach, they had been super careful, constructed all the servers from scratch, avoided any possibility of installed backdoors… and then promptly dropped in the same set of ssh public keys as before. Because ssh keys are secure, right? If there’s one thing we know for sure about security, it’s that. It’s even in the name!And they are secure, right up until they’re stolen. But the problem with static ssh keys is that if they are stolen, it’s undetectable. Many people avoid rotating their public keys for 10+ years. Someone might have stolen your private key 9 years ago, and is just waiting for the right moment to strike.Key rotation is the simple answer to this problem. Like forced password changes (which are out of vogue now), rotating your ssh keys protects, “eventually,” against key theft, which is a lot better than no protection at all. Of course, it has some of the disadvantages of password rotation too: notably, if you have your ssh private key on several machines, you have to remember to copy it to all those places. And if you have your ssh public key on many machines - which is the whole point - now you have to correctly delete the old one and add the new one. It’s a lot of tedious, error-prone work, which is why people don’t like to do it.An even more robust approach is to use some kind of hardware token that can sign short-lived ssh keys, and teach all your servers how to deal with those. That’s neat, but it’s hard to deploy (needs custom ssh settings). The deployment could be fixable - convince upstream ssh to do it in an easier way. But you still have the problem of the obnoxious hardware tokens, which then get into USB (which has too many connector types and mostly doesn’t work on a phone) or Bluetooth (which works maybe 97% of the time, which is simply not good enough for your emergency production login credentials).An easier approach is to set up an ssh jumphost, where you can contain your ssh fanciness to a single server (and even if you just use normal ssh keys, you only have to rotate them in that one place). This works pretty well, but creates added latency (the jumphost isn’t always near the server you want to jump to; or if you have a jumphost in every region, now you have to maintain a bunch of jumphosts), and of course, means that you have to do everything through ssh; you can’t route traffic directly.By the way, all these credential theft problems apply to more than just ssh: WireGuard and OpenVPN private keys can be stolen in the same ways, and are a liability unless you rotate them periodically.The approach we take in our own infrastructure, modeled after TLS certificate infrastructure and Let’s Encrypt in particular, is to authenticate each device+person combination with a separate private key; that way, if a credential is stolen, we always know from where. Each device can rotate that device-specific key as often as it wants, since the private key only lives in one place, and the public keys are all distributed rapidly from our coordination server to every other device that needs them. Because of this highly consistent key rotation (which is hard with ssh keys or passwords), we always know exactly when a particular keypair has been retired, once and for all, so we can always detect if that keypair makes a surprise reappearance: it must mean credential theft, which means a breach, which can trigger forensics. After all that, we hide our ssh keys behind this network-layer key rotation, which means that unrotated ssh keys are mostly harmless; only an authorized person with non-stolen credentials can even try to exploit a stolen ssh key.Anyway, back to our original question: how often should I rotate my ssh keys? More often than never! As often as you can. And make sure you retire old keys when you’re done with them.Product updates, blog posts, company news, and more.

447,Chromebooks' time has come,Hardware,https://www.theweek.in/theweek/leisure/2021/02/25/chromebooks-time-has-come.html,"Chromebooks, laptops powered by Google’s Chrome OS, have been around for a decade. But they mostly existed on the periphery of the laptop market. Last year, however, Chrome OS staged a coup of sorts by replacing Apple’s macOS as the second most popular computer operating system.Chrome OS had a 10.8 per cent market share in 2020, according to IDC, a consultancy that has been tracking trends. Interestingly, macOS's market share also grew from 6.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent in 2020. That means that Chrome OS grew at the expense of Microsoft Windows. Windows, however, remains the most popular operating system by far, with an 80.5 per cent share of the market.Schools and colleges had largely been the buyers of Chromebooks owing to the price factor. Then the pandemic hit, and Chromebooks became the first choice for those who wanted a second device for the homeschooled child or the working-from-home spouse. And there is a growing clientele of business users as well, thanks to some refined machines designed by Samsung, HP, Acer and Asus.Chrome OS is a web-based operating system. You do most things on a browser. After a slew of updates by Google, it can do most things that a PC or a Macbook does. And, it supports Android apps. There are catches, though. Programmes that are written for Windows and macOS do not work on Chromebooks.Against Macbooks, what Chromebooks offer is the substantial price advantage. The case is not as strong against PCs. But here is the deal. You can buy a nifty Chromebook for about Rs35,000. But you will get only a mediocre Windows machine for that money. And you know how mediocre Windows machines work.Copyright © 2021 All rights reserved"
448,Apple training Siri to detect and adapt to users who stutter using research and podcast catalog,Machine Learning,https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/25/apple-siri-stutter-detection/,"February 25

								@apollozacApple is investigating ways to enhance its Siri voice assistant for users with atypical speech patterns, the company confirms to the Wall Street Journal. According to the report, Apple is leveraging its podcast library for speech samples that could train Siri to adapt to users who speak with a stutter.
Here’s the news from the Wall Street Journal report:The company is now researching how to automatically detect if someone speaks with a stutter, and has built a bank of 28,000 audio clips from podcasts featuring stuttering to help do so, according to a research paper due to be published by Apple employees this week that was seen by the Wall Street Journal.For now, Apple relies on its Hold to Talk feature as a method for interacting with Siri without the voice assistant cutting off users with slower speech patterns than its tuned for, but physically interacting with a device isn’t always convenient. Siri can be voice activated on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and especially HomePod and HomePod mini, using the “Hey Siri” voice command followed by a request. For users who stutter, however, the current version of Siri commonly interprets pauses in speech as the end of a voice command. In turn, this prevents the voice assistant from reaching its full potential for a collection of customers.Friend of the site Steve Aquino pointed to the Apple research paper referenced in the WSJ report. As a lifelong stutter who is extraordinarily self-conscious about it, this @KatieDeighton story for the WSJ is huge news. Apple has done extensive research on this, as has Amazon and Google.  Apple research paper: https://t.co/DbJMSCv3duhttps://t.co/ScjNZMH5pt— Steven Aquino (@steven_aquino) February 25, 2021
Here’s the abstract for Apple’s research:The ability to automatically detect stuttering events in speech could help speech pathologists track an individual’s fluency over time or help improve speech recognition systems for people with atypical speech patterns. Despite increasing interest in this area, existing public datasets are too small to build generalizable dysfluency detection systems and lack sufficient annotations. In this work, we introduce Stuttering Events in Podcasts (SEP-28k), a dataset containing over 28k clips labeled with five event types including blocks, prolongations, sound repetitions, word repetitions, and interjections. Audio comes from public podcasts largely consisting of people who stutter interviewing other people who stutter. We benchmark a set of acoustic models on SEP-28k and the public FluencyBank dataset and highlight how simply increasing the amount of training data improves relative detection performance by 28% and 24% F1 on each. Annotations from over 32k clips across both datasets will be publicly released.The research paper acknowledged that the current approach to tuning Siri for dysfluency is one approach, there remains an opportunity to improve the effort using language models and other methods.Lastly, Apple concludes that while its current research focuses on users who stutter, future research should explore other categories like dysarthria that have different characteristics. Statement by Jane Fraser, President, the Stuttering Foundation on tech company efforts to include stuttering in speech patterns recognized by voice assistants:“We’re thrilled to learn of recent efforts by tech companies to be more inclusive of the stuttering community in their voice assistant technologies. For people who stutter, being heard and understood can be a lifelong struggle. The evolution of technology to account for what people say, rather than how they say it, opens the door for tens of millions of people who struggle with stuttering.”FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

449,From Creativity to Exclusivity: The German Government's Bad Deal for Article 17,Politics,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/creativity-exclusivity-german-governments-bad-deal-article-17,"The implementation process of Article 17 (formerly Article 13) of the controversial Copyright Directive into national laws is in full swing, and it does not look good for users' rights and freedoms. Several EU states have failed to present balanced copyright implementation proposals, ignoring the concerns off EFF, other civil society organizations, and experts that only strong user safeguards can help preventing Article 17 from turning tech companies and online services operators into copyright police.A glimpse of hope was presented by the German government in a recent discussion paper. While the draft proposal fails to prevent the use of upload filters to monitor all user uploads and assess them against the information provided by rightsholders, it showed creativity by giving users the option of pre-flagging uploads as ""authorized"" (online by default) and by setting out exceptions for everyday uses. Remedies against abusive removal requests by self-proclaimed rightsholders were another positive feature of the discussion draft.However, the recently adopted copyright implementation proposal by the German Federal Cabinet has abandoned the focus on user rights in favor of inflexible rules that only benefit press publishers. Instead of opting for broad and fair statutory authorization for non-commercial minor uses, the German government suggests trivial carve-outs for ""uses presumably authorized by law,"" which are not supposed to be blocked automatically by online platforms. However, the criteria for such uses are narrow and out of touch with reality. For example, the limit for minor use of text is 160 characters.By comparison, the maximum length of a tweet is 280 characters, which is barely enough substance for a proper quote. As those uses are only presumably authorized, they can still be disputed by rightsholders and blocked at a later stage if they infringe copyright. However, this did not prevent the German government from putting a price tag on such communication as service providers will have to pay the author an ""appropriate remuneration."" There are other problematic elements in the proposal, such as the plan to limit the use of parodies to uses that are ""justified by the specific purpose""—so better be careful about being too playful.It's now up to the German Parliament to decide whether to be more interested in the concerns of press publishers or in the erosion of user rights and freedoms. EFF will continue to reach out to Members of Parliament to help them make the right decision.While 2019 saw the EU ramming through a disastrous Internet copyright rule that continues to reverberate through legal and policy circles, 2020 was a very different story as the EU introduced the Digital Services Act (DSA), the most significant reform of Europe’s platform legislation the EU has...After lengthy consultations and many rumors and leaks, the European Commission has released its public draft of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which, along with the Digital Services Act (DSA,) represents the first major overhaul of EU Internet legislation in the 21st Century.

451,Misinformation-spewing cable companies come under scrutiny,Politics,https://theconversation.com/misinformation-spewing-cable-companies-come-under-scrutiny-153704,"
      Associate Professor of Journalism, University of Massachusetts Amherst
    Joshua Braun does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.University of Massachusetts Amherst provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US.View all partnersLooking at political violence in the U.S., a New Jersey state legislator sent a text message to an executive of cable television giant Comcast: “You feed this garbage, lies and all.” The cable channels Fox News and Newsmax were “complicit” in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection, the lawmaker, Assemblyman Paul Moriarty, said. Like other cable companies, Comcast brings those channels into American homes. What, Moriarty asked, was Comcast going to do about them in the wake of the assault on democracy?A few days later, Washington Post columnist Max Boot suggested Comcast might soon “need to step in and kick Fox News off,” as a consequence of its assistance to Trump’s incitement of insurrection. A similar suggestion by Democratic members of Congress ignited considerable controversy and became a subject of contention at a subsequent hearing on “disinformation and extremism in the media.”A CNN media reporter, Oliver Darcy, observed that Facebook, Twitter and Google have faced significant pressure to curb disinformation on their platforms – especially since Jan. 6. But, Darcy said, “somehow [cable providers] have escaped scrutiny and entirely dodged this conversation,” even though they are also “lending their platforms to dishonest companies that profit off of disinformation and conspiracy theories.”As a researcher who studies both television news distribution and how profit motivates the spread of falsehoods, I’m curious about whether it’s feasible – or wise – for cable companies to play moderator to the channels they carry.Since Jan. 6, social media companies have cracked down hard on disinformation campaigns, including cutting off President Donald Trump’s Twitter account. Amazon, Google and Apple also sharply reduced the reach of the Parler social network when that platform refused to remove posts apparently aimed at inciting violence – though Parler has since come back online.But disinformation is not happening online only. Fox News has increasingly come under fire for on-air staff and guests who hawk right-wing conspiracy theories, including spinning lies that voting machines somehow stole the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden.Fox is facing a multibillion-dollar lawsuit about those false claims. The company also recently paid at least US$10 million to settle a lawsuit from the family of a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer over falsely alleging the killing was part of a left-wing plot.Amid the threat of continued political violence, Fox News appears poised to further “turn up the outrage dial” on television. In recent months, the channel has lost viewers to even farther-right alternatives, like Newsmax and One America News Network, and is responding by firing traditional journalists and increasing the amount of partisan commentary it offers.Comcast, with 20 million subscribers, represents roughly a quarter of the pay TV market in the U.S., so it might seem Comcast has considerable leverage over Fox News’s content.But Comcast isn’t just a content distributor through its cable network. The company also owns a huge swath of American media companies, including Fox News’ direct competitors, MSNBC and CNBC. Even if Comcast felt an obligation to lean on Fox, any significant pressure it might seek to apply could easily be met not just with customer complaints, but with legal challenges claiming anti-competitive behavior, particularly if this included threats of kicking Fox off its platform.In the past, the American public has entrusted the responsibility of determining what sorts of communications do and don’t serve the public interest to public entities, like the Federal Communications Commission, which was originally the Federal Radio Commission.When radio and television broadcasting began, for instance, they relied exclusively on airwaves owned by the public and regulated by the government. At the height of their powers, from the 1930s through the postwar era, federal regulators tended to side with commercial station owners – as they do today. But periodically they demonstrated they could do much more than just fine broadcasters for airing obscenities. They did not shy away from stripping broadcast licenses from purveyors of harmful disinformation and inflammatory rumors. The most famous example is probably sham doctor John R. Brinkley, who advertised on air for questionable cures and sham surgeries, which killed dozens of people in the early 20th century before he lost his broadcast license.Moreover, federal court and Supreme Court decisions established that when the commission reviewed TV and radio stations’ past editorial content as part of considering whether to renew their broadcast licenses, it wasn’t violating their free speech rights. Rather, officials were vetting users of public resources in an effort to protect the public interest.Cable channels, of course, don’t need the public airwaves, and instead are distributed over privately owned networks. The owners of those systems, including Comcast, are the ones who decide which content providers can reach their subscribers. But their goals are not necessarily aligned with the public good so much as profit for shareholders.Comcast’s power in the media landscape has long been controversial. The company owns elements in every step of the media pipeline, from content creation to marketing and distribution to consumers. Critics contend that sort of consolidation is anti-competitive and deprives the public of the benefits of market competition, from decreasing the diversity of content to higher prices and weaker privacy protections.Media law scholar Tim Wu – who may be joining the Biden administration – has argued that media companies like Comcast should be regulated by a “separations principle” that would bar companies that owned distribution systems from also owning content creators. Such a restriction would almost certainly require Comcast to choose between its media production subsidiaries and its cable network. Whichever Comcast decided to keep or sell, the cable television system would be a standalone. It would no longer be a producer of content or a competitor with other channels – which might make it less fraught for the company to decide not to do business with content creators of any political stripe who spread inflammatory lies.Another possibility could be for cable companies to engage in some form of industry self-regulation. They might, for example, establish an independent board to examine problems like Fox’s disinformation spreading. The companies would have to agree to abide by the board’s decisions to sanction or suspend the distribution of channels trafficking in dangerous or inciting disinformation. Such an approach borrows from established methods in other media industries. These industries follow a model of appealing to independent boards to make controversial decisions, such as film or video game ratings, while blending in more recent self-regulatory measures by digital platforms.No version of self-regulation is perfect or above criticism. And it may seem worrisome to let cable companies, either individually or collectively, decide on what speech is acceptable for public consumption. Indeed, there is plenty of concern over whether Twitter or Facebook should be making similar decisions unilaterally.But it’s worth noting that government oversight has been weak for years, with many critics arguing that the FCC doesn’t do much to ensure that even traditional broadcasters promote the public interest.The cable industry may not use the airwaves, but it does use other scarce public resources, negotiating with local and regional governments to lay wires under streets and on telephone poles over sidewalks across the nation. Some cable companies even belong to or partner with cellular providers to deliver video wirelessly to mobile devices – which is very much like traditional broadcasting in the sense that it uses public airwaves. It’s not a huge stretch, then, to imagine local or even federal regulators treating cable TV more like broadcast channels, and even returning to past practices of requiring stations to serve the public interest.

452,The battery invented 120 years before its time,Hardware,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210223-the-battery-invented-120-years-too-soon,"MenuTraveling down a gravelly road in West Orange, New Jersey, an electric car sped by pedestrians, some clearly surprised by the vehicle's roomy interior. It travelled at twice the speed of the more conventional vehicles it overtook, stirring up dust that perhaps tickled the noses of the horses pulling carriages steadily along the street.It was the early 1900s, and the driver of this particular car was Thomas Edison. While electric cars weren't a novelty in the neighborhood, most of them relied on heavy and cumbersome lead-acid batteries. Edison had outfitted his car with a new type of battery that he hoped would soon be powering vehicles throughout the country: a nickel-iron battery. Building on the work of the Swedish inventor Ernst Waldemar Jungner, who first patented a nickel-iron battery in 1899, Edison sought to refine the battery for use in automobiles. Edison claimed the nickel-iron battery was incredibly resilient, and could be charged twice as fast as lead-acid batteries. He even had a deal in place with Ford Motors to produce this purportedly more efficient electric vehicle. But the nickel-iron battery did have some kinks to work out. It was larger than the more widely used lead-acid batteries, and more expensive. Also, when it was being charged, it would release hydrogen, which was considered a nuisance and could be dangerous.Unfortunately, by the time Edison had a more refined prototype, electric vehicles were on the way out in favour of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles that could go longer distances before needing to refuel or recharge. Edison's deal with Ford Motors fell by the wayside, though his battery continued to be used in certain niches such as railroad signalling, where its bulky size was not a hindrance.But more than a century later, engineers would rediscover the nickel-iron battery as something of a diamond in the rough. Now it is being investigated as an answer to an enduring challenge for renewable energy: smoothing out the intermittent nature of clean energy sources like wind and solar. And hydrogen, once considered a worrisome byproduct, could turn out to be one of the most useful things about these batteries.What used to be a dangerous quirk of the Edison battery has turned out to be remarkably useful (Credit: Alamy)Speeding forward to the mid 2010s, a research team at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands happened upon a use for the nickel-iron battery based on the hydrogen produced. When electricity passes through the battery as it’s being recharged, it undergoes a chemical reaction that releases hydrogen and oxygen. The team recognised the reaction as reminiscent of the one used to release hydrogen from water, known as electrolysis. ""It looked to me like the chemistry was the same,"" says Fokko Mulder, leader of the Delft University research team. This water-splitting reaction is one way hydrogen is produced for use as a fuel – and an entirely clean fuel too, provided the energy used to drive the reaction is from a renewable source.While Mulder and his team knew that the nickel-iron battery’s electrodes were capable of splitting water, they were surprised to see that the electrodes started to have a higher energy storage than before hydrogen was being produced. In other words, it became a better battery when it was used as an electrolyser too. They were also surprised to see how well the electrodes held up to the electrolysis, which can excessively tax and degrade more traditional batteries. ""And, of course, we were rather content that the energy efficiency appeared to be good during all this,"" says Mulder, reaching levels of 80-90%.Conventional electrolysers are employed to convert renewables to hydrogen, but Mulder hopes the battolyser could do this more efficiently and cheaply (Credit: Getty Images)Mulder dubbed their creation the ""battolyser"", and they hope their discovery can help solve two major challenges for renewable energy: energy storage and, when the batteries are full, production of clean fuel.""You'll hear all these discussions about batteries on the one hand and hydrogen on the other hand,"" says Mulder. ""There's always been a kind of competition between those two sets of directions, but you basically need both.""Renewable valueOne of the biggest challenges of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is how unpredictable and intermittent they can be. With solar, for example, you have a surplus of energy produced during the daytime and summertime, but at night and in the winter months, the supply dwindles.Conventional batteries, such as those based on lithium, can store energy in the short-term, but when they’re fully charged they have to release any excess or they could overheat and degrade. The nickel-iron battolyser, on the other hand remains stable when fully charged, at which point it can transition to making hydrogen instead.""[Nickel-iron batteries] are resilient, being able to withstand undercharging and overcharging better than other batteries,"" says John Barton, a research associate at the School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University in the UK, who also researches battolysers. ""With hydrogen production, the battolyser adds multi-day and even inter-seasonal energy storage.""Besides creating hydrogen, nickel-iron batteries have other useful traits, first and foremost that they are unusually low-maintenance. They are extremely durable, as Edison proved in his early electric car, and some have been known to last upwards of 40 years. The metals needed to make the battery – nickel and iron – are also more common than, say, cobalt which is used to make conventional batteries.This means the battolyser could have another possible role for renewable energy: helping it become more profitable.Like any other industry, renewable energy prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. On a bright, sunny day there might be an abundance of power from solar, which can lead to a glut and a dip in the price the energy can be sold for. The battolyser, however, could help smooth out those peaks and troughs.""When electricity prices are high, then you can discharge this battery, but when the electricity price is low, you can charge the battery and make hydrogen,"" says Mulder.The battolyser is one way to help balance the supply and demand of renewable energy from sources like solar and wind (Credit: Alamy)The battolyser is not alone in this regard. More traditional alkaline electrolysers coupled with batteries can perform this function too, and are widespread in the hydrogen-producing industry. Mulder thinks the battolyser can do the same thing for less money and for longer, thanks to the durability of the system. It is something that is making the battolyser's backers hopeful.And while hydrogen is the direct product of the battolyser, other useful substances can be generated from it too, such as ammonia or methanol, which are typically easier to store and transport. ""Having a battolyser in place, [an] ammonia plant would run more constantly and [would] need less manpower, reducing operating costs and maintenance costs, thus producing ammonia the cheapest way in a sustainable, green manner,"" says Hans Vrijenhoef, chief executive of Proton Ventures, who has invested in Mulder's battolyser.Scaling up Right now, the largest battolyser in existence is 15kW/15kWh, and has enough battery capacity and long-term hydrogen storage to power 1.5 households. A larger version of a 30kW/30kWh battolyser is in the works at the Magnum power station in Eemshaven in the Netherlands, where it will provide enough hydrogen to satisfy the needs of the power station.Once it's undergone rigorous testing there, the aim is to scale-up further and distribute the battolyser to green energy producers, such as solar and wind farms. Ultimately, the battolyser's proponents hope it will reach gigawatt-scale – equivalent to the power generated by around 400 utility-scale wind turbines. Though as well as scaling-up, Barton sees a role for smaller battolysers, which could help supply energy to mini-grids used by remote communities that don't live on main power grids.Edison's laboratory in New Jersey was the birthplace of many of his inventions, both those that gained popularity in his lifetime and those that didn't (Credit: Alamy)The fact that the battolyser's electrodes are made from relatively cheap and common metals may help. And unlike lithium, nickel and iron do not create large quantities of water waste when mined, nor are they linked to significant environmental degradation.Still, both Mulder and Barton see hurdles to overcome in terms of efficiency and capacity. ""The battolyser would really benefit from increased power capacity as a battery, or reduced internal resistance,"" says Barton. Internal resistance is the opposition to the flow of current in a battery. The higher the internal resistance, the lower the efficiency. Improving that is something Mulder and his team are now working on.Much of the potential of the battolyser has been hiding in plain sight, ever since Thomas Edison first began experimenting with his nickel-iron battery at the turn of the 20th Century. He may have been wrong in believing his battery would supplant the other vehicles on the road. But the nickel-iron battery may yet play a role in replacing fossil fuels more broadly, by helping hasten the transition to renewables.--The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

Perseverance memorialized the heroic death of its robotic friend. The Perseverance Mars rover's ""sky crane"" descent stage made the ultimate sacrifice last week, and we now have a photo to memorialize the flying robot's heroic death.The rocket-powered sky crane lowered the car-sized Perseverance rover to the floor of Mars' Jezero Crater on cables last Thursday (Feb. 18), bringing the rover's harrowing ""seven minutes of terror"" entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence to a successful end. Just after the rover's wheels touched down, the sky crane flew off to crash-land intentionally a safe distance away — and Perseverance snapped a photo of the impact's immediate aftermath, NASA announced Wednesday (Feb. 24).Video: Perseverance spots sky crane's Mars impact plume after touchdown

Within two minutes of safely delivering me to the surface of Mars, I caught the smoke plume on one of my Hazcams [hazard-avoidance cameras] from its intentional surface impact — an act that protected me and the scientific integrity of my landing site,"" agency officials wrote via the mission's official Twitter account, @NASAPersevere.A moment of respect for the descent stage. Within two minutes of safely delivering me to the surface of Mars, I caught the smoke plume on one of my Hazcams from its intentional surface impact — an act that protected me and the scientific integrity of my landing site. pic.twitter.com/bG4dekrbvJFebruary 24, 2021Perseverance documented its EDL in unprecedented detail, capturing high-definition video with multiple cameras as it blazed through the Martian sky toward Jezero's floor. That epic video shows key events in the touchdown sequence, including the deployment of the mission's supersonic parachute and the moment the rover's six wheels hit the red dirt.Other robotic eyes were watching on Thursday as well. For example, the HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the Red Planet since 2006, snapped a photo of Perseverance gliding through the alien skies beneath its parachute. And a day later, HiRISE imaged mission hardware on the ground — not just Perseverance, but also its sky crane, heat shield and parachute-backshell combo in their various resting spots within Jezero.Perseverance is the centerpiece of the $2.7 billion Mars 2020 mission, which will hunt for signs of ancient life and collect and cache dozens of samples for eventual return to Earth. The rover is still going through its post-landing checkouts, but it has already begun imaging its surroundings in detail.For instance, the mission team just released a high-definition, 360-degree panorama of the landing site stitched together from 142 images captured by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z camera system. The gorgeous photo provides our best look yet at Jezero Crater, which long ago harbored a river delta that spilled into a lake hundreds of feet deep.We'll learn much more about this mysterious place after Perseverance gets fully up and running.

454,Nvidia made $5 billion during a GPU shortage and expects to do it again in Q1,Business,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299505/nvidia-earnings-q4-2021-quarterly-gpu-shortage-revenue,"Filed under:It hasn’t changed its outlook on GPU availabilityNvidia has shared its Q4 2021 earnings, and despite the company’s GPUs being in extremely low supply, it didn’t seem to hurt how much money the company made. In fact, it reported a record $5 billion in revenue, which is up 61 percent year-over-year. What’s more impressive is that Nvidia expects to make another $5 billion in revenue during Q1 2022. This positive outlook is surprising given that Q1 is generally slower than other quarters, even for the biggest tech companies, as it follows the rush of people buying lots of products during the holiday period. It’s generally a slower period in general for product releases across tech and gaming. Also, let’s not forget the GPU shortage is still happening. Nvidia reiterated that sparse supply will continue through the next quarter, but that’s likely factored into its rosy revenue prediction.Nvidia says it expects most of that $5 billion revenue estimate in Q1 2022 to come from the gaming market, despite being the segment it’s currently having the toughest time serving. Since the launch of the RTX 30-series desktop graphics cards, leading with the RTX 3080, 3090, 3070, and followed by other products, Nvidia hasn’t been able to meet the demand — though it’s not the only company affected. AMD has also struggled, perhaps more than Nvidia, to keep a steady stock of graphics cards heading to retailers. My colleague Sean Hollister got comments from both companies on the shortage. The ongoing pandemic has certainly played a role in this, and possibly the shortage of semiconductor chips. Nvidia recently announced that it’s trying to make it easier for gamers, not cryptocurrency miners, to get its RTX 3060 desktop graphics card that’s releasing tomorrow for $329. It’s doing that by implementing GPU driver software that weakens its ability to farm Ethereum by half, in an effort to discourage crypto miners from buying it. It will also introduce its CMP dedicated mining processor in March, which Nvidia is making to serve the mining community with the hope that they’ll leave more of the gaming GPUs for gamers to purchase. Interestingly, Nvidia said during its investor call that cryptocurrency-related sales accounted for a small slice of its total revenue — just $300 million of $5 billion, suggesting that miners didn’t play a major role in the GPU shortage.A newsletter about computers"

Laptops these days are slimmer, sleeker, and lighter than ever—but their repairability and configurability are taking enormous hits in the process. Framework is seeking to roll back the clock in a good way with its first product, the upcoming Framework 13.5-inch laptop.Following the lead of companies like Fairphone, the startup is focused on respecting users' right to repair by building systems focused on modular design, with components that are easily configured, replaced, and even upgraded.Although Framework's raison d'être revolves around modularity, the company clearly understands that it can't sacrifice sleek, lightweight design if it wants to maintain a wide appeal. It describes its first product, the upcoming Framework laptop, as ""similar to a Dell XPS... thin, not some massive block."" The early product shots and specifications seem to bear that out:Framework's off-the-cuff comparison seems pretty reasonable, with specs equivalent to or slightly better than those available on Dell's XPS 13. It is 0.1kg heavier and 1.1mm thicker than the XPS 13—but we don't think that's going to be a deal breaker for most people.You can go a long way toward making a laptop repairable by simply including standard sockets rather than soldering everything down to the board. I've been personally frustrated with the latter practice many times this year—soldered components not only prevent you from repairing laptops when they fail, but in many cases, they stop you from even configuring machines as you'd prefer.Framework pledges to do away with all of that—specifications, product shots, and even video shared with us in confidence show easily accessible sockets for RAM, storage, and Wi-Fi. The company also pledges to offer future motherboard swaps to allow for upgrading the CPU without replacing the entire laptop—although frankly, we're a bit extra-skeptical about that claim until we see it in action; it's difficult to predict how physical layouts and thermal needs will change with entire future hardware generations.Beyond the standard sockets we used to expect from laptops, Framework will introduce the concept of configurable external ports. Instead of building the chassis with a specific port layout, the machine has been designed with four bays that fit what the company is calling ""Expansion Cards""—these offer USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD, and even 3.5mm headphone ports. With this system, users will be able to decide for themselves not only what ports they need but which side of the laptop to put them on.Finally, the company pledges to make the Framework laptop user-serviceable by focusing on ease of replacement—and availability—of frequently replaced parts, including battery, screen, keyboard, and bezel. The company also pledges to open up its hardware ecosystem to third parties, which will be able to design, build, and sell compatible modules via a Framework Marketplace.Framework is promising an awful lot in its very first product—""thin as an XPS 13, repairable as a custom-built gaming PC"" is a pretty tall order to live up to. We very much want to believe, but it's going to take a full Ars Technica teardown before we're completely convinced.Although we're skeptical, we are hopeful—the fledgling company does have a pretty solid pedigree. Framework founder Nirav Patel was Oculus VR's head of hardware from 2012 to 2017, and he was a Facebook director of engineering beyond that. The company's team also includes design, engineering, and operations people hailing from Apple, Google, and Lenovo.The Framework laptop is expected to become widely available this summer—and a company representative promised us a hands-on review unit as soon as one becomes available.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

456,Facebook bowed to demands from Turkey to block one of its military opponents,Politics,https://www.engadget.com/facebook-turkey-emails-200407588.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADMoOyGEB4xLte8dZ9CeyurQZQbYumB-eqS8I-bdg9vXv8SuCHqi5BWFofcmrzfPEw5kOf39AX0Ts46ELngSuxmkE_3TBPzbsd9WfCZp1tgI7ydalsXpMRBg0Pzmw73ZCHHgnVheJ8PDiVtcTKrVZp_ciduHBOsuuZYfHOzCYiF6,"When Turkey launched its Afrin offensive in early 2018 to dislodge Kurdish minorities from Northern Syria, the country ordered Facebook to block the page of a prominent militia group in the area known as the People’s Protection Units or YPG. Forced to make a decision, the company prioritized staying online over objecting to censorship, new internal emails obtained by ProPublica show.Since then, the social media giant has blocked users in Turkey from accessing the YPG’s Facebook page. Facebook complied with the order even though, like the US government, it does not consider the group a terrorist organization.“... We are in favor of geo-blocking YPG content if the prospects of a full-service blockage are great,” the team that accessed the situation wrote to Joel Kaplan, the company’s vice-president of global public policy. “Geo-blocking the YPG is not without risk — activists outside of Turkey will likely notice our actions, and our decision may draw unwanted attention to our overall geo-blocking policy.”The subsequent discussion was short. When Kaplan told Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg he agreed with the recommendation, Sandberg sent a single-sentence response. “I am fine with this,” she said.When asked about the emails, Facebook confirmed it blocked the page after it received a legal order from the Turkish government. “We strive to preserve voice for the greatest number of people. There are, however, times when we restrict content based on local law even if it does not violate our community standards,” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told ProPublica. “In this case, we made the decision based on our policies concerning government requests to restrict content and our international human rights commitments. Publicly, Facebook has also said free speech is one of its core tenets. “We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, and we work hard to protect and defend these values around the world,” it said in a recent blog post on Turkey.In many ways, the story of Facebook's YPG ban is one of poor transparency. In the same above statement, the company noted it discloses content restrictions in its biannual transparency reports. However, YPG isn’t explicitly mentioned on the section of its website it has dedicated to Turkey. And if you try to visit the group’s page through a Turkish server using a VPN, the only error message you will see is one that says, “the link may be broken, or the page may have been removed.” Please enter a valid email address"
